It requires some player investment to properly follow the narrative, and combat at even the normal difficulty level  can prove punishing for the button mashers amongst us, but The Witcher 2 is a wonderful follow up to the first game in the series. If you\u2019re a fan of atmospheric and complex RPG\u2019s you can\u2019t go wrong with this one.[/quote]\n\nAfter introducing Geralt of Rivia in the The Witcher, a mostly successful blend of questing and combat, CDPR had a problem. The format that they\u2019d established in that first game, almost comparable to a cRPG, just wouldn\u2019t work so well with a larger, console owning, audience. It\u2019s with that in mind that the Witcher 2 Assassin of Kings is a giant leap forward in terms of gameplay, modernising it and moving slap bang into third person action RPG territory. Where The Witcher Enhanced Edition feels somewhat dated by today\u2019s standards (but still very much worth the journey), The Witcher 2 wears its age much more gracefully. But is it worth your time investment?\n\nFirst, to assuage the fears of those who haven\u2019t played the preceding game, The Witcher 2 is essentially standalone. Yes there are a few doffs of the cap to events of the past, and you\u2019ll lack some familiarity with the characters established in Geralt\u2019s journey thus far, but there will be no major difficulties kicking off your adventure here. Nevertheless the story does follow on from the end of the first game, so those who do have an acquaintance with the events of The Witcher will be pleased to see that continue here. The narrative, disseminated to the player through gameplay, cutscenes and Geralt\u2019s journal, can be dense and convoluted, telling a tale of politics and scheming, a literal game of thrones. Without liberal dips into the letters and notes Geralt finds, and if the player doesn\u2019t invest some time into reading his journal entries, it\u2019d be easy to get lost in the overarching storyline. \n\nBut it\u2019s well worth it, and the tale told is interesting and well-paced, never letting the player feel directionless or lost.  Furthermore, The Witcher 2 features branching paths, which adds increasing layers to the deeper story. Without journeying down both routes a lot of detail can be missed, and thanks to a difference in quest allocation and character motivations, a second run-through remains interesting and enjoyable. As with the first game the decisions made along the way can be difficult, and have plot impact, which in turn doesn\u2019t make the split feel like a lazy way of increasing game length. And certainly this time Geralt feels like a player in the main event, rather than a \u201cgopher\u201d, running between talking heads.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, as mentioned above, this is very much in the third person ARPG mould, with gamepad support fully featured this time around. If anything there are too many functions to be mapped to a controller, but it works well enough with only the occasional frustration of too many trips to the pause menu. Gone are the rhythm based combat and multiple attack stances of the first game, replaced with a much more tactical type of combat. Rush into battle mashing the attack buttons (light or heavy) and Geralt will end up dead, especially if he\u2019s facing multiple foes. More so than ever, Geralt must use alchemical preparations, potions and oils, prior to combat and utilise his Witcher Signs (read magic) to grant him the upper hand, and take advantage of guard breaks and rear attacks. If anything Geralt can feel underpowered in this regard \u2013 from time to time it\u2019d be nice just to rush in and overpower a couple of poorly trained soldiers but doing so will quickly disprove Geralt\u2019s legendary status.\n\nLootable objects are highlighted via the use of Geralt\u2019s wolf medallion, which has a cool down, and it\u2019s here that many players will look to mods. Simply making collectable objects glow all the time feels like a huge benefit, and constant medallion pings can get a little tiresome outside of quest objectives. Additionally dice poker and boxing have been changed from the first game. The latter is now a simple quick time event, whilst the former is now less fun, with at times inscrutable numbering on the dice, and potential out of bounds throws made worse by the isometric table view. Of course both are optional, and QTE\u2019s for boxing are merely a change rather than a problem, but the dice game feels like a notable downgrade.\n\nDespite its age The Witcher 2 isn\u2019t bad looking either, and anyone going into this with the awareness of its pedigree will not be overly disappointed. Of course there are some signs of visual age, but character animations are good, world design is effective and on the whole the voice acting is good too. Funnily enough, the first game felt more bustling and alive than its successor, but I\u2019d put that down more to locations that are featured than anything else. Sound effects and music are also efficient at generating the requisite atmosphere, although at times Geralt\u2019s quips can get a little repetitive (if you\u2019re not fed up with how badly he thinks the enemy smells by the end of the game then you haven\u2019t been listening!)\n\nCompletion of The Witcher 2 will easily breach the 40 hour mark, and a devoted player can readily double that with the advanced difficulty levels and Arena mode. And whilst at times frustratingly difficult, reassessing tactics and proper preparation will yield startlingly different results. With a complex and intriguing story, variety of gameplay and branching paths, and of course with its successor in mind (go for the trilogy!) The Witcher 2 is an easy recommendation.", "timestamp_created": 1549719839, "timestamp_updated": 1549724076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645603358745574951", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48864200": {"recommendationid": "48864200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245320544", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550566797}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a wonderful game!

I do like games that have deep and mature narratives.  I also like games with complex combat mechanics.  I heard that this game was very good at these things, so I decided to give it a try.\n\nThe story is  very good.  It is also very complex so it is important to pay attention to the dialog.  Player choices definitely have an impact on the game world and many choices are morally ambiguous which tie-in well to the mature theme of the story.  What impressed me the most was how much impact player choice dynamically altered the game world and the direction of the story.  The game has 8 different endings based on the player's decisions.  This is also the only game that I have ever played that completely alters the main quest line depending on these choices.  This means that you will not see every main story quest, characters and locations unless you play the game through multiple times.  Many games that change the world based on choices usually do so using trickery that gives you the \"illusion\" of choice.  The developers of this game actually took the time to create all of the extra story content instead of using tricks and this gives the Witcher 2 a ton of replayability.\n\nThe combat system in this game is also very deep and challenging.  You will carry a steel sword to take care of humanoid opponents and you will carry a silver sword to deal with monsters.  Knowing when to switch is important to dealing proper damage to your target.  Combat also requires proper preparation so the player will need to know how and when to use magical signs, place traps, drink potions, oil swords and use bombs and other Witcher tricks to get the job done.  Simply wading into the combat only slashing away with a sword will often times get you killed.  Combat can take some time to get used to and is definitely a refreshing departure from simply auto targeting and mashing a single button.\n\nVisuals are very impressive and it is very apparent that the developers took a lot of time in creating the environments for the game.  Music is outstanding and the score sets the tone appropriately.\n\nOne of the few downsides that I can think of is the disparity of the difficulty levels.  Normal difficulty can be daunting with the complex combat mechanics and is a bit harder than the normal difficulty level of similar games.  Easy is a nod to RPG beginners, but is so easy that you can ignore most of the combat mechanics and simply survive every encounter by using only the swords.  The only other downside that I had with the game was related to map design.  I found navigation on some of the maps to be overly complicated and I spent a lot of time simply wandering about trying to find a way to get to certain points on the map.  Other than these two small quibbles I found the game design to be very solid and entertaining.\n\nLots of content in this game.  My playthrough took about 40 hours doing most of the side activities, and I mostly took my time without rushing things.  Additional playthroughs would be required to see the other 7 endings and to play the other story paths leading up to those endings.  You can easily get hundreds of hours out of this game if you wanted to explore all of these options so lots of replay value as I mentioned earlier.\n\nI highly recommend this game.  I understand that the Witcher 3 is supposed to expand to a much more open world environment and have even more non-linear story options.

This title puts you back in the hands of Geralt of Rivia; however, this time, the consequences of your actions merit even greater twists and deeper turns.  Not only changing the NPC's outlook on you; instead, you may find yourself in a completely different area of the game had you chosen your actions otherwise.  To stack on the improvements, this game features a much smoother combat system and graphical enhancements so beautiful, you will need a new F12 key (screenshot) by the time you finish this story once.  \n\nAs an avid explorer of games, one play through of this game granted roughly 50 hours of play time on Hard difficulty.

Assuming you're into rpg's (otherwise i don't see any reason you're here), and want to get your mind blown away, then this game is for you. I can't possibly describe how fantastic Witcher 2 is. While the \"general\" story might not be something outstanding, the way you progress through it, the way you interact with people completely engulfs you into the experience, and you won't even realize when it's already 5 am, and you've been playing for 12 hours at least. This is partly because of the side missions. Unlike other rpg's where they are mediocre at best, and mainly consist of something like \"Get to point B, Talk to someone, Return, ????, PROFIT\", side missions in Witcher 2 are self contained stories, some of them being more enjoyable than the main game itself. And of course if you don't want to do them for whatever reason, you'll miss A LOT. \nAnother thing at which Witcher 2 excels is the combat. While at low difficulty you should be able to complete the game by \"pressing X to win\", other difficulty settings require knowledge, thinking, and tactical aproach. You'll have to create mixtures, craft weapons and armor, find or buy herbs and recipes, just in order to be able to survive. While this might be confusing, and hard, trust me that it's not. It's understandable, it's logical, and requires just a little bit of initial effort. \nAt this point you're probably thinking \"Yeah, cool, i'll go buy it\", and you won't be wrong in any way. BUT, be advised that while this is a great looking game, it isn't particulary well optimised,  and you may find yourself struggling even at minimum settings if your PC isn't powerful enough.  \nSo what is my score for the game? Definitely 10/10.

I've now played this game 3 times through on Normal/Dark/Insane and am still missing a few sidequests that are only available on certain plot decisions. This game is massive and very well done. Here are some random pros & cons for things that immediately come to mind:\n\n[u]PROS[/u]\n[b]+[/b] Gorgeous. This game is gorgeous. Especially if you grab an improved textures mod. (see related con)\n[b]+[/b] Story-rich. The story is grandiose and tons of fun to be a part of. There are quite a few story-altering decisions you will make throughout the game as well, providing a dynamic and involved experience.(one decision determines a good third of the game that differs completely should you have chosen differently) There were a couple choices where I had to pause the game for like 20 minutes while trying to decide what I wanted to do. Intense stuff. LISTEN TO ALL DIALOGUE, TALK TO EVERYONE. You won't regret it.\n[b]+[/b] Combat is very dynamic and an absolute blast. You really need to think about the best way to approach certain encounters. Alchemy can alter things drastically for example, so don't skimp on the potions/oils(especially on higher difficulties!). Certain enemies need to be approached certain ways, some are very resistant to sword or magic, some can shield up and block all damage so you need to approach them from another direction or use a specific sign, etc... Very well done and very well thought out by the development team.\n\n\n[u]PROS/CONS(depending on your preferences/playstyle)[/u]\n[b]+/-[/b] Game starts out pretty damn difficult during the prologue. You start very weak and then slowly gain strength until all at once, you are suddenly quite over-powered. This could be a pro or con depending on what sort of gaming experience you prefer. There *are* a couple mods that smooth out the combat system and even out your ascension to badassness, although I would highly recommend you not touch any sort of mods til you've completed your first playthrough.\n[b]+/-[/b] Quite a bit of nudity and corny sex scenes. May or may not be your cup of tea.\n\n[u]CONS[/u]\n[b]-[/b] While the game is gorgeous, it is also quite resource intensive. I had serious issues with my 560m, almost unplayable. My desktop's gtx 780 had no issues. Check out benchmarks for your specific card and make sure you can run it decently.\n[b]-[/b] QTE's(Quicktime Events) are a part of this game and they are lame. There are a couple encounters where if you miss a QTE prompt, you are dead. Playing on insane, this feels cheap and lame. *Luckily*, You can turn these off via Gameplay Options, which I would highly recommend.\n[b]-[/b] Prologue is pretty damn linear. Don't let this turn you off though. It's necessary for the introduction of the story. Make it to chapter 1 and things improve greatly.\n[b]-[/b] A lot of people have reported that the controls feel \"clunky\", especially during the prologue. I was one of these people. But seriously, stick with it. It gets better. Also, graphic settings affect control sensitivity. Higher = better response. I also played the game with a controller, so that could have some impact.\n\n[b]Overall conclusion: If you like RPGs, this is a must play. The story is intense and exciting. The gameplay is dynamic and fun. I highly recommend you give it a go. Just make it past the prologue! Also, a few people have asked whether it's necessary to play the first game. My answer is NO. It's not necessary.

It is a solid RPG with a lot of action and a brilliant story. It is very mature in a lot of its themes and situations. This game is based on novels written by a Polish authornamed  Andrzej Sapkowski. You play as Geralt, a Witcher, or a genetically enhanced monster hunter. They have been described as a kind of warrior monk. Geralt drinks special potions that let him far exceed the abilities of normal humans. These potions are needed to battle the various beasts of the realms. Witchers also have a very limited understanding of magical energy called Witcher's Signs. Basically the Signs are spells, like a fireball and a paralysis trap spell and a few others. Geralt is an interesting character because he is not quite human but hes not a monster either. Due to their methods and abilities, however, many in the world see Witchers as freaks and monsters. Which is really what the game's ideology is all about; the greyness in everyone, not the clear cut black and white. Which to me, is a welcome change from the usual: 1) \"hey I'm a good guy I will help you\"  2) \"Not my problem Kachinsky\" 3) F*** YOU F*** FACE,\" that many other game are notorious for.  Geralt is often put in positions of just making a choice, not good or evil, just difficult decisions that have a lot of positives and negatives to them. The story is top notch, and eerily real in many of the stuggles of the world. \n\nGeralt has a set of skill trees (sword, magic, alchemy) that the player can advance in any way. All into one or spliced between the three. Sword fighting is a core mechanic though, so no matter how you play, Geralt will always have two swords. A silver sword for monsters, and a normal sword for humans. There are a few other weapons too but mostly its swords. Depending on the player preference combat can be a bit like the Batman games, or the Assassins Creed games. In some ways it can be like Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. Weapons and armor play a big part as well and can effect all of the skill trees. Making the game very balanced between gear and character tree choices. Not to the crazy levels of a Diablo game but enough to make for a very quality rpg.\n\nMostly though, Witcher 2 is a lot like skyrim. I do not want to bash on skyrim here, it is also a great game that a lot of people absolutely love. I feel, however, that Witcher is far better than skyrim and think the people that love skyrim should try the Witcher. Both games have the northern lore and feel. Witcher 2 is no where near as large or open as skyrim. Witcher is much more linear but the story and combat and the world just feel so much better in every way to me. The enemies and the different races were better portrayed during the game. When I came to a new town in skyrim I did not get that feeling of truly new. Just another town and another barbarian guy leading it. Witcher was totally different, you get the feeling of racial tensions and social tensions in every part. The powers that be are very different and each very developed and very human. As it plays out you really see how the choices alter the world, instead of it coming down to \"OK I'm a good guy so I will save good guy town.\" A lot of games try to get that feeling across of the characters true M.O. and demeanor but fail. Witcher acomplishes this very well. Triple AAA quality. Superb graphics, superb voice acting. I enjoyed every character. There were a few times, of course, where some tones were a bit off but that happens in every game. Overall amazing game. When I learned that this game was made by a small studio in Poland I was shocked.\n\nAs someone who never read any of the books and did not play the first game, I found that after a second playthrough the story and everyhting started to click and I realised how well done everything really was. The way the game is, one would want to play it at least twice to see both sides of what is going on.\nIt seems as though more than a few people found the game to be really difficult. It can be, but now there are plenty of guides and discussions about it. The game has a kind of reverse curve for the difficulty. It is much harder in the beginning due to a lack of points in the skill tree and low grade weapons and armor. By the end though, Geralt is pretty much on par with jezuz. I like games of this nature, because being really stong at the end makes it feel like you really acomplished something. \n\nThis game also has subtitles in many languages so I found it made a great gift for steam friends who are not natural to the english language.\n\nI would reccommend this game to anyone. Especially anyone who likes Skyrim, Assassin's Creed, Batman, Chivalry, Darksouls, Lord of the Rings or any games like them.", "timestamp_created": 1420004324, "timestamp_updated": 1420004324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 191, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.911562204360961914", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39639761": {"recommendationid": "39639761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056596883", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456888890}, "language": "english", "review": "Why are there only ever sex scenes when my parents walk in?", "timestamp_created": 1517006492, "timestamp_updated": 1517006492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 120, "votes_funny": 395, "weighted_vote_score": "0.880594611167907715", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12452251": {"recommendationid": "12452251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007416237", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412541948}, "language": "english", "review": "Note: With The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition I entered the Witcher universe without playing the first title or knowing anything about the books let alone having read them. So here goes.\n\nThe first RPG I played where your choices actually DO matter (*cough* Mass Effect *cough*). Yes, I kid you not. Not only does the game split up after Act I depending on who you choose to side with, but the outcome of dialogues in the main quest and even the side quests offer multiple possibilites for the story to unfold. The complexity and ingenuity of the fantasy world this game is set in is comparable to the quality of GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire and can therefore be characterized as a so-called \"low fantasy\" story, as opposed to \"high fantasy\" settings such as The Elder Scrolls (just google the definitions if you don't know anything about them). Personally, I prefer low fantasy due to its focus on individual character development and their story/fate, as well as a \"realistic\" depiction of violence, language and society as a whole, but that's just my preference. So in a nutshell, I liked the story a lot, I think there's a lot of exciting things still to be told. \n\nNow let's get to the technical aspects: Dialogue is great, offering many choices for convincing or intimidating and alike. Character customization is solid too (you can actually have your haircut changed to some very weird stuff throughout the game if you so desire), there's lots of item slots, but only two weapons, a fact I can however accept for story reasons. Then again, I always pick the sword in any fantasy RPG so having two different swords throughout the entire game was right down my alley. \nSince we've arrived at the swords let's talk about the combat shall we. Yeah, I don't like it, why don't I like it you might say? It's basically a combo-based hack'n'slash system with a very console-y feeling (believe me or not, I liked Skyrim combat more, yes really). You just lock onto a target and smash LMB/RMB with the occasional blocking. I think this is simplistic and may be fun to watch, but it's not really immersive (on a side note: the combat is pretty hard and the boss fight require true skill and creativity and especially cunning use of magic abilities, I liked these a lot more). Speaking of immersive, the game looks gorgeous for a 2011 title, mostly good textures and effects. What struck me was the very high depth of field especially in the first act. I guess that's a way to make the lack of quality of distant objects unnoticable. Arguably, the biggest plus is the sound: ambient sound, voice acting and especially soundtrack are downright masterful, I loved it.\n\nI can't think of anything else atm so let's jump to the conclusion. The game is great, with lots of replayability due to the many different paths you can go. The world sucks you in right from the start. If you're a fan of the combat then you've got absolutely nothing to fear, if you don't it's still worth it for the experience because mechanics are easy to get used to.\n\nPerformance notes: The game is Nvidia optimized. With my AMD card(s), it runs a solid 60fps though. Just tweak AA a bit and turn off Cinematic Depth of Field, it makes cutscene-fps drop by half, which is not cool. It supports CFX and probably also SLI. Oh yeah and the game is capped to 120fps, which is nice too.\n\nMeaningless score: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1413050450, "timestamp_updated": 1413050450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 186, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.884705305099487305", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7766100": {"recommendationid": "7766100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060757903", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 8508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495307811}, "language": "english", "review": "First off, know that The Witcher 2 is not a game that will hold your hand.

This a game which deals with many adult themes such as politics, racism and sex to deliver a mature and complex game supported by rich lore and stunning visuals. \n\nThe writing and storytelling is exceptional throughout and the moral ambiguity and choices are second to none. The gameplay, in particular the combat, is an acquired taste but offers a refreshing level of depth and potential for improvisation when compared to games in a similar genre. Sound design and voice acting is also of high quality, with the environments coming to life through impressive visual and audio support and characters each sporting distinct personalities and prejudices.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that if you have played the first Witcher game, your choices and gear will be reflected via an imported save in The Witcher 2, however the choices have limited effect and it is not necessary to play the first game to enjoy the second (however you will be at a slight disadvantage in some situations).\n\nIn my honest opinion the experience as a whole is unparalleled, and The Witcher 2 is easily the most enjoyable and immersive RPG I have played in recent memory. I would also advise reading the books by Andrezej Sapkowski as these offer an interesting insight into the protagonist's past. But back to the game, overall I would highly recommend The Witcher 2 to anyone with at least a passing interest in the RPG genre, it is the definition of a complete gaming package with spectacular production values and a lasting impression.", "timestamp_created": 1385473501, "timestamp_updated": 1479938157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 837, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.937793731689453125", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9181187": {"recommendationid": "9181187", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984391739", "num_games_owned": 1072, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 3082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1392804373}, "language": "english", "review": "Originally released in 2011, The Witcher 2 flew under the radar for a lot of people and was overshadowed by the ever-popular Skyrim. While not as well known, The Witcher 2 offers a much stronger narrative along with solid gameplay, beautiful graphics, and varied areas.\n\nYou once again play as the Witcher; Geralt, who finds himself protecting King Foltest of Temaria after an assassination attempt. Ultimately, the second attempt succeeds and Geralt is framed for the murder. After escaping from a Temarian dungeon, Geralt decides to track down the real kingslayer in order to clear his name while trying to piece together his fragmented memory.\n\nThe game is separated into three chapters each with their own main area along with a handful of side-quests. These areas are structured and paced well, allowing room for exploration without straying too far from the main storyline. The decisions you make along the way directly influence the narrative and can have a dramatic effect on the rest of the game. For example; decisions made in the first chapter can completely change the second, allowing plenty of room for re-playability. The game also features multiple endings, which vary based on your choices.\n\nThe choices are morally ambiguous; there is no clear right or wrong answer in most cases. It\u2019s more about choosing a side and watching the events unfold. While the first Witcher game focused more on slaying monsters, Geralt is trapped in the middle of political turmoil in this installment. These elements of the story add an additional level of complexity and immersion as the game feels almost similar to a season of Game of Thrones. Playing the first game is by no means necessary to enjoying The Witcher 2 as it provides plenty of backstory as well as a solid and cohesive narrative.\n\nThe combat is solid as the game will have you balance between swordplay, magic, as well as parrying and dodging. The use of traps can also add an additional level of strategy and planning to most encounters. There is also the inclusion of alchemy, allowing Geralt to drink various potions each with different passive bonuses as well as negative side effects. The potions are generally used on a trial and error basis though, since Geralt isn\u2019t able to use them during combat. The game does provide a reasonable challenge, especially on the harder difficulties, which is refreshing compared to a lot of other titles released these days.\n\nOrens, the main currency in the game is rather scarce, placing a large emphasis on crafting. The crafting system is solid and will have you hoarding as many resources as possible in order to create various armor, traps, weapons, and upgrades.\n\nCD Projekt Red is a company that really loves their fans. While other developers release paid DLC, CDPR released an Enhanced Edition at no additional cost which added multiple cut-scenes, quests, and additional polish. \n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic, as it really adds an epic feel to the game. The voice acting for the main characters is top-notch while some of the acting for the additional characters is re-used but that is to be expected considering the overall length of the game.\n\nThe graphics are absolutely stunning, as the environments are extremely detailed and varied. The character models and armor look great, although the facial animations can be a bit stiff and lifeless at times. You really have to look hard for low-res textures as even the smallest objects are carefully rendered.\n\nOverall, The Witcher 2 is a game that should be played by anyone that is a fan of the genre. It features benchmark graphics, a top-shelf narrative, and offers plenty of content along with elements of re-playability.\n\nFor a much more detailed and thorough review, here\u2019s a video I edited together for my friend Trent:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEPbEpWHMeo\n\nThe Witcher 2 also made our list for the greatest games released over the past 8 years.

Compared to the Witcher 1 - the combat is greatly improved. It is challenging, makes you think twice before you engage into combat. Graphics and esthetics were stunning for a game this old. Storytelling - it simply sucks you in and you keep asking for more after finishing you first playthrough. You keep wondering \"what if I did this or that...\". I'm usually satisfied after completing a game once, but not with this one, since the choices you make matter a lot. You will want to load back, try other routes and see how the story will unravel. Don't be discouraged by the slow start (aka the Prologue), it may be a bit boring, but trust me - it gets a lot more interesting after you get to Flotsam.

This title takes place half a year later following the events of it's predecessor \"The Witcher\". After having saved King Foltest from an earlier assassination attempt, Geralt Of Rivia is this time unable to do so as Foltest is murdered right in front of him and Geralt takes the blame for his killing. As the powers that be decide that he's not truly guilty of this horrendous crime, The Witcher sets off on a quest across Temeria in search of the true culprit. A \"Kingslayer\" who is moving throughout the kingdom murdering monarchs everywhere and enciting chaos across the region. This title will take you on an expansive adventure across Temeria as \"The Butcher Of Blaviken\" aka Geralt Of Rivia searches for the person responsible for the regicides. \n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\n\nLike your typical R.P.G., Geralt earns experience points as he defeats enemies and completes various quests. Once you level up talent points are then accquired which you can apply to a number of attributes from swordmanship to alchemy and magic among others. Speaking of alchemy, it plays just as much of a part here as it did in the first game. A Witcher still concocts a number of potions and tonics to enhance their already substansial abilities but in this title you can also create very powerful mutagens from the parts of slain monsters. As for combat, like the previous title this games fighting system takes some getting used to but once you get a grasp of the techniques involved then it becomes truly enjoyable to play. You also have the option to use traps and bombs in your combat techniques alongside the powerful signs that a master Witcher employs with their swordplay. And for the occasional bout of street fisticuffs, there is also a terrific brawling system in place as well as dice poker and arm wrestling for a little fun on the side. \n\nUnlike the first title this game employs stealth mechanics to the gameplay. There are a number of times over the course of the story that Geralt will have to stay out of sight and sneak into as well as out of various places. Another great gameplay aspect are the decisions that you will have to make, some of them in mere seconds, over the course of the narrative. Just as in the first title many of these choices will have life and death as well as far reaching consequences for Temeria and Geralt so choose wisely. Also worthy of note is the massive codex in The Witcher 2: Assassins Of Kings Enhanced Edition. It contains a bevy of information on people, places, events, monsters and many other things pertaining to the lore of this amazing world. In short, this title takes the wonderful gameplay of the previous title and expands on it with many new features while wrapping that around a very compelling fantasy based narrative.\n\n[h1]VISUALS[/h1]\n\nThe visual presentation for this title is truly exceptional. Even today years after the games initial release it still maintains an impressive graphical style that alot of newly released titles to this day can't hold up to. The character models are gorgeous, wonderfully animated and always lifelike in their mannerisms and speech. The game has some great textures especially if you take advantage of the ultra graphics options available. Speaking of which, I particularly loved seeing all the different types of garb from lowly peasants to ironclad knights and highborn nobles. The variety of outfits and creative gear that you see demonstrated is quite impressive. The developers also made use of fantastic lighting as well as special effects like depth of field among many others. The time will cycle day to night and in towns you'll see people going about their daily business then retiring when it gets late. Also, stray animals like dogs, cats and chickens wander about. In short, Temeria just seems like a highly believable and immersive world to traverse during the time that you spend playing this wonderful title.\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\n\nOnce again CD PROJEKT RED manages to work their magic, pun totally intended, and deliver a truly enticing R.P.G. experience that successfully immerses you in a finely crafted highly believable fantasy world ripe with interesting lore and very memorable characters. Also, playing as Geralt in this game just makes you feel like a total BOSS!!! This title was an excellent continuation of the series and rightfully deserves all the awards and accolades that it won. Replayability is high due to the different decisions that you can make which actually affect people and events as well as the ending not to mention that one playthrough of this exceptional title is just not enough to take in all of the breathtaking visuals and cinematics in this game. As options go, The Witcher 2: Assassins Of Kings Enhanced Edition includes some additional adventures in other locations throughout Temeria, a digital comic book and the official soundtrack by Adam Skorupa and Krzysztof Wierzynkiewicz packed with 47 incredible tracks. In addition, there are an abundance of Steam Achievements to hunt down and Steam Trading Cards to collect as well. In conclusion, if you are a fan of the story-rich, adventure and fantasy genres of gaming then your library would be wholeheartedly incomplete without this exceptional title so The Witcher 2: Assassins Of Kings Enhanced Edition is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!", "timestamp_created": 1543749536, "timestamp_updated": 1543749536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.837155163288116455", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "4671807": {"recommendationid": "4671807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040603671", "num_games_owned": 953, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1334732400}, "language": "english", "review": "The Witcher 2 is one of the most mature, enthralling, entertaining games I've played in years.

(Pro Tips: DODGE! DODGE! DODGE!)\n- A developer who has managed to stay independent and still able to developed this great game\n- No DRM if you register the steam version on GOG.com for a backup copy for free!

My first exposure being the book, \u201cThe Last Wish\u201d by Andrzej Sapkowski. I started in on Witcher 1 after reading and found the mechanics slightly overbearing. Even with some background I found myself being overwhelmed by the vastness and seeming complexity of the mechanics brought fourth by what, to me, was a very cool prospect. Alchemy. \n\nThe idea behind it was not as its traditionally seen, even in fantasy. It wasn't some equal exchange of two completely unrelated things. Or when it was considered theoretical science, turning common metal into gold. It was poison, concocted from traditional alchemical ingredients. This poison would kill anyone not used to it. It took years and years of borderline torture to build this resistance. All in exchange for what was essentially, a high. Which in game mechanics turns into stat buffs and regen of various meters. AND on top of all this people were kidnapped before the age of five, trained in swordsmanship and forced to build a tolerance to the poisonous alchemical drinks. All to become \u201cthugs for hire\u201d and slay monsters. That, is the coolest shit ever. \n\nSadly I never completed the Witcher 1. Due to the overbearing nature. Suffice it to say. The Witcher 2 is a vast improvement. Mechanically, Narratively, and boy is she pretty. \n\nMy first play through I found some of that residual vastness to get to me. But I decided to forge ahead. I found myself understanding the times at which potions were needed and when they were not, even if most of time was due to trial and error. I am sort of an obsessive quick-saver. I found the dichotomy between Steel and Silver swords very real. Making the action feel much more tactical than your standard, run into that room and whack at stuff with a sharp stick. \n\nYou make decisions in this game like every other RPG. Only these choices are not so clear cut. There isn't really ever a clearly good or clearly bad option. Moral ambiguity at its best. Rather both sides seem to have very real unforeseen consequences. In fact in the mission \u201cAt a Crossroads\u201d, Literally 20+ hours of content lay behind a single choice. My second play through I had a lot more fun because I could focus less on worrying about how to spec or do I have enough ingredients for the potion I need. I was able to focus on the story and actually see some of the political tension much more clearly and take a stance that was well informed.  \n\nI love this world. Its probably the most fleshed out fantasy world I've gotten involved with. That's likely due to the fact that this game is based on a book series and not vice versa. Much in the way the Metro 2033 series is. \n\nNo prerequisite reading required to enjoy but it will definitely enhance the experience.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25764029/][i]Follow my curation for more[/i][/url]", "timestamp_created": 1418326747, "timestamp_updated": 1469397018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 121, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.854012250900268555", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34036205": {"recommendationid": "34036205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066331252", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508526033}, "language": "english", "review": "FInally i have finished playing The Witcher 2, such a great game, the graphics and combat system are absolutely stunning  compare with the previous one and the plot is fantastic.

Where TW1 was concerned with complex, morally grey characters in a folktale-fantasy setting; TW2 adjusts its focus toward worldly political plots submersed in magic, death, and general depravity. In essence the games share the same goal though - to further the story of Geralt and examine how he reacts to different dilemmas. The Witcher 2 takes an entirely different path to get there, which produces new strengths, but also new weaknesses. This revamped style works wonderfully in making Assassins of Kings utterly unique, and marks it as an experience to remember.\n\nIn The Witcher 2, you (as Geralt) start out as the glorified body guard of Foltest, King of Temeria, who\u2019s kept you around ever since you saved his life from an assassin in the first game. Events ensue quickly during the prologue, but you soon find yourself no longer in Foltest\u2019s services, and are instead thrust into a game of political intrigue, murder, and war - damning Geralt\u2019s idyllic belief in a Witcher\u2019s neutrality to hell. How you react to these circumstances is largely in your control, and the choices you must make are never easy.\n\nSwitching tone, graphically, The Witcher 2 looks exquisite. Textures are gritty and detailed, the lighting is dynamic and vibrant, and the combat animations are smooth and a spectacle to watch. The only visual flaw worth mentioning is the anti-aliasing, as it\u2019s fairly low quality. Altogether though, the graphics are very impressive. Along with that, the game performs decently, but definitely wouldn\u2019t win any awards for optimization. Crashes are fairly frequently and there are stutters when loading new areas, but it\u2019s not bad enough to jeopardize the experience. Overall the game has a great sense of [i]polish[/i] though, as there are few bugs, and it usually plays very smoothly.\n\nRemember when I said that this game wouldn\u2019t win any awards for optimization? Well, that\u2019s likely because The Witcher 2 is a port, and not a particularly good one. TW1 was a PC exclusive, but TW2 was made with (primarily) consoles in mind, which is why the load times, draw distance, UI, and various other technical elements are a bit wonky on PC. I\u2019m no PC elitist, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I weren\u2019t somewhat frustrated by the decentralization of The Witcher from the PC that occurred with the release of this title.\n\nTacking on one last element of the presentation, the music, while good, is less original than The Witcher 1 or 3. It doesn\u2019t have the folktale charm of the first game, or the epic orchestral scores of the third, and instead floats in this middle ground of generic fantasy with flecks of originality dispersed throughout the OST. It has some strokes of brilliance, but is usually just used to fill dead air.\n\nOne of the biggest changes since the original game is the modernized combat system. Gone is the semi-turn based, rhythmic clicking of TW1, which has been replaced by a real-time, streamlined system of various combat mechanics. There are now only strong and fast attack styles to use, as well as a roll and parry move for defense. The signs have been reworked as well, and are much more functional and useful in combat than before. The potion-brewing system has devolved however, as you can only take them outside of combat now, which means you barely ever use them because most fights are not telegraphed beforehand. The leveling system has been changed too, but mostly for the worse, as few perks are more than just mundane stat buffs. All in all the combat systems are much smoother and more skill intensive than before, but suffer from a lack of complexity that was once omnipresent.\n\nWhen it comes to the side quests you undertake as Geralt of Rivia in TW2, none are a cause for disappointment. There are always entertaining story threads running through quests, and worthwhile rewards for completing them. These quests range from monster contracts to murder investigations, and in the vast majority of them the undercurrent of player choice I mentioned earlier is highly emphasized. You\u2019ll oft find yourself having to choose from two opposing evils, decide which one is the lesser, and hope your decision doesn\u2019t haunt you afterwards - which it most certainly will.\n\nAnother stark contrast AoK has with its predecessor is that its game world is much more linear. TW1 was never open world but did have very open levels, while TW2, largely, has confined spaces for all three acts that it spans. The story itself feels more linear as well, as while there are several branching paths based off your decisions, the products of these choices commonly play out in well produced cut-scenes that require little to no input from the player. This style of guided world building and storytelling succeeds where the original game failed, but fails where it succeeded, which makes TW2 feel, thematically, very different. Whether or not this is good or bad, will come down to your personal opinion on elements of subtle linearity being put into RPG\u2019s.\n\nAs stated earlier, this game deals heavily with the politics of The Witcher, and as referenced by the subtitle; [i]Assassins of Kings[/i], this is a time of political strife. Two northern kings are assassinated in the first two hours of the game, and a large portion of the main quest is spent trying to find the assassin and discover who was really behind the assassinations, and their motives. Geralt struggles with his belief in his neutrality as a product of this, and in the end, it\u2019s impossible to stay entirely neutral. The shifting political landscape requires your attention, and your decisions will make or break people, organizations, and kingdoms, causing you to spurn some and satisfy others - creating an awesome atmosphere of consequence.\n\nLingering one last time on player choice, I really can\u2019t emphasize enough how many diverging paths there are to choose from. The Witcher 2 can legitimately be considered two whole games in one, as the second act of the game takes place in two separate locations based on a choice made in the first act, and there is little cross over in the content between these two places. I\u2019ve already talked about political and quest decision making, but you will also be forced to make decisions on what type of person Geralt is, such as the degree to which he wants to remain neutral, how much he cares for Triss, what his beliefs on the conflict between humans and the Scoia\u2019tael are, and so much more.\n\nIn terms of the books, The Witcher 2 chooses to reference occurrences in the historical lore more than events which personally effected Geralt or his friends. This does wonders for establishing the permanence of the world, but creates a slightly impersonal relationship between the player and the game\u2019s characters, which is something the first game excelled at. Human drama is still conveyed fittingly through the ever-present political drama found in TW2, but I miss the deep emotional and philosophical evaluations of characters that could be found in the first game. In the end this refocusing of objectives is handled well and makes sense, but feels less like The Witcher I know and love.\n\nTake my criticisms of The Witcher 2 with a grain of salt - as even I do. I judge it with such a critical eye because I adore the series, which includes this title as well. TW2 serves as a great set-up for the events of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and tells a riveting tale within itself. Though I enjoyed TW1 and TW3 more, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is still a magnificent experience, and given the competition within its own franchise, is as good as I could have possibly hoped it to be.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1468717536, "timestamp_updated": 1531252839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819912850856781006", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7978866": {"recommendationid": "7978866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028755888", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438297795}, "language": "english", "review": "If this game was a potato, it would be a good potato.", "timestamp_created": 1386565422, "timestamp_updated": 1386565422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2279, "votes_funny": 70, "weighted_vote_score": "0.868898272514343262", "comment_count": 72, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22093571": {"recommendationid": "22093571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034346697", "num_games_owned": 669, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420835864}, "language": "english", "review": "Now, really, can you say something bad about [i]Witcher[/i] games in general?

It's developed by Polish company CD Projekt Red.\n\nWitcher games are about monster hunter called Geralt of Rivia, also known as Butcher of Blaviken. Geralt has two objectives during the game, to regain his lost memory and find the Witcher who slayed the king, while being accused of killing the king himself. \n\nThe main story is intriguing and full of surprises. It highly varies based on your decision in the end of first chapter. Second and third chapters have different locations, characters and story focus depenging on your path. This gives Witcher 2 great replayability since different plot points will be revealed. Just like the main questline, side quests offer the same thoughtful and witty writing. There's morally ambigious choices throughout the game and you never know when the consequences come back at you. But very often they will.  \n\nThe negatives in the game would be the horrible Inventory system, it's a pain to navigate.No overwriting saves, so every save will be a new one and save folder can grow to even 5 gb. Too many saves also slows the launch menu and has been reported to sometimes even cause crashes. So I deleted my saves manually on occasion. I also wasn't a big fan of the combat changes. While the combat in first one was bit more tactical and rhythm based, now it feels a bit too button mashy. More tools to fight have been added though, like traps and throwing knives. I was also bothered that after killing an enemy, if there's another present, Geralt will automatically leap on the next one if you just keep on mashing the attack. Sometimes quite ridicilous distances. \n\nVoice acting is stellar and the music makes Geralt's journey feel even more epic. The game was gorgeous when it first came out. Still looks good even today, which makes it harder to run well on older machines. Personally I enjoyed the first game a bit more, because of the story and even the combat.

If somebody tells you that Witcher 2 is for mature audiences, this isn\u2019t because it\u2019s exceptionally bloody or gory for a title of its genre \u2013 it\u2019s because of the world and stories that it presents.\n\nIt\u2019s true: the graphics are mostly really good, even stunning in places. Battle is tactical and you have to learn how to use both your weaponry and your magic abilities in order to succeed. Music and sound are pretty good - the nice use of different dialects is a good reason that you should consider playing it in English even if that\u2019s not your native language. The flaws that actually bothered me were few - like the fact that Geralt (your character) puts up the same facial expression for 80% of his dialogue. \n\nYet it\u2019s the storytelling and the way you shape WHAT story unfolds that I enjoyed most.\nGeralt has a real talent to end up as the \u201cright guy in the wrong place\u201d. And even though he progresses through the quests for pretty personal reasons, he constantly finds himself forced to make decisions that have a much larger impact than his personal fate.  Who will you trust? Who will you help? By the time you finish the first chapter you will have made decisions that will not only control the way you experience the rest of the story, but also will shape the lifes of many of the characters you met and \u2013 in the end \u2013 maybe even the rise and the fall of the nations that you cross. As usual in the Witcher games, you will find that not all of your decisions have the effect that you hoped, and often you only can try to choose the lesser evil. \n\nWhen I finished the game I felt the urge to play the Witcher 3  (which isn\u2019t released at the time of this writing). Not because of the (hopefully) good gameplay and graphics that I expect \u2013 but because I wonder where Geralt's personal story and the big events that happen around him will finally lead.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, get past the crappy tutorial and average prologue and then \u2013 starting with the first chapter - play one of the finest RPGs that are out there.", "timestamp_created": 1408307903, "timestamp_updated": 1408310429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.781930506229400635", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42720321": {"recommendationid": "42720321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151736276", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1528914154}, "language": "english", "review": "Had sex with Triss.

Unlike the previous game, I went into this one knowing that I'd probably have a good time, and I'm glad that turned out to be true.\n\nClocking in at a little over 35 hours, the Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is a little shorter than the first game, even when you complete most of the content on offer. However, this game also doesn't feature as much back and forth between locations as the first one, which is a welcome change. It's still present, some quests even have generous amounts of walking between two characters in a city just to make progress in a quest, but for the most part, quests have been streamlined in that regard. Streamlined, that's a word that could be used to describe this game when comparing it to its predecessor. Some would go as far as to say it has been brutally [i]\"consolized\"[/i], but I disagree. In fact, I believe it has, in many ways, helped shape this game into a small masterpiece that oozes talent, passion and love from its dev team.\n\nFirst off, the obvious: This game is downright gorgeous. CD Projekt RED built an entirely new engine for the Witcher 2, and it is a huge improvement on the old Aurora engine they licensed from Bioware for the first Witcher. The trade off for having incredible visuals is that the game has a lot of small buffer zones to camouflage its loading times. To go from Flotsam into the forest, you have to traverse a small area along the walls with two doors that you have to open manually. The same goes for the transition from the Kaedweni camp into the grassy area around it. Vergen has you going through a small corridor before reaching the outside world, and so on. It's no big deal and I'll take this over long loading screens any day, but once you notice it, you'll never be able to ignore it again.\n\nPresentation as a whole has been improved, with a more discrete, less invasive but still tasteful HUD, the menus could be more snappy especially when loading saves but other than that they're fine, character models look superb even if the game sometimes goes too far with the bloom, making faces look weird, and conversations in general are more entertaining, even allowing for the use of signs or intimidation to convince someone. They did however reduce dialog options to just a few words that often don't even represent what your character is going to say, the same thing I blasted Fallout 4 for many times. I really hope this is changed in the third game.\n\nCombat has been improved a LOT, going from [i]\"click on your enemy repeatedly, sometimes change your style depending on what enemy you're facing, and spam 360\u00b0 Igni\"[/i] to a system that's somewhat reminescent of Dark Souls at times, with rolls, parries and ripostes, and enemies that pose an actual threat. I also found myself using all the signs at regular intervals, and even potions became a necessity at times, especially while replaying the game on its higher difficulties. It's much more engaging and also feels very rewarding when you learn how to deal with enemies that used to give you a lot of trouble.\n\nSide activites have been expanded to include fist fighting matches and arm wrestling in addition to the returning dice poker. The fist fighting mostly boils down to hitting keys or buttons at the right time, I don't think I ever lost a single match. Arm wrestling has you keeping a circle in a moving bar, which can go wrong and is therefore more engaging, and dice poker is even more luck based than in the first one. These activities can help you earn money but you can never wager much so it still takes ages. Luckily there's mods to increase the max amount of money you can put on the table. The mod support for this games is quite decent and the nexus has many interesting tweaks for players who are looking for a slightly altered experience.\n\nWriting...characters are definitely more interesting and layered than they were in the first game, which was already pretty good at this, but the improved presentation and character models helps taking them seriously now. The overall plot however is not as straightforward as it could be. Even having played the first game and spent an unhealthy amount of time in the lore sections, I still had to print out a map of the world to be sure I knew where exactly countries are in relation to each other. It kind of hurts the enjoyment of a game that's otherwise great at providing entertaining character interactions, quality humor and choices that make you stop and and think, not to mention a huge decision at the end of chapter 1 that literally changes the entirety of chapter 2 and some parts of chapter 3.\n\nSoundtrack and sound design are also an improvement over the first game, making fights more epic and visceral, sad scenes more impactful, all that good stuff. The game offers a lot of replayability. After my first run, I liked it so much that I decided to get all the achievements, so I restarted the game on Dark difficulty, took the alternate path at the end of chapter 1 and discovered a whole new game. And my third playthrough on Insane difficulty also led to some quests I'd never seen before. No section of the game was too tedious to replay, which is a good sign if you ask me.\n\nIn conclusion, the Witcher 2 offers a more accessible but not necessarily worse experience than the first game. I prefer the story of the first Witcher, but that aside, pretty much everything else has been improved, from the combat to the visuals, soundtrack, character interactions and quests. I very much recommend playing this game if you like action RPGs, and it's also a great occasion to get into the Witcher series.", "timestamp_created": 1507499602, "timestamp_updated": 1507499602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768520534038543701", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40733764": {"recommendationid": "40733764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198248645186", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1540491612}, "language": "english", "review": "YRDEN, TRAP IT WITH THE YRDEN", "timestamp_created": 1520753413, "timestamp_updated": 1520753508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 48, "weighted_vote_score": "0.779335260391235352", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39909404": {"recommendationid": "39909404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089052394", "num_games_owned": 1106, "num_reviews": 181, "playtime_forever": 1524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516670282}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b]The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition\t\t* 8/10[/b][/h1]\n\nA sequel that takes the aesthetic and graphic to the next level, improves gameplay by adopting a more common and comfortable combat system yet keeping all the alchemy and crafting aspects. Many choices to make but the story doesn't deliver the level of epicness of the first chapter giving the impression of a transition chapter that prepares the player for the third chapter.\n\n[h1][i]INTRO. What is The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings about?[/i][/h1]\n\nThere's a Witcher around the Northern realms that has killed King Demavend of Aedirn and all his knights. Geralt's story begins in the most charming way, with Geralt imprisoned and talking to Vernon Roche, a special guard loyal to Foltest, rebuilding the events that lead to the present time, starting with the investigation of the othe witcher that attempted at King Foltest's life and proceeding with the La Valettes' castle siege.\n\nNo more can be said to prevent spoilers as the reconstruction ends with a shocking and touching event that will mark the beginning of Geralt's new adventure (yes, this was just the prologue. Very long and intriguing indeed).\n\nWhy the severe judgment about the story? It's not a simple matter of being good or bad.\nThe Witcher 2 follows a very good written story with incredibly and amazing cutscenes, again many choices, and lots of different endings (also few endings differ in minor changes only). But it doesn't match its predecessor. In my opinion I feel like the story in general is more studied and bigger than the first witcher, more interesting to follow and play (contrarily to the first witcher), but fails with reflecting the player's choices where the first witcher succeeded and fails with the escalation of epicness with the epilogue where the first witcher succeeded as well.\nIn other words The Witcher 2 has a very good story, but doesn't reach the immense peak of its predecessor, making it look like a chapter made for the sole purpose of linking the first and third game.\n\n[h1][i]GRAPHIC. Engine And Artistic aspects.[/i][/h1]\nAstonishing. A huge leap forward compared to the first title. CD Projekt Red developed their own Engine, REDengine, and it really shows marvels. Incredible vast environments, lightings and great characters details. It runs great on my GTX 1060 unless you activate the Ubersampling option, which definitely kills performace even on my rig, without sensible graphic improvements.\nMany big worlds have been created with an immense care for details, as usual full of life, with peasants, animals, or even remains and corpses if we're visiting mines or crypts.\nJust one thing. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it was my impressions but I have the slight feeling colors are a bit oversaurated. I don't know...\n\n[h1][i]SOUNDTRACK. Themes and Accompaniments.[/i][/h1]\nMusic includes a really good score, with melodic movements and more action oriented tracks, as usual. It has a good variety of tracks and doesn't repeat itself too much.\nOnce again during dialogues thre are few volume differences here and there, but less than the first title, so nothing too annoying.\n\n[h1][i]GAMEPLAY. How does it work?[/i][/h1]\nThere are many interesting aspects and mechanics about the game and a nwbie could easily get lost, however there's a good tutorial that covers all the necessasry to understand the game.\nHowever, mostly like the first Title, The witcher 2 is has RPG elements, so gain experience with quests and killings, and improve your stats. However this time stats are ruled by a skill tree with 4 branches, a base one, swordfight, alchemy, and signs. Your inventory can be filled with elements to brew potions, oils or bombs, as in the first title; you can find more armors and swords, you can craft them as long as you find the recipes, and so on.\nWhat totally changed is the combat system. You still have your signs that still are the only kind of magic you can use, but this time sword fighting has adopted a classic action approach with two styles only, normal and heavy strikes.\nI've found this change easier to approach and begin with but personally I've missed the 3rd group sword style from the first title as you will find yourself surrounded by monsters or enemies in more occasions. Sure, one of the abilities from the Swordfight branch of the skill tree allows some group damage to surrounding enemies but it has a limited area of impact.\nAlso animatons are good, but in the first witcher that silver blade was really swinging all the way with much more style! XD\nThis time missions wil have a bit more variety, both main quests and secondary ones. There wil be curses to lift, investigations to do, ambiguous dialogues with deceiving characters that will force you to never trust anyone and so on.\n\n[h1][i]LAST NOTES. What doesn't work?[/i][/h1]\nNothing. One can get used to new alchemic and meditation systems, also the new combat style is easier to learn and use. Story is very good, side missions are interesting, choices are important. In my opinion the only bad note about the Witcher 2 is that it doesn't get to the levels of the first Title in terms of story and choices, and this makes the game less memorable, even though it's well worth playing.\n\n[h1][i]TL;DR. Pros And Cons[/i][/h1]\n[h1]+++PROs+++[/h1][list]\n[*][b] EVOLUTION.[/b] This second chapter represent an immense evolution in almost all aspects. Engine is awesome even nowadays, locations are crafted with a lot of care, soundtrack is very good, story, cutscenes, dialogues and choices are well written, gameplay is more approachable than the first title.\n[/list]\n[h1]---CONs---[/h1][list]\n[*][b] NOT THE FIRST.[/b] This second chapter is very good and worth playing.

While doing so, he is mixed up in politics, treason and unraveling conspiracies throughout his way.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is, that the graphics improved quite a lot, compared to it's predecessor.\nSharp textures, lush colors and a great attention to detail will please your eyes. Though, when it comes to post-processing effects, they might have been a bit too generous. Sometimes the colors, the Bloom etc. can be a bit distracting and blinding, though that doesn't take away from it's beauty.\n\nThe second big improvement is the combat. While it is still kind of a click-combo way to fight, it's way less clunky and feels more natural and direct. You shouldn't have big issues getting the hang out of it.\nYou still have 2 swords to chose from, one silver and the other a steel one, while being able to do a light or heavy attack.\n\nThe characters and story are, again, the highlights of the game. It's not just the main story that's captivating and motivating you to push on, but also side-quests that are funny and or interesting.\nWaking up on the beach with a hangover, naked and being tattooed on your neck and then finding out what happened is one of those quests (keeping the tattoo and importing your save-file to the Witcher 3 will let you keep the tattoo; great attention to detail and continuity).\n\nThe one thing that might be a bit overwhelming and confusing could be the political part of the game. Especially in the beginning, but also in parts throughout the game, you're faced with a lot of different characters, kingdoms and it's kings, the political situation of the world etc.\nKnowing the books the game is based on, i didn't had any issues following it, though if you're not familiar with it, it might be a bit much.\n\nAnd again you are faced with choices and this time there is one big choice which will decide which area you will visit from chapter 2 onwards. So replaying the game and choosing a different side will open up a whole new area, new quests, new characters to meet and a whole new perspective on the story and motives of the characters.\n\nThankfully for me, i didn't faced any technical issues, bugs or crashes, so i can't comment on any of these.\nHowever, i know that when using the german language, it crashed in the past and you had to replace the umlauts (google should help with that). Remembering this, i replaced those from the beginning and wasn't plagued by any issues.\n\nGreat part 2 of the series and definitely recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1504084528, "timestamp_updated": 1505810612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.78856194019317627", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35137797": {"recommendationid": "35137797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025488540", "num_games_owned": 731, "num_reviews": 110, "playtime_forever": 1878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506452650}, "language": "english", "review": "It's very rare to play an RPG that does not feature a globe trotting, world saving, massive journey taking main character--And it's even rarer to do that [i]twice[/i]. Yet here we are with CDPR's incredibly crafted sequel to the legendary Witcher 1, and they have absolutely captured lightning in a bottle once again. Following the events of the previous installment's ending, players find themselves assuming the role of Geralt of Rivia once more as he's tasked with ensuring King Faltest's safety during a major battle to regain heirs to the throne. When an assassin catches the witcher off guard and commits regicide, Geralt sets off on a quest with Dandelion, Triss, Zoltan, and newcomer Roche to capture the kingslayer and the witcher's name. Throughout the three chapters within the Witcher 2, players will encounter sorceresses who are not what they seem, great beasts intent on killing everything in their path, kings who see the witcher as a pawn to do their bidding, and a troll that gets drunk and ignores his bridge duties, among other things.\n\nWhile the Witcher 1's combat was generally regarded as clunky but servicable, the Witcher 2's combat greatly innovates the concept and improves in nearly every single way. The gameplay could possibly be regarded as a hack and slash, but you absolutely won't get away with simply diving into battle and swinging with wild abandon, lest you want to load your save fifty times in a row--players must tactically dodge, roll, and parry with every strike and use all available resources in order to survive. This simply isn't like previous game in which the player can skirt by without ever coating their blade in oil or drinking only Swallows--the Witcher 2 will kick your ass with its difficulty.\n\nStorywise, the Witcher 2 is stronger than ever. The mature themes and writing the Witcher series is known for continue to pervade throughout this sequel, with gritty realism and bleakness factoring into the story's plots and subplots. Choices have to be made, and these choices are never good versus evil, but rather the lesser of two evils or a mixture of gray scaled justice and consequence. Choices you made in the Witcher 1 will come back to bite you or remind you of just who you are, and choices you make here will reveal after effects--some soon, some later. Everything matters.\n\nAs for a few short remarks, the music is almost as excellent as the first series' entry, though perhaps not as memorable. The voice acting is leagues ahead of the Witcher 1 as well as the characters' models themselves. Indeed, the graphics and art style of the Witcher 2 look [i]intensely[/i] beautiful, and I can only imagine what the Witcher 3 will look like.\n\nOverall, just like its predecessor, the Witcher 2 is an excellent CRPG with a few minor flaws, but otherwise is near perfection in gameplay, story telling, and building a breathing, believable world where the stakes are high and the choices have impact. If you are questioning whether or not you should start your Witcher journey, I wholeheartedly recommend you begin with the Witcher 1 and then make your way here.

While it certainly helps to have strong material to reference, CDPR takes author Andrzej Sapkowski creation - Geralt of Rivia - and wholly makes him their own. Having played [b][i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i][/b] first before tackling the series from the very beginning, I was sometimes confused by the history shared between Geralt and its enormous cast of main and supporting charactors. Having gone back and played the first two in succession has certainly helped broaden my understanding of the relationships Geralt shares with each character, the lore and the complexity of the world that has been created by author Andrzej Sapkowski. [b][i]The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings[/i][/b] does suffer a bit from character overload though. Unless you are playing the game 24/7, day in day out without taking breaks it becomes very easy to lose track of who is who in the zoo and even though the game provides you with a glossary that constantly updates it is rather messy and not as clean as I would have liked it. The games graphics are still gorgeous. Considering I played this in 2018, it is hard to believe that the game came out in 2011 and while the combat is still a bit clunky and the inventory is a complete mess of a design, it's definitely not as rough around the edges as the original. In fact I was surprised how much [b][i]The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings[/i][/b] reminded me of [b][i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i][/b], more so than the first game in the series. [b][i]The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings[/i][/b] is everything a sequel should be by improving on almost every aspect of the original and if you enjoy exploring fantasy worlds layered with a strong and complex narrative backbones then this game is for you.

To be reductive, it contains a lot of action-like RPG combat and deep mechanics common to Bethesda games, but is also extremely narrative driven to the tune of something Bioware might put out.  Over the course of the game, much of the Witcher's many turning gears become an immensely enjoyable machine, though it jumps to a rough start and could use a more enjoyable combat system.  I did play with the Combat Rebalance mod, which allegedly makes the combat better; truly I think it just made it more trivial, but those may be two sides of the same coin in this case.\n\nI started Witcher 2 having never played the Witcher 1, and generally not knowing what the game was about or how it worked.  Let me be blunt -- that is the absolute worst way to start the Witcher 2.  The game does offer an overall useless tutorial (if you have the Enhanced Edition), but otherwise it throws you right into a pretty hot mess.  Very little is explained in the way of combat mechanics, the many systems at your control (things like potions, crafting, magic abilities), and the context of the warring monarchs and their mysterious assassin which are central to its plotline.  Overall, it\u2019s a little daunting to start.  That said, I highly recommend you persevere; lying on the other side is a huge payoff.\n\nWhat makes Witcher 2 shine is the well crafted, incredibly epic story of politicking and sorcery.  What\u2019s even more impressive is the dynamic way in which it is presented to you; very few games give you the sense of control over the story the way Witcher does.  The game is divided into 3 acts, and the second act can be completely different based on decisions you make in the first act.  You will start in a different location, have different characters to interact with, and different quests.  Even more impressive is that Witcher 2 does a good job of staying away from the typical good/bad archetypes; characters usually feel complex and your decisions almost always fall into a gray area.  It never feels like the game is pushing you one direction or the other; sometimes being the bad guy pays off...other times, not so much.  \n\nThe plot itself is very interesting, though you won\u2019t find anything revolutionary about it.  Voice acting is typically well done, which is good because there is a LOT of it.  At least half the game can easily be spent talking to characters and fleshing out the world in which Witcher 2 takes place.  Cutscenes are serviceable, but nothing extraordinary.  Like many games of this scope, much of the Witcher 2 lacks a certain polish -- the game certainly looks beautiful, but animations are often clunky and transitions are not done well.\n\nLacking the most polish, certainly, is the combat.  Combat in Witcher 2 feels mostly like a buffer between unlocking more of the story.  With the Combat Rebalance mod, parrying is automatic and after some initial struggle, I quickly learned to spam the same ability over and over again, accented by mashing attack and rolling around.  I easily beat 95% of encounters this way.  While you have a lot of options in terms of equipment etc., the majority is useless or unnecessary and I would have liked a little more variety in loot and spells.  I wouldn\u2019t say the combat is outright bad, but it is certainly mediocre and not the highlight here.\n\nOverall, while there is a lot to nitpick about Witcher 2, I highly enjoyed it.  It\u2019s a beautiful game which offers up one of the most interesting stories you can find in the medium.  Decisions are impactful and rewarding, even if combat is not.  If you like Skyrim, or Mass Effect, and wish there was a game which blended the two together into a great PC game, look no further than Witcher 2.", "timestamp_created": 1413228989, "timestamp_updated": 1413246510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 72, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.796785473823547363", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9137775": {"recommendationid": "9137775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029267869", "num_games_owned": 2498, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1374520561}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily one of the best PC games released in the latest years. Easily one of the best surprises, too - you will see more passion and talent from those 'noobs' from Poland than you would in most of the AAA studios, combined. The sheer idea to be a rather indie studio and create a game like this, polish it (word origin nudges me weirdly here) and bring it to the extent it is available today, is remarkable and admiring.\n\nI have spent countless hours in the summer of 2011 playing and replaying the game. Because you don't get one strict and direct walkthrough; in fact, you can play 2 completely different storylines and make choices that will result in 16 (!) different endings. Mind you, I haven't seen them all (yet), but some craze at some point in the future might make me want to do so.\n\nWitcher 2 is an action-adventure RPG - you will see a lot of combat, and the combat mechanics will matter when you face tougher foes. You need a strategy to survive - button mashing won't help you. You can master either of the 3 skill paths - Magic, Alchemy and Swordmanship and use your signs, potions and gear in order to kick every monster and merc's a** in the beautiful world of Witcher 2.\n\nSpeaking of beauty, as long as you have a powerful enough PC to push the game hard, you can't fail to notice how lovely it is made - the whole world looks like it is living and breathing, with NPCs having their own business throughout the day and sleep at night, lights, shadows and colours that make it all look hell pretty - the game might be 2011, but it still easily competes with some weaker attempts from more recent times.\n\nEverything in this game screams for maturity - from the portrayal of the storyline to some rather odd moments in the game - you might think nudity is not appropriate for games, but if you are old enough to think about it normally, you'll see there's nothing bad in a beautiful love scene like in any other movie. And indeed, the fantasy world of Witcher 2 is not a fantasy world meant for putting kids to sleep - it can easily be described as an alternative Middle Ages where humans have all their present strong and weak qualities, and the legends about the monsters lurking outside of the village at night turn out to actually be there for real.\n\nComparing it to the first installment of the series, I would say I prefer Witcher 2 over it's predecessor, even though I wouldn't deny it either. Everything looks better thought of and finished in the follow-up, but the truth is, the Witcher 1 forged the path for the developers to get together and release a game like this. If you wonder, definitely play the first one first, but come back here when you've finished it.\n\nIf you are at least a tiny little bit fan of books, don't think twice and grab yourself a copy of the Witcher stories- Andrzej Sapkowski is the mastermind of this world (book came first, then the game). Stories are not necessarily strictly connected between the books and the game, they are loosely situated in the same world, with the main protagonist being the white-haired cold-blooded and serious monster killer Geralt of Rivia. Who, by the way, is already one of my most favourite characters overall.\n\nIn a few words - if you don't have the game yet and you are a fan of RPG, deep and mature stories and beautiful graphics: get it, get it now.\n\n\n\nP.S. Devs are real nowadays heroes as they release a ton of free downloadable content and updates AFTER the game is released. Yep, you get all those DLCs you pay for in the other games for free - and they added the Enhanced edition for free for all early purchasers too. They are also known for bashing the mandatory nowadays DRM too - if you buy the game retail, you just need the disc to play it. Like in the good old days.\n\nP.S. 2 I own the retail Collector's Edition of the game and I just had to buy it again on Steam. I don't mind it at all, I would put my money for those guys any day, as long as they keep releasing games like this (blink blink: Witcher 3; blink blink: Cyberpunk).", "timestamp_created": 1392553133, "timestamp_updated": 1392553499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 164, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.834816634654998779", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10486310": {"recommendationid": "10486310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011388211", "num_games_owned": 456, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 2733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403096128}, "language": "english", "review": "Reviewing the first game of The Witcher Saga I remember writing \"this is a badass RPG\"... well, this second installment is at least ten times better.

Graphics-wise the game is just wonderful, it seems impossible that it was released in 2011. The story is compelling and full of humour, intrigues and plot twists, and since you'll have to choose between two possible paths at the end of Act I, you need AT LEAST two different playthroughs to explore all the content (but to really see everything you'll probably need to reload your savegame at least 4 or 5 times in certain situations). \n\nI cannot think about a single reason not to try this game, especially if you're a RPG aficionado.

Be aware that by the time you've finished this game, your parents will most likely at least once try to talk you into not watching porn and you will have perfected the Art of igniting Torches. Useless you say? I've heard that it can be put to great use in the next sequel so do be proud of yourself.\n\nAnyway, past the introduction, the story in TW2 continues with Geralt trying to connect the missing pieces of his past in an even darker and more mature sequel. One of the first things the player will notice is the vast improvement in graphics compared to TW1 and the fact that the whole story takes a more political and character-manipulating approach with more dialogues and character interactions compared to the first, all played briliantly throughout the game without disturbing its flow or requiring you to read anything and also in beatifully made cinematics. That being said, voice-acting is excellent in this game. \n\nYou will never feel like an unearthly superhuman who descended upon Earth to lay waste and conquer the realms, something that many other RPGs turn their protagonist into. Instead here in TW2, you will start low, in a cell under interrogation, discriminated because of your race, open to manipulation and lies thanks to your Amnesia syndrom, abused through temptation and charm from cunning and ambitious women who will lie to you and have you do their bidding... or at least try to. This game tries to take a more realistic approach than many others, but doesn't always succeed in it. You will understand once you get to the sex scenes...\n\nIn visual terms and system resources, the game is incredibly well optimized, easily reaching Ultra graphics with stunning results in even medium to top tier GPUs. Sure it might be a 2011 game, but when you've played games like GTA4 who can't even handle Shadows while driving or DOS1-EE which froze every few seconds on 120+ FPS or even Just Cause 2 which crashed every 5 minutes, then you will realize what I'm talking about. This game never laged or crashed on me.\n\nThis is one of the games that outright shines in story, plot, graphics and immersion. The sounds, the characters, the backstabbings, the betrayals, the romance and the mystery behind the Witcher will keep every RPG fan and those of the series entertained. I found the cinematics in TW2 to be one of the best so far in all my RPG games played, easily compared to those of the KH series. Outright fascinating! \n\nBut now It's time to mention the negative parts of the game. TW2 has one of the worst UI and visual alerts I've seen, making it MANDATORY to use Mods which remove the Capacity and Weight limit, the pointless cooldown of your pendant and optionaly remove the limited Ability Points and let Geralt unlock his maximum potential. Potions during battle, just like in TW1 was for me also a must-have mod for a first playthrough. You can not possibly expect to know what kind of monsters you will face next, unless you've played the game before.\n There are also mods which improve the Combat, which was unfortunately poorly made. Even in Medium difficulty, I found out that spamming and maxing Quen and slashing my way through was enough to beat the entire game. \n \nSpeaking about terrible UI and character movement, rest assured that you are not the only one who didn't manage to loot every Crate in the game (yes the ones stuck in the corner behind a bed or other crates) or that your Camera simply denies you from looting a particular crate or sack lying on the floor. And then we have the Pendant which you have to spam every 3 seconds (with the Mod) to loot all those plants and barrels and find the random sources of power placed in ridiculous places with zero clue given to you.\n And of course... the torches! Holy shit that was a top-class player trolling with all this torch-next-to-NPC and torch next to important interractable object farce! This isn't Master Geralt, this is freaking Master Torch-Igniter! \n\nThen we have the Map and the Backtracking. Oh, how many times I got lost in the Dwarf city trying to find said NPC or I had to return to the very end of the dungeon, because killing the end-boss triggered a cutscene which then spawned me somewhere else afterwards, leaving me unable to loot anything in the last dungeon area. \n This is a big issue I found in TW2, it's lack of freedom. The story forces you down on a number of Chapters and locks-out uncompleted quests after each Chapter. Quests which without an external guide are sometimes impossible to solve. I have missed a various quests during my playthrough, but sadly there weren't all that many in the first place. \n \nAnd then you have to pick a race to support mid-game, meaning you lose all other quests, events, sex scenes and story of the unchosen path. Yes, I know that second playthroughs are a thing, but trust me, few players will replay the entire game only to view the differences in a single Chapter which is also in the middle-end of the game. \n But to be fair, there are a few universal quests which were fantastic and memorable, my favourite being \"The Secrets of Loc Muinne\".\n\nGenerally, compared to TW1, the sequel improved considerably on some points (Graphics, Story, Cinematics, the Journal, the voice-acting), but has worsened in other aspects, like the Combat, the Alchemy and the Potions, the Freedom of choice and quests, the game length, the UI, the unclear instructions especially during boss fights and the visual alerts which were terrible at times. \n\nStill this is an above average game, sadly not as good as The Witcher 1, but a game I would easily consider \"Good\". Do not expect to find your joy through the Combat or the Gameplay, but instead try turning down the difficulty to Easy or Medium and enjoy the Story, the Quests and the Cinematics which will not disappoint you.\nValue for your bucks?

'Assassins of Kings' takes place after the events of the first game and throws the player into a dark, cruel and mature fantasy world full of morally ambigious (but nonetheless remarkable) characters, political disputes and an insane amount of names, lore and history. \n__________________________________________ \n\n[h1]The journey of a Witcher...[/h1]\n\nThe game's story is amazing and full of twists and remarkable events that will entertain you for a long time. Main and sidequests are very well written, diversified and more than just once the player has to make decisions where the difference between 'good' and 'bad' isn't that obvious. Geralt's journey will bring him to different cities, realms and areas and there are many things to do for the White Wolf. Sure it's no 'Open World'-game but the locations still offer huge areas to explore, that are full of monsters, characters, hidden secrets and forgotten treasures. Besides the synchronisation is all the time on a high level (even in german!) and despite its age of over four years the visuals are still absolutely gorgeous. \n\nI have spent over 40 hours on my first run on hard mode but afterwards I instantly started a second one due to the fact that the choices you make can create completely different adventures and often questlines, areas and outcomes change entirely. So far I've played it for over 70 hours and I've never been bored. \n__________________________________________ \n\n[h1]Contra[/h1]\n\nSure the game isn't perfect. Some negative points would be that the difficulty changes between 'Geralt is Superman' and 'everyone else is Superman' (which leads to some pretty annoying situations), the fighting system is just average (...and definitly not a very strong point here), I had several CTDs and unfortunately the saving system is kind of annoying, because every save creates a new seperate data and the more data the longer some loading periods will be. As a 'frequent-saver' I had to clean out a lot...\n__________________________________________ \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\n...but this is complaining on a very high level and all in all I can say that this is one of my favourite RPGs. It provides an amazing storyline with great lore and characters in a morally ambigious dark fantasy world that's far away from your typical stereotypes. And all this is backed up by one of the best protagonists of all time: the legendary white wolf, Geralt of Rivia. \n\nEvery RPG-fan who skips this game will definitely miss something! \n(...and if only because you can import your finished savegame to the Witcher III).", "timestamp_created": 1436475254, "timestamp_updated": 1484735203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 98, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.808437526226043701", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39345355": {"recommendationid": "39345355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049020554", "num_games_owned": 3227, "num_reviews": 256, "playtime_forever": 1937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515916663}, "language": "english", "review": "The Witcher 2 takes place after the Witcher 1, with Geralt being the main character again. This time the story revolves around a kingslayer and the \"assassins of kings\" with a massive plot unfolding setting the seeds for the North and Witcher 3.\n\nIf you are considering playing this before Witcher 3, I would do it. You don't really need to play Witcher 1, but Witcher 2 is a short but relatively impactful story. In fact, the game is actually really short as there are only 3 acts, and act 3 is like two or three big quests in total. One very interesting and awesome thing that Witcher 2 did was add replay value. Starting from the prologue, you can start making choices that affect the end game. One significant choice (Roche vs. Iorveth) actually impacts the game significantly in act 2, with pretty much most of act 2 being different based off of who you sided with. After you side with one of the other, there are still options after as to who to help. According the the Wiki, there are actually 16 endings to the game! Leave it to CD Projekt Red to pull something amazing off like this.\n\nThe gameplay has changed quite a bit in Witcher 2 compared to Witcher 1. No longer do you have to carefully chain your attacks by clicking at the right time. The graphics have vastly improved, and the combat is more about hitting and dodging as well as carefully planning out in advance with traps and signs. Basically the game is a complete overhaul of the graphics and combat in Witcher 1, but tried to keep some similar parts. There are still 5 signs to choose from as well as potions, traps, bombs. Meditation in the game became quite a bit more convenient as you can now meditate almost anywhere. Another major improvement is that not all the side characters have the same exact model as they did in Witcher 1, and the voice acting in Witcher 2 is actually really great.\n\nThe bad parts of the game are still some things that carry over from Witcher 1. There are still quite a few invisible walls and limited fields of movement. This is supplemented by the fact that there is no jump button. However, you get used to these flaws relatively fast. Another thing I personally disliked was that some keys were permanently bound together. I would have liked my interact button to be E, but that was bound together with left click attack button already permanently. However, these flaws weren't that major and surely weren't anywhere close to game breaking.\n\nAside from the minor flaws, the Witcher 2 is a great. but short game that serves as a prelude for the events in Witcher 3.\n\nRating: 8.9/10\nRecommend Price: $9.99 (but you can always find this game for cheaper on sales)", "timestamp_created": 1515954029, "timestamp_updated": 1515954029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714073836803436279", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11340459": {"recommendationid": "11340459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003476696", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 2883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1405903985}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply the best adult, fantasy, rpg, i've ever played.

I loved the first game, and I couldn't wait to see the continuation of Geralt's story. The second game was such a far cry from the first one, that I actually had to step away from it for a few weeks to readjust myself to the incredible changes of look and gameplay. When I came back to it, I got caught up in a very beautiful and complicated story.\n\nThe game is beautiful. It could be described as one giant screenshot. I played the game on Medium specs, and wondered how it could possibly get any better. But than again, I''m pretty new to this type of quality in gaming. Up until 5 months ago, I was still playing on a Playstation 2, so there you go... So yes, it is very pretty, sounds pretty, awesome characters, you need to do all the side quests because they all are necessary blah blah blah. We know all that already. Let's get nitpicky or this will be just another review saying that this is the second part of a trilogy leading to the greatest game of all time forever...\n\nNow, the story is very very very political. In comparison to the first game, it felt more like a historical drama that just happens to take place in a sort of fantasy Eastern European setting. You may have to constantly check your journal to refresh yourself on all the characters and who is in what faction and the kingdom's leaders so you choose the side you want to join, and possibly end up backstabbing anyways because the world of The Witcher is.....so.....complicated. At the end of the game, Geralt says,\"I'm tired of choosing the lesser evil.\" I was right there with him. This game is not about right or wrong. It is all about ethics. This game really does right the game mechanic or not having a clear cut right/wrong answer. There are only consequences.\n\nThe world is beautiful but finding your way around it is horribly confusing. The world map is very hard to read as far as knowing where exactly you want to go. It is very small. Also, it does not help with the circular mini map that is on screen. I never had a problem navigating in The Witcher. As much as I enjoyed exploring the world, I wish navigating it had been less complicated. \n\nThe combat system is very different from the first game. It took a lot of getting used to for me since I loved the combat in the first game. I had to play the game on Easy to get a handle on it. I do intend to go back and replay it again on Normal. The idea that Geralt has to drink potions before battle is annoying and understandable at the same time. Boss battles are easy to prep for, while other times you want to drink a potion in the heat of battle that you didn't see coming but you can't because you are in the heat of battle!\n\nThis game was very enjoyable. It takes huge leaps forward in terms of how it looks, while the combat system may be a turn off to those who enjoyed the first game. As much as I enjoyed it, I would say to those that play the The Witcher FIRST, take a few days/weeks off of the series to clear your fingers and eyes mindset.", "timestamp_created": 1500071811, "timestamp_updated": 1500072137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.74062657356262207", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23405735": {"recommendationid": "23405735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034632861", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464718039}, "language": "english", "review": "I only played it to get a better understanding of the witcher universe before starting on Witcher 3.\n\nOverall \nGraphics - 8/10 Pretty good for a game that came out in 2011, with mods its even better, not as good looking as skyrim modded but its good.\n\nGameplay - 7/10 You can't jump in this game which is annoying.

The game tells the story of Geralt of Rivia, a Witcher who is trying to recover his lost memories. Witchers are basically superhumans who can also cast spells and work as mercenaries, who can work as bodyguards, monster hunters, etc.\nIn the beginning he is blamed for the murder of King Foltest (who he was working for at the moment) and went to jail. While there, he is given a chance prove his innocence and goes after the King Slayer while still trying to get his memories back.\nIt's good story overall. I might not be the best but it's certainly good, especially due to the fact that your choices can completly change the Storyline and it has around 4 major endings.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nMany people keep complaining about the battle system, but I actually enjoyed it. However, it takes some time until you get used to it.\nGeralt has 2 different swords: one is made of steel and the other is made of silver. The steel sword it's used against enemies such humans and elves and the silver one it's used against monsters. He can perform a quick and a heavy attack.\nGeralt can cast 5 different spells, a.k.a. signs: \n[b]-Aard[/b]: Knocks back the enemies, preventing them from blocking your next attacks. There's also a chance of stunning the enemies, which allows you to kill them with just one hit;\n[b]Yrden[/b]: Creates a trap which stuns the enemies and prevent them from defending themselves;\n[b]Ignis[/b]: Geralt casts a fire ball;\n[b]Quen[/b]: Provides full damage protection for a short period of time against a few hits;\n[b]Axii[/b]: Used to turn an enemy against their allies and to persuade NPCs during some dialogues\n\nHis health regenerates very slowly even when you are not in combat, but he can speed it up through potions. However he only drink potions by meditating (which can't be done in combat) and he can't drink too many because they're also toxic.\n\n[h1]Visuals and Soundtrack[/h1]\nThe game still looks pretty good, especially considering that it was released back in 2011. To make things even better the soundtrack was also very well produced. Combining both elements you can get easily immerse in this fantasy world.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\nNow it's time for the cons:\n-It's not an easy game, but that's not a problem by itself. The real problem are the difficulty spkies, which can be really frustating and some enemies that might seem cheap;\n-The lack of a fast travel mechanic or even a vehicle or an animal to walk around the map can be annoying at times. It might feel good to walk around exploring the world, but when you pass multiple times through the same area it can get a bit annoying;\n-The game doesn't explain certain parts such as mutagens and alchemy.\n\n\n\nOverall it's really solid title and I recommend it to every RPG fan.", "timestamp_created": 1470830786, "timestamp_updated": 1471028219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669538557529449463", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11595288": {"recommendationid": "11595288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004705689", "num_games_owned": 631, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 14151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432096869}, "language": "english", "review": "I like The Witcher series so much that I buy extra copies, when they go on sale, and give them out to everyone on my friends list like candy.

With many RPG gamers looking forward to the release of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim this PC only release was lost in the hyperbolic praise of Bethesda's role playing juggernaut during end of the year awards. So, in 2012, CDProjekt Red has released an enhanced edition giving PC players ten gigabytes of additional content for free. This content includes all of the patches which added extra quests and fixed a couple of questionable design choices, adds entirely new quests, and cut scenes to flesh the game's narrative out.\n\t\nThe Enhanced Edition opens with a rousing new cut scene depicting the assassination of Demavend, King of Aedirn. Upon starting the game the you take control of the witcher, Geralt, who is aiding Kind Foltest in a military endeavor to reclaim his bastard children. Success comes but the victory is short lived as Foltest is snuffed out and Geralt is blamed for his demise. From here the narrative takes off as Geralt hunts down Foltest's assassin simply to clear his name. Amidst the hunt for the assassin of kings, political turmoil unfolds and Geralt seeks details on his lost love Yennifer. It's a top shelf fantasy RPG narrative, structured like a great season of a television show, with three big narrative threads that are explored as the game progresses. Like a television show, the game ends with some elements of the narrative resolved while others are escalating and awaiting a sequel. The world of the Witcher is dark and morally ambiguous which makes the element of choice the player us given extraordinarily satisfying. Making choices in The Witcher 2 is not about being a good witcher or a bad witcher, its about what you, the player, see fit to do. While Bioware's games are top notch, relegating in-game choices to a binary moral scale diminishes the impact of many decisions. Also, the choices in The Witcher 2 do have an impact on the events of the game\u2014a significant impact. A choice you make at the end of the first chapter completely changes your perspective on the second chapter. The quest line completely changes so you will want to play this game at least twice to get the full effect and, depending on how dedicated you are, maybe several more times.  \n\nThe narrative plays out over a prologue, three chapters and an epilogue. The three chapters make up the bulk of the game and each is confined to a single location. There is no way to travel back to previous locations once the chapter concludes. This is a narrative driven game and it wants you to move forward. Many players used to games like those in The Elder Scrolls or Gothic series may be upset by this but the narrative so greatly benefits from this rigid structure that it's hard to make a case for a more open format. Each locale is loaded with side quests and very few of them feel like obnoxious chores; a problem that plagues many other RPG experiences. The sidequests mix in some character development, world building and humor generally enriching the core experience. \n\t\nThere are two very compelling reasons to do all of the sidequests in a location. The first is that resources in The Witcher 2 are very limited. Unlike most modern RPGs, you can't really grind for money. Reselling items, gear and raw materials nets such a small portion of the items original value that it's not worth doing for the sake of recouping your money. You will have to carefully decide what you can craft and what you should buy since simply buying the gear and items you want will quickly deplete your coiffures. The second reason to do all of those extra quests is to drink in the staggeringly beautiful world that The Witcher 2 offers. The Witcher 2 set a new graphical benchmark with its richly detailed and carefully crafted world. You really have to search hard for an ugly texture. Everything from the biggest building to the smallest environmental prop is detailed and rendered with care. One of the standout quests in the third chapter takes you to  a mage's laboratory that is filled with trinkets, equipment and murals. It's dimly lit, with sinister stones protruding from the walls. Acquiring new armor is rewarding even if the stats aren't a significant improvement over what you have just because the detail put into it is so fantastic. It's a shame that the facial animations don't quite match the graphical leap forward. They are not bad but they are decidedly current gen in a game that was ahead fo the graphical curve on release.\n\t\nCombat in The Witcher 2 has been massively overhauled from the first game. Geralt can lay traps, use rudimentary magics and is an accomplished swordsman. Even if you don't focus on leveling spell casting or using traps Geralt is still competent enough to make use of these abilities. Some will see the lack of opportunity to really build a Geralt to their personal style but it's as a consequence of the character's lore. You still place skill points in the appropriate trees to buff the abilities of your choice but you don't really spec into an archetypical fantasy class. When it comes to wielding his blades, Geralt has two swords, a silver blade for monsters and a steel blade for humans. He can parry and counter so timing your attacks in key. Certain traps are more effective for some enemies and magic is a mix of healing, buffing and attacking. It's quite a repertoire and you are left with no shortage of tactical options. Fortunately, a new tutorial was added to the Enhanced Edition to help players come to grips with Geralt's skills and abilities. One rather irritating quirk of the combat is the fact that Geralt can only use potions outside of battle so this can turn some encounters into a trial and error affair. You often have to fail in a battle to see what potions may be worth using. It never makes the game annoying... It just makes alchemy feel pointless. Combat requires some skill and forethought but shouldn't be too taxing to a competent gamer and generally proves rewarding.\n\nThe Witcher 2 was a great game with a few annoying flaws. The Enhanced Edition addresses many of these and goes above and beyond with meaningful new in game content. It's packed with new cutscenes and the new quests are some of the best in the game. The structure is rigid when compared to some other RPGs but it boasts a stronger, more direct narrative as a result. The ability to make choices in the game is enriching and adds tremendous replay value and the visuals look great three years after it's initial release. The combat is solid though the alchemy system is quirky to the point of being almost pointless. None of the flaws present will stay with you for long after you complete this game though. It's likely that you will be more concerned with what CDProjekt Red has in store for us in the next Witcher release.

(Even when you spent 50 hours to do all the side quests and trying to read in-game books, chat with NPCs and trying to get much info about in-game world as possible)\n\nWhen you playing the game second time - just curious what happen if you change your choices and play style (harder difficulty, different skill tree) - you would stay stunned like \"HOLY SHIT! There are so much possibilities, characters, events, new unexplored areas, new quests, connections, consequences and points of views I could not even imagine on first time play.\"  There it comes the moment you start really realize what have you trully done, changed, and to whom you probably helped on the first play. (In game there are lots of shady characters and you can never be sure of their goal and side when you just look at them from one point of view). Obviously the second play results in decision, that you have to play that game at least one more time.\n\nTo deeper understanding the story I really recommend to read all Witcher books from Andrzej Sapkowski which are events before Witcher games. And in Witcher 2 you would need those information much more then in Witcher 1 (one could say that you really dont need to know much about books in W1) to get full understanding about what is really going on. And what is finaly going to happen in W3 Wild Hunt.\n\nThe impact of your choices to the game characters, lands and whole word order is HUGE and will probably means a LOT in grand finale in Witcher 3 so far as I can see and will be very interesting to see how they change the next episode. Thus I reccomend you to keep your final saves from Witcher 2 to import them to Witcher 3. (I heard that steam cloud only stores last 100 saves. I have about 250 saves on 1 ending, which means you are not able to keep all your endings in cloud after uninstaling. Keep that in mind)\n\nSummary:\n+ Great story continuation of Witcher books by Sapkowski\n+ make your choices and face their consequences\n+ singleplayer you can and should play more then once (multiple endings)\n+ choices and results imported from Witcher 1 and to Witcher 3\n+ shady fantasy world in its real nature (nothing is black and white)\n+ amazing graphic world\n+ nice cinematic scenes\n+ nice soundtrack\n+ swordmanship, magic and potions\n\n- too much saves results in crashing (you need to clean up your old saves in folder from time to time)\n- players thad didnt read books could be a bit lost in plot and could miss much important things (but still could enjoy the playing :p)\n- playing on the highest difficulty is both: incredible easy (most of the time) and almost impossible (on specific event when you lack some specific skill - \"riposte/position/feet work\" seems like Holy Trinity to surviving - which result in \"hours\" of reloading trying to beat the game with different skill tree. Simply boring and makes you angry. Especially without riposte it takes much much much more longer and its very hard to survive when you controll ghost soldiers in ghost battle (it seems that this is the only skill that is usable in that fight and your increased vigor - not through potions though - all other stats, improvements, and skills you choose are not applicable in that part of the game making this one skill like a must-win / must-lose-hard choice.

My main problem with the first game (the fighting mechanics) got a complete overhaul and are now actually one of the game's stronger points.\n\nThe presentation is great. The graphical style, the oversaturated colours and the effects really add up to an amazing experience even today. The music and sound effects are very atmospheric too.

It's an intense ride and after 30 to 40 hours you just don't feel like letting go. Luckily there's a really good incentive to replay the game right away (which I'll do now).\n\nAnother minor complain is the save system. You can save manually and can quicksave, but you can't overwrite older manual saves nor quicksaves. That leads to a huge amount of save files if you don't delete them manually... one by one.

You're also way too underpowered in the beginning and it's hard to win any fight, but that changes later when you can upgrade your ability, and Igni gets the most overpowered thing in the game, lol.  \n\nBut in Chapter II, this game gets REALLY good and made me fall in love with that game very quickly.   \n\nThe cool thing about the game is, that your choices matter and affect the whole storyline of the game.\n\n\n[h1]Pro: [/h1]\n- The Story itself is very good (like in every witcher game)\n- The storytelling is amazing (like in every witcher game)\n- Your choices matter more than in any game I've ever played and even affect dialouges and appearances from chracters in The Witcher 3 wich is just awesome\n- Your choices from The Witcher 1 affect dialogues and sequences in this game, wich, again, is just awesome\n- You can import your items from The Witcher 1 wich is cool, although you get better items very early into the game\n- Many many choices in conversations\n- Voice acting is very good\n- The gameplay is fun\n- For a game from 2011, fuck this game looks good, and doesn't look outdated at all. Skyrim ,wich came out later than this game, looks like shit in comparison.\n- Challenging if you play on Hard (only bossfights)\n- Good level design\n- Many different endings\n- Fun minigames, although they are worse than in The Witcher 1 and The Witcher 3\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n- As I said earlier, you're too underpowered in the Prologue and in the beginning Chapter I\n- Too overpowered in the late game (especially Igni)\n- The UI is like a bad version of The Witcher 3, it's not horrible, but just not the best and the inventory layout is not really good.\n- THIS GAME HAS SO MANY BUGS and crashes so often, it's horrible, but I experienced nothing game-breaking\n- Some quests don't have much explenation, so either you have to search soo long for some stuff, or just look it up in the internet wich I usually avoid to do, but in here I just had to\n\nThat's it, it's an amazing game. \n[h1][b]9/10[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1509137057, "timestamp_updated": 1509137082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.71385502815246582", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29399205": {"recommendationid": "29399205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011119127", "num_games_owned": 706, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 1381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507753313}, "language": "english", "review": "A great Role Playing Game.\n\n\nWhat i felt was good:\n+ The design of the world, it is beautifully handcrafted.\n+ Rich lore thanks to The Witcher books\n+ Voice acting is great.\n+ No pansy censorship.\n+ You have to actually study/read ingame books to figure out how to battle certain enemies or what piece of puzzle you are missing to finish a quest (one does not simply \"find an Endrega Queen in XY coordinate marked on your map\").

Following clues, finding key people and killing monsters will be the foundations for this new quest for the Witcher. More and complicated political issues and alliances are part of the story this time, as we have to take sides, each side leading to new missions and characters.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe Witcher 2 is a totally different game if we compare it to the original title, controls have been changed making gameplay more difficult to get used to, as we must learn how to use every new control and key. Bombs, traps and daggers were incorporated to make gameplay more varied, we still have the use of signs and our well-known steel and silver swords.\n\nOn this occasion, signs feel more significant, they have a different touch, this time signs make you feel they are important to use depending on the battle we are having or the danger we are facing, they are concise and powerful to use, they deliver powerful blows and do a great deal of damage, even more if you level up the power and use of stamina.\n\nBombs, traps and daggers are a great new addition, but in my case, I stuck only to bombs as they are more reliable and have more variation, poisonous, shrapnel, explosive, you name it, we have many different bombs for different situations, they are created the same way potions are created, by meditating, just get the right ingredients and the formula and you are all set.\n\nThe new system includes quickslots, very helpful in fighting situations, here you can select which kind of secondary attack you wish to use, bombs, traps and daggers are the only options.\n\nMeditating is still tactical, as you may know, the witcher games are not the typical hack \u2018n\u2019 slash game, before going into any battle against monsters or humans, meditating is important and a must for you have to drink the right potion and brew what you need for battle, this characteristic has been improved as well, we no longer need a fire to meditate, just any place with no danger around will suffice. Leveling up will give us points we can spent on the skill tree where we have four paths, each of these paths have multiple options we can improve, so choosing correctly is up to you.\n\nDepending on the development of your skill tree Geralt will start showing more fighting moves, the power of signs will increase, toxicity tolerance will improve and also a new addition has been introduced, the adrenaline rush, a perk that will deliver a killing move as an in-game cinematic.\n\nTW2 offers more variety regarding armors and swords, the previous title was very limited and the creation of new swords was narrowed to some few silver and steel swords, even worst for armor sets, here we get to find new and better armor sets with many different perks and characteristics, the same for swords, blacksmiths are more common and ingredients for the creation of new tools are plentiful.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nTW2 is a beautiful game, it is a gigantic step taken if we compare it to the original witcher, gameplay changed so did graphics and effects, it feels smoother and more defined. While the graphics are one of a kind here, the game also offers a great detail in weather effects and it adds a more consistency regarding the climate as well as day and night cycles. The engine really shines every time many of these aspects interact whether in battle or just when searching for clues related to any of the many missions and side-quests. There are little details in all sort of vegetation, the skies show multiple effects depending on the levels and sometimes in the distance the firmament is shown full of stars. More importantly, the engine is very keen to show off the diversity in the main cities we visit. Especially Upper Aedirn, a fantastic city built by dwarves, every stone, from a little stone to the biggest of the constructions the city is of a great design, it really captures the atmosphere of a place that has seen countless battles, magnificent.\n\n[h1]Sound and voices[/h1]\n\nThe series has always been very serious regarding sound and voice acting, and this time is not an exception, voice actors did a great job on every aspect of the acting, characters are believable and demonstrate different kind of accents during the story, we even get to listen to more of the elves\u2019 language, superb work, nothing negative here.\n\nAs for sound, TW2 is solid, we can feel the atmosphere on any landscape\u2019s sound, nature, monsters etc. Everything is unique and deserves attention while the music adds intention and action to every battle, mission and interaction. Outstanding.\n\n[h1]The bad but not serious[/h1]\n\nPerhaps what makes this game difficult to get used to is the amount of characters, their personal views, politics and different story lines and past events that make the lore of the witcher a deep abyss of details, it might be complicated for people not familiar with the books, at least, on my first play through, I felt lost in the middle of the politics, unlike the original witcher, TW2 shows a more mature and adult view of the world. I would mention not to pick this one without a little bit of knowledge related to the lore, I strongly recommend the books to get a better insight of the witcher world and politics, after that, the series starts to be easier to understand and at the same time it helps appreciate even more the different aspects of the game, the kingdoms, lands and peoples, wars and history.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nAs I said before, The Witcher 2 is a more mature game, a more adult-oriented title that will not disappoint at all, it has the depth regarding stories and lore, and it shows a more complex game style, definitely a must for RPG lovers and fans of the books.", "timestamp_created": 1463019202, "timestamp_updated": 1466626523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.743290543556213379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40818718": {"recommendationid": "40818718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185481023", "num_games_owned": 417, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 3139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1521072829}, "language": "english", "review": "great world, complex political intrigue, and meaningful choices.", "timestamp_created": 1521068279, "timestamp_updated": 1521068279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.690833032131195068", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12606907": {"recommendationid": "12606907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078130381", "num_games_owned": 450, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417280884}, "language": "english", "review": "Witcher 2 deservers the title \u201cThe Best RPG of the Year\u201d in my opinion.

These choices are not black and white, good or evil but often fall in the moral grey area forcing you to really think about your actions. Every choice has good and bad points and often carries consequences with it.  \n\n+ Well written side-quest that offer multiple ways of completing them. Some side quests span the entirety of the game depending on your choices. \n\n+ The story is very deep and complex and can be overwhelming given the number of people and locations involved. The story deals heavily in politics and power and those that really immerse themselves in the lore will truly appreciated everything the designers and writers have made.  \n\n+ 3 skill trees; magic, swordsman and alchemy, each one provides a different way of engaging enemies in battle. \n\n+ Find items, plants allowing you to craft potions and equipment\n\n+ Lots of mods \n\nThe Average:\n\n+/- Combat is much improved over the first game but still feels a bit lackluster compared to other games. You must invest in certain skills for combat to become more flexible.  It isn\u2019t until halfway through the game when you have enough experience points for combat to feel a bit more engaging. You can\u2019t move and block at the same time making it almost pointless to block.   \n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The game does not overwrite any saves, doesn\u2019t matter if its an autosave, manual save or quicksave, it makes a new file for each one. After a few hours of playtime you could have a lot of saves that could cause problems. \n\n- This game has a nasty cloud save bug where it no longer works properly causing you to lose many hours of game time. Disabling steam cloud doesn\u2019t seem work and the \u2018solution\u2019 to fix this doesn\u2019t always work.  Deleting and reinstalling also didn\u2019t work. \n\nConclusion:\nA brilliant RPG that isn\u2019t afraid to deal with serious, mature subject matter. Your choices carry a lot of weight making the story feel more impactful. A combat system that takes a while to really feel good and a nasty technical bug holds it back. \n", "timestamp_created": 1492648880, "timestamp_updated": 1492648880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.725671112537384033", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "44717654": {"recommendationid": "44717654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198853944523", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1541098564}, "language": "english", "review": "Another fantastic story/game from CDPR.\n\nI really enjoyed the Witcher 1 and this is a complete upgrade.\n\nBetter graphics, better combat.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to Witcher fans or story lovers.", "timestamp_created": 1536869459, "timestamp_updated": 1536869459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669070839881896973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35549779": {"recommendationid": "35549779", "author": {"steamid": "76561198292273381", "num_games_owned": 764, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508764318}, "language": "english", "review": "It has a surprisingly good graphic even it's a 2011 game.\n\nStill I couldn't run the game on ultra spec smoothly on my GTX 1060 (lose framerate especially when I turn around the camera quickly and I can't slow down because the mouse is too sensitive).

Meanwhile also addressing the issue of Geralt missing memory and the conflict between two groups the Blue Stripes and the Scoia'tael.\n\nYou will be thrown into a world where everyone is fighting for something and you will be right in the middle of It all.\n\n[h1] Characters [/h1]\n\n4/5 Very Good\n\nWitcher 2 gives you the return of many beloved characters from the first game, from Dandelion our great bard, to Zoltan, Triss and so many more. It also presents you too an amazing new batch of characters which you will come to love or even hate throughout your journey.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\n3/5 Average\n\nThe combat is a massive improvement to the first witcher game, It's a more action based combat witch focus on dodging, parrying, using your signs (magic), throwing knives and even putting traps on the path of your enemies. Going from melee to using signs or even putting traps is a more smooth transition compared to the first game.\n\nPotions and oils give you more diversity in combat, even if you don't particularly go out of your way to use them, potions still have a great use (from seeing in the dark, to giving you toxic tolerance, etc) and oils give you a wide arrange of extra damage (from bleeding damage, to toxic damage and even extra % damage to certain monsters).\n\nBosses are sometimes frustrating because of the clunky controls (I'm looking at you kayran) but overall they were pretty fun.\n\nIt's quite clunky and maybe sluggish at times, It could improve in a lot of areas, but still a lot better than the first Witcher combat.\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\n4/5 Very Good\n\nGraphics are, again, a massive improvement compared to the first game. The only thing which bothered me was the massive amounts of bloom, Its one of those things whether you like it or not, personally I thought it was overdone.\n\n[h1] User Interface [/h1]\n\n3/5 Average\n\nI had to sneak a user interface topic on this review, why? Because It's a pretty annoying interface. Its clumsy, sluggish and even playing with a controller doesn't make it any better.\nIf you ask me what is the worst part of the Witcher 2 I won't think twice in saying Its the User Interface.\n\n[h1] Soundtrack and Voice Acting [/h1]\n\n4/5 Very Good\n\nI must say Witcher 2 has an amazing soundtrack, I love It even more than the first game sound. A shout out to the amazing composers (Adam Skorupa, Krzysztof Wierzynkiewicz, Marcin Przyby\u0142owicz, Micha\u0142 Cielecki) that made this fantastic music.\n\nVoice acting I feel is the same has the first game, they nailed most if not all of the main character voices, but some side quest characters just sound generic.\n\n[h1] Personal Opinion [/h1]\n\nIt is a great game, the combat and interface could be better, but the story/lore and the amazing characters make up for those little flaws.

The story is amazing, voice acting is great, maybe not as polished as the Witcher 3, but still great. Playing through this will help understand a lot of things in TW3. Buy it, it's great value for money, especially considering there is a lof of replayability, given the 16 endings based on your choices, and different Acts 2/3.\n\nDetailed:\nInitially almost refunded it. The installation includes a scan for 'optimal' settings, which is completely broken. It was so unoptimised, the motion blur gave me motion sickness... 2-3 hours of my playtime went into that launcher toying with the settings until I got it right. Even though I cover it sufficiently, and should be able to play on max settings, I had to tone down a few things and disable all motion blurs. Boom, now it was playable.\n\nThe Enhanced edition seems to have the Arena tutorial, which I only used to test my graphics setup to be honest. It's something you may like to skip, pretty awful. I actually used the Prologue as a tutorial, works fine.\n\nCombat is a bit clunky, not as polished as in TW3, but after getting used to it...makes sense. The Space key is your friend. \n\nThe game is not as linear as the first game, but not open world like TW3. You still get plenty of areas to explore and side quests to do. I disliked the carry weight limit, but that can be fixed with mods. Some people dislike the lack of fast travel, I was okay with it. Apart from some mob farming for a certain armor in Act 1 that took forever and Geralt wore the shoes off his feet, there isn't too much tourism.\n\nThe story is great. Your choices matter, and for some of them there are real repercussions, like SPOILER ALERT the fate of entire kingdoms! Yeah, plural. Intricate story-telling, not too pushy, keeps you interested, although can be confusing at times for people new to the Witcher world. It actually made me buy the books to learn some of the references, so there you go.\n\nThere are indeed whorehouses. I must have paid 2,000+ orens for such services just for the fun of it. Great stuff. There are also other options, ahem, but you'll find that on your own.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game, if unoptimised for a lot of devices. The story wins you over and it's definitely worth the money. Even better if you buy the game during a sales period, like I did. Will definitely make the TW3 more enjoyable and enhance the experience there. Also whorehouses.\n\nBuy it.", "timestamp_created": 1482236059, "timestamp_updated": 1482240951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669268786907196045", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25062794": {"recommendationid": "25062794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161141911", "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 327, "playtime_forever": 1534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471819074}, "language": "english", "review": "Witcher 2 improves over the original in almost every way. The combat is the biggest change it\u2019s much better overall.  Just like the first game the story is one of the best stories I have played in a video game, I feel so involved in everything that is happening. The amount of detail in the lore just makes the whole experience very rich. Amazing writing, character depth and voice acting sell these characters as real people. Every character is fascinating and you want to learn more about them and in doing so you become more connected to them. The way the story changes by the choices you make has never been so expansive as it was in this game. One choice in particular about a third into the game changes the outcome in the story completely and it almost becomes two games in one because the outcome is so different between each other they end up being completely different experiences. The only thing that keeps this game from being a 10 is the linearity, it is a very linear experience overall, there isn\u2019t much free roaming you can do it\u2019s only strict linear paths. This is something I know the witcher 3 addresses which I am looking forward to.\n9/10 (Amazing)", "timestamp_created": 1471819597, "timestamp_updated": 1471819597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679222524166107178", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23518710": {"recommendationid": "23518710", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995195436", "num_games_owned": 764, "num_reviews": 135, "playtime_forever": 2087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465725308}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Immersive story with a terrific graphics [/h1]\n\nThe Witcher 2: Assassins of The Kings is a game which is able to devour you for days and you still won't have enough of it after finishing. The game noticeably focuses on storytelling and explicates everything to the detail so even the most curious and demanding players get their money's worth. \n\nThe famous witcher, Geralt of Rivia, lost his memory and slowly remembers what had happened. On his way he has many options what to do, how to respond or react, but still everything revolves around a mysterious slayer of the kings. This assassin might be the key to Geralt's past.
