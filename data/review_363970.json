At first it is very easy to progress and it becomes much faster once you get a couple of Hero Souls by Ascending. There is alot more strategy than one might expect from a free game. You must decide who to upgrade, which skills to buy, which things to spend you Hero Souls on, which things to spend your Ancient Souls on, when to Ascend, when to Transcend, which heroes to Gild, what missions to send your mercenary, to revive or bury your mercenary, which clan to join, and much more! A great game to just waste some time without spending money. It's free, why not give it a try?\n\n[b] This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: [/b]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curation\n\nThis review is just my opinion.

It is NOT a game you play by clicking your mouse constantly (or even often), and it's also not a game you'll necessarily want to leave running in the background. This is a game you genuinely play.\n\nA typical session consists of only a minute or two of clicking monsters, then some sorting of treasure; a few decisions about which heroes, artifacts, or demigods to level up; a handful of silly but fun distractions, and contemplation or planning for the next ascension. This last is a prestige-style restart where you cash in your earnings (\"hero souls\") for a considerable DPS bonus, which you can then use to get past the next hurdle (difficult bosses, expensive heroes). If you don't mind sacrificing some of the direct DPS boon, you can spend your hero souls leveling up your demigods and applying bonuses to your heroes.\n\nNone of this requires impressive math skills, but it definitely scratches an itch somewhere, and people with impressive math skills have poured their hearts out in countless guides and theorycraft articles. Most importantly, there's a gut-level fun to the whole thing once you get in a ways. I'm tempted to make a Busy Box comparison, except for the game's one real failing, which is in the sound department. Very few sound effects, and one song on repeat forever. With more bells and whistles and a few extra tunes, Clicker Heroes would be damned near perfect. For the time being, it's probably the only game I've ever made a habit of playing with the sound completely turned off.

As far as idle/incremental games it's one of the better ones I've seen. The devs interact with players, updates are done relatively frequently, and the game is very bright and cheerful. It even has some (minor) lore aspects, a bit of story is told, though if you're looking for a game centered around story, this is probably not it.\n\nRecently, patch 1.0 came out bringing Clicker Heroes into its first full version. There's been a lot of knee-jerk reactions with a new system (transcendence) that came out with 1.0, in which you trade in most of what you have for some mechanics that greatly speed up your game. Because the very first run after this \"transcending\" is very slow, there has been some negative reactions towards the game. Most people who have spent the couple hours that it takes to get back into the soul gain levels have found the update very enjoyable, whereas those who quit tend to not spend those couple hours. Please take those reviews with a grain of salt! The game does have its problems, but transcendence is not one of them.\n\nEdit: For anyone wondering, I have a large amount of time spent on this game because it's an idle game. I leave it open full time to idle through it.\n\nEdit 2: A few updates have come out since my review. Primarily, \"offline\" (as in, when the game is closed) progression was added, which makes it much easier to play this game casually.", "timestamp_created": 1465767000, "timestamp_updated": 1480116381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 101, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.827026903629302979", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39539151": {"recommendationid": "39539151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147753994", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 3168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546523437}, "language": "english", "review": "===[ \u2764 Audience: ]===\n\u2611 Kids\n\u2611 Everyone\n\u2611 Casual players\n\u2611 Pro players\n\n===[ \u263c Graphics: ]===\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2610 Really bad\n\u2611  Bad\n\u2610 OK\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\n===[ $ Price/quality: ]===\n\u2610 Full price\n\u2610 Wait for sale\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Refund it if you can\n\u2610 Don't do it\n\u2611 Free\n\n===[ \u2623 Requirments: ]===\n\u2611 90' PC\n\u2611 Minimum\n\u2610 Medium\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 High end\n\u2610 NASA computer\n\n===[ \u263c Difficulty: ]===\n\u2611 You just need 2 arms\n\u2610 Ez\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Hard (first few hours)\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n\n===[ \u06de Game time/length ]===\n\u2610 Really short ( 0 - 2 hours)\n\u2610 Short ( 2 - 8 hours)\n\u2610 Few hours ( 8 - 12 hours)\n\u2610 Long ( 12+ hours)\n\u2611 Endless\n\n===[ \u266c Story] ===\n\u2611 It doesn't have\n\u2610 Still better than Twilight\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Fantastic\n\n===[ \u00a7 Bugs ]===\n\u2610 Game itself is one big BUG\n\u2610 Bugs destroying the game\n\u2610 Lot of bugs\n\u2610 Few Bugs\n\u2610 You can use them for speedrun\n\u2611 Nothing\n\n===[ \u2726 Others: ]===\nMultiplayer: NO\nSingleplayer: YES", "timestamp_created": 1516641010, "timestamp_updated": 1516641010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 80, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800502955913543701", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40513781": {"recommendationid": "40513781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113439587", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 71245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1526872564}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth Every Click", "timestamp_created": 1520009628, "timestamp_updated": 1520009628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705049872398376465", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26689365": {"recommendationid": "26689365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050985322", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 55899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497896172}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best clicker type games out there imp. \nFirst of all, CH is very balanced in all stages of the game(early mid and late) and never gets stale because of the trancention-mechanic.\nSecondly, Rubies can be bought with real money, but are actually pretty easy to obtain, which shows that the devs did not want this game to be a buy-to-win.

Pursuing the game actively highly involves clicking the enemy target for as long as your fingers, toes, and other creative means allow you to go on. Do take note, that even if you decided on taking the active route because it may seem like you'll progress faster in the short future, in the long run, the difference isn't as huge as one might think.  \n\nPassive gameplay involves opening the game, leaving a few tweaks on upgrades and then closing the game again. The main aspect of this gameplay is what it does while the game is shut down, as it also fights passively for you once you get your very first few upgrades. \n\nFor both gameplay types there's a later game strategy, as you decide between which skills you use and which special supportive powers called Ancients you invest in (by spending hero souls, the currency of the game). These can highly change the speed of your progression throughout the game. However, sooner or later you'll hit a wall where your damage is simply no longer enough for progressing with your current upgrades. This will force you to start the game countless times back at stage 1 in order to earn more hero souls for upgrades. So, you'll have to gear yourself with remarkable amounts of patience (if you can call it that) if you plan on getting anywhere in this game, as it won't change an inch beyond selecting upgrades.\n\nMy main objective when I started the game was to get its achievements, which I at first thought would've been a breeze considering the lack of any requirements beyond clicking. It's even capable of idling and playing itself while you're gone. How hard can it be? The plan was to only spend small amounts of time on the game, which didn't happen, as the game also rewards you for actively playing. Hoping to rush through the game quicker for the achievements, I continued. \n\n[i]The trap in all of this is for people who wish to 100% it, for this is no easy task due to it being the same thing for something which feels and looks like... an eternity.[/i]\n\nWould I recommend people to play this game? No, I really can't say that there's anything to come here for, other than a quick fix of satisfaction for a few minutes for the active player, just to realise later that you'll be that bit more disappointed that you even spent your time on it in the first place. And as a passive player, you're in for a long wait consisting of tiny upgrading and no variation.\n\nThrough all this, I've learnt that clicker games don't work for me, even though I had thought they might've at first! At least not when it's executed in the way that Clicker Heroes had. Perhaps I would've been better prepared for it in the beginning had it been called Passive Heroes. And maybe by removing the clicking feature alltogether, and making it a passive waiting game would've made the experience very different.\n\ntldr;\nIt gets tedius very, very fast and you should probably be spending your gaming time elsewhere. I wouldn't want to recommend such an experience to anyone. It feels like a human experiment. The princess is in another castle~ \n\nOverall, if you insist and MUST play it, I would recommend the passive route a lot more and think of the game as passive heroes instead of clicker heroes, as the reward vs investment in active gameplay is just not there.", "timestamp_created": 1438533582, "timestamp_updated": 1454072769, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 131, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768117070198059082", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48451964": {"recommendationid": "48451964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198846211682", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 166648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1551711343}, "language": "english", "review": "I played a bit.

It exposes all the math underneath the game.  Do you understand the difference between arithmetic, geometric, and exponential progression?  That will help you more than anything for this game.  Progression requires exponential power, but it's given to you at a lesser level.  That means that eventually you hit a wall and have to \"ascend\".  This starts the game over, but parts of your progress you retain for the next \"life\".\n\nA recent patch added an additional level of \"starting over\" called Transcension.  This wipes out an additional level of stuff but allows you to progress further and faster next time.  So you are replaying the same game hundreds of times... I'm on life (ascension) #888, transcension #13.  Most of those ascensions are from before that patch, hence the over 5000 hours of gameplay.\n\nYou can click (no aiming necessary) and progress, but the game supports an idle style as well.  Clicking will eventually win out, but you can wait a day or two before you start that part.  Autoclickers are now part of the gameplay, as long as you are willing to \"pay\" for it.  You can pay for rubies as an in-game currency, but a purchase is not necessary.  The game also awards you rubies for clicking on certain items, and I swear it gives me more when I'm not looking.  These can be used to purchase in-game auto-clickers (as opposed to external programs that send clicks to the window).  I paid for a couple of things because I wanted to support the devs.\n\nOther than the numbers, there's no real reward.  No story line.  Just higher and higher exponents, like now I've sacrificed 7.597 x 10^30  hero souls.  What other game makes you read floating point notation (like 7.597e30) to understand the game?  \n\nAnd what the heck is Transcendent Power?  I'd have to explain the whole game to get to that point, but then this would not be a review.  Read up on the Clicker Heroes subreddit, start yourself out slowly.  You'll be bewildered for a while, but slowly you'll come around.\n\nPros:\n* The dev team is very active and is still updating gameplay with new ideas and improvements.\n* Active player community with dev invovlement on reddit (/r/ClickerHeroes).\n* Number watching is somehow thrilling.  Is my nerd showing?\n* Game well-balanced and thought out.\n\nCons (all very minor):\n* Relics are largely useless, except where they boost your Atman level.  Even then not so much.\n* Mercenaries die far too randomly, IMHO.  Revival can cost astronomical and economically unfeasible amounts of rubies.\n* The wandering click-on animal to activate a random skill is also largely useless.\n* Does anyone actually send their mercenaries out on skill activation quests?\n* The first ascension is painfully slow and requires a lot of handholding.  Requires \"tricks\" of play to reduce this problem, but it is not fully eliminated.\n* Raids don't give a lot of hero souls, but perhaps because I'm the only one in the guild.\n* Relic levelling is awkward to accomplish and unreasonably expensive after the first few levels.  A high-level relic costs the same 1 core to increase by one level as a low-level one, but this always increases quadratically per added level (not the existing level of the relic).", "timestamp_created": 1483389995, "timestamp_updated": 1483675289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696830391883850098", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17988959": {"recommendationid": "17988959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118473843", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517180104}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Ever wondered what one quadrillion damage per second feels like?\" the store page asks.

When the monster dies it drops gold. You accumulate gold and purchase upgrades which makes your clicking stronger. Monsters only vary in visual display and have no abilities or resists. Only an ever increasing pool of health which is depenant on the zone level. Killing 10 monsters in a zone level will open up the next zone level. Every 10 zone levels there are Bosses. Special monsters with much more health which only give you a timewindow of 30 seconds to beat before they restet to full health and the time window starts anew. You must kill these in order to progress and can see them as \"benchmarks\" to check if you are ready or not.\n\nApart from active play the game will simulate your progress (measured by your DPS, not clicking damage) even if you are offline tho you cannot progress passively (yet). Entering the next zone is an active thing but if you are missing out on gold to purchase that next upgrade you can let it run in offline mode for an hour or two and continue from there.\n\n\n[b][u]going deeper[/u][/b]\n\nClicking is only your first layer tho. You quickly open up new heroes which provide you with your second layer of gameplay. DPS aka Damage Per Second. These heroes deal damage over time on their own. Even if you stop clicking damage will continue to pour in. So DPS is kind of like a passive buff for your game. Apart from buying heroes to become active (first purchase to level 1) you can continue leveling them up to make their DPS stronger in turn enhancing your killing power of the monsters on the screen. \n\nIn addition each hero has a set of abilities which unlock at certain levels (10, 25, 50, 75 and 100) providing better capabilities or ACTIVE ABILITIES\n\n\n[b][u]it becomes more then mindless clicking[/u][/b]\n\nThere are 9 active abilities you can trigger at any point. Each one has an effect duration (usually 30 seconds) and a cool-down preventing you from spamming them. Effects range from more click damage to more gold per kill to support buffs and even a permanent damage buff. Unlocking these abilities and timing their use will become a key part of defeating higher level Bosses\n\n\n[b][u]it just doesnt stop[/u][/b]\n\nThere will be a point where you ll run into a \"wall\". Monsters will become so powerfull that it takes a long time to kill them and bosses will eventually become so mighty that you will be unable to beat them even if you use all your active abilities. This is the point where you use the \"Ascension\" feature for the first time.\n\nAt first it doesnt sound like anything anybody in his right mind would do. \"Creates a new universe, much like the current one. This will restart your game and you will receive XXX Hero Souls\".\n\nWait.....It just resets my game to level one....all gold and hero levels are gone and I simply start over? LAME!!!!!!\n\nBut wait....whats these hero souls then?\n\n\n[b][u]Hero Souls....the meta game[/u][/b]\n\nHero Souls are kind of a permanent currency coming through an ascension. Each one you have banked (read....showing in your display) will increase your damage by 10%. Its accumulative so if you have 5 your whole damage will increase by 50%. With 10 of these babies you ll DOUBLE your damage. So even tho you have to go through all the levels you beat beforehand a second time.....THIS time will be far easier and much quicker to get to the point where you grinded to a stop before and continue past that point.\n\nAnd thats not all. As a permanent currency they open up the market for a special sort of heroes. The Ancients.\n\n\n[b][u]Ancient Heroes....the game turns tactical[/u][/b]\n\nWhat makes these heroes special is that they also....just like Hero Souls transfer through an ascension and you gonna keep them. There is a whole list of them and each one buffs your game in a special way. Purchasing them costs hero souls. Leveling them up costs hero souls and you ll need to start thinking about what will give you the most bang for your buck (read....do you keep the HS banked or do you invest them?)\n\nYou ll soon realize that many ancients support each other so getting the \"right mix\" of ancients can massively increase your efficiency at going through the treadmill (ascend and go through all those levels again).\n\n\n[b][u]The truth comes out...whats it all about[/u][/b]\n\nNow the game shows its true color. With all these features unlocked you are ready for the neverending(!) \"management and improvement of resources\" to push further on a new try which makes so many other genres successfull.\n\n4x\nRTS\nRPGs\nARPGs\nEconomy Simulations\n\nIf you enjoy any of these genres chances are you ll LOVE clicker heroes. Its free to play so what do you have to lose?\n\n\n\nMe...I find myself booting it up almost every day and even tho I ascended more then a hundred times already it doesnt really get old. The asciension is more like a \"test run\" by now to see if you made the correct choices on spending your hero souls and which ancients to get and level. Its this \"game within game\" which makes me come back....certainly not the clicking. Theres some form of \"grinding\" to get enough HS but many games have this so not really a problem.\n\nIts a most simple game and the fact that its so addictive is baffling in itself.\n\nFor myself I can say that its been a great way to \"waste\" my freetime so far.

It's more about calculation to figure out the best DPS and fastest way to gain \"hero souls\" than it is about clicking.\n\nThe way it works, you get a whole bunch of heroes. The first one improves your click damage, and all other heroes do DPS, which is an acronym that stands for Damage Per Second. Literally, they do damage automatically and you don't need to do anything for it. You increase their level to make them do more damage using gold dropped by monsters you kill. At certain levels, a new skill unlocks which gives effects ranging from increasing that hero's damage by 100%, or increasing overall DPS by all your heroes by 25%, increasing your click damage by a certain percentage of your heroes' total DPS (which is actually the brunt of your click damage), etc. Some of them teach a skill. There are nine skills in the game. For example, Clickstorm is a skill that automatically does 10 clicks per second for 30 seconds, with a 10 minutes cooldown. Proper use of skills is important to kill monsters faster. Especially because...\n\nThere are bosses. You have 30 seconds to kill them. If you don't kill them in time, you can't progress to the next stage. Every stage consists of ten monsters, and there is a boss every five stages, on multiples of five. By stage 100 and above, bosses have a chance to be \"Primal\", which is a special version of the boss that drops \"hero souls\". Every boss from stages in multiples of ten starting from stage 100 (100, 110, 120, etc) give a \"gild\" to a random hero from your list. At stage 100, you also unlock ancients.\n\nHero souls is a special \"currency\" that does two things. First, it increases your base DPS (what you have when you start the game) by 10% for each hero soul you have. It doesn't show in your DPS that is shown in your total current DPS shown in the hero tab, but it definitely affects it. Having hero souls is important to improve your damage and general progression, or else your DPS is too slow. However, they also serve as currency to unlock ancients.\n\nAncients are special \"characters\" that do various passive bonuses. There are a bit over 20 of them, and four are selected randomly for you to pick one from. It can be rerolled if you don't want them, but that costs hero souls. Anyway, ancients effects include increasing all your DPS by a certain amount but only when you are idle (i.e. not clicking or using skills for 60 seconds), increasing the amount of time you get to fight a boss, increasing click damage, getting a LOT more gold from random treasure chests, etc. Ancients are absolutely key to progressing in the game, so you need to find a good balance between keeping enough hero souls on yourself to keep a good DPS bonus, while still improving your ancients that will benefit you more than the hero souls' DPS you lose for improving said ancients. It can get very technical on a mathematical level.\n\nGilds are a type of bonus awarded to your heroes. They're assigned to a random hero when you get them from defeating a boss that is a  multiple of 10 starting from stage 100, but it is later possible to move them to other heroes for a cost (in hero souls). A gild improves that hero's damage by 50%, and gilds are cumulative. For instance, having five gilds on a hero increases its damage by 250%. You definitely want those on heroes that gain a lot of \"attack bonus\" skills on themselves (such as Masked Samurai) rather than on heroes that have other effects that don't involve having a lot of DPS (such as Alexa which mostly improves click and critical damage, Midas which mostly improves gold drops, etc).\n\nFinally, \"Ascension\" is the other important mechanic to explain. Once you get the skill \"ASCENSION\" from the hero named Amenhotep, you can learn the skill to do an ascension, which brings you down to the first stage and you lose all your money and your heroes lose all their skills. In exchange for \"starting over\", you gain a certain amount of hero souls based on a few things.\n\nHero souls gained from killing a Primal boss are only truly awarded after ascending. Also, each 2000 cumulative hero levels you had before ascension give an additional hero soul upon ascension. When you ascend, you keep your gilds and ancients. With the hero souls you gain, you are able to progress faster than the previous time, and you can get overall further and faster. A lot of the joy in the game is the way you get a little bit further than the last time you ascended, each time you get there.\n\nThere's a bit more to the game, but this is most of the important stuff that you need to know. Another thing of note which, to my knowledge, is not explained by the game, is that after level 200, a hero gains four times the amount of DPS as normal, every 25 levels, and most importantly, ten times that amount at level 1000 (and 2000 and 3000). It's important to note because once you get to a certain point and the next hero (Dread Knight) is just faaaaaar too expensive, you want to go back to your first hero and level him up to 1000 which becomes the new best thing, rather than keep increasing the last available hero (Frostleaf) who gains rather minimal DPS. You'll need to ascend many many times before you can even dream of getting Dread Knight, so get those early heroes to level 1000 which is the new meta at that point.\n\nSince a lot of the progression is done through DPS, which is automatic, it's an easy game to play which you can leave running in the background while you do other things and that you can check on once in a while. One thing of note is that when the game is closed, your heroes still are gaining gold from monsters they kill. It's like the game keeps playing itself even when it's closed, although they won't progress to the next level/set of enemies or go past bosses and such. Only gold from monsters of the current highest stage you're at is considered. Since this is such a relaxing game to play, which you don't need to pay a whole lot of attention to most of the time, I recommend it to whoever isn't afraid of doing some maths to maximize their experience with the game. Or following a guide, I suppose. :p\n\nFinally, it is a very known fact that you can use \"autoclicker\" programs with this game. I personally don't because it's not something I feel is natural to the game's intent and purposes, but it's something you can do, which a lot of people do. When playing without, most of the damage come from DPS and you don't need to click and/or can click only for important stuff such as bosses when you need the extra damage (and/or when using all your skills together for burst damage). Of course having such a program running nonstop will be a large part of your damage compared to someone playing without, especially with relevant ancients that complement that, so keep that in mind.", "timestamp_created": 1432898972, "timestamp_updated": 1433721133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.730267941951751709", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39429914": {"recommendationid": "39429914", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960373660", "num_games_owned": 2060, "num_reviews": 1364, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1539886806}, "language": "english", "review": "\udb40\udc21", "timestamp_created": 1516255920, "timestamp_updated": 1527580763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652996838092803955", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 16, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 18015, "total_negative": 2376, "total_reviews": 20391}}
