Let me talk about single-player first.\n\nGTA5 takes place in San Andreas, just like GTA: San Andreas released back in 2004. Rockstar tried hard to make GTA5 as good as possible and it's indeed a fantastic game and a worthy addition to the series and my Steam library. It took me about 40 hours to finish it including side missions.\n\nIt's much better than GTA4, at least when it comes to graphics, map design, missions, vehicles... planes are back, trains are back, parachutes are back.. and almost everything is better except damage system (which is undoubtedly worse). The whole time I was unsure if this is really better than the original San Andreas and honestly I can't tell - 9 years passed between both games, the gameplay and style has changed, both are a bit different, but in my opinion equally good.\n\nThey still didn't get rid of the old bugs like missing cars (your fully upgraded car can disappear anytime unless you watch it 24/7). It's better, every character has his own car that can be modified and whenever you leave it, it will just respawn near your savehouse but sometimes it just disappears randomly just like the normal cars.\n\nit was fun, it's a must have for everyone who likes open-world games. Definitely one of my top 10 games. Now, about multiplayer... it's... unique. Seriously, there's nothing like this out there. GTA Online offers a new open-world+coop experience, it's amazing. Loading times are horrible even on SSDs but the experience is fantastic.\n\nWhat else to say - just get it. If you like open-world games you'll love it. I played on Linux, the game natively only supports Windows but thanks to the official Valve's SteamPlay / Proton feature (translation layer from DirectX 11 to Vulkan) it works on Linux.\n\n[h1]System info & performance report[/h1]\n[table]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Operating system[/td]\n        [td]Arch Linux x64 rolling release | Gnome Shell 3.30[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CPU/GPU/RAM[/td]\n        [td]i5 7300HQ / GTX 1050 Ti [415.27] / 24GB DDR4 2400Mhz[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]Settings & FPS[/td]\n        [td]1080p, high (shadows medium) + FXAA | ~40-50 fps outside[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]Proton[/td]\n        [td]3.16-6 beta[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Number of crashes[/td]\n        [td]0[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Dual monitor experience[/td]\n        [td]No issues[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Controller support[/td]\n        [td]Xbox 360 wireless controller works fine (default Linux kernel driver) but doesn\u2018t reconnect if you turn it off and turn it on back[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1549644855, "timestamp_updated": 1549645170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642554998397827148", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48856489": {"recommendationid": "48856489", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968891535", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 140463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8719, "last_played": 1551856160}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a great game...

Would be a fun game if Rockstar actually wanted people to be able to buy or do anything other than the same missions over and over and over and over and over and over and then someone blows up your stuff and then over and over.... you get the idea. Let's face it everybody now who buys this game buys it for the online. The story mode isn't the problem but Rockstar and the community itself is. If you think you can suck up the grind that Rockstar made so that you can actually enjoy the game itself I'm here to tell you that won't happen. I've owned the game on 360 since the very first online update and trust when I say that the grind I'm talking about will never end. Quite literally because by the time you start to buy something from four updates ago, they release something different that costs even more than the last. Don't even think of buying shark cards. You'd have to pay $1,300 extra because the scumbags never updated the shark cards so that they suffice some of the updates. It's still the same price and worth that it was when online first started and they kept it the same because they know people will be dumb enough to just buy them over and over.\n\nThen maybe you might think ok, well maybe Rockstar doesn't care about modders anymore and I'll just mod my account and get some money. Nope. I recieved money from a modder once then got banned for a month, happened a second time except I was afk and it was literally out of my hands then they permanently banned me. To top that off I know friends who have modded accounts and they typically don't last longer than a month and then you get reset.\n\nAll the content that they add becomes so much less appealing when you realize how much you have to grind to be able to buy it. Hell I even bothered doing the math once and if you want to make let's say $100M which by the way isn't even equivalent to what you see typical let's players or what people think the average account is like. That's about one month of grind IN HOURS not in the actual rate and that was if you literally had every single business, fully upgraded and three people who work with you perfectly all those hours with their own equipment. To own the businesses themselves also takes about a month in hours because you have basically next to nothing to get money in the start to top that off nobody will take you into any missions when your low rank because you won't have any body armor, guns or experience which by itself adds an extra week before your able to buy the businesses.\n\nEvery single complaint about Rockstar support I can promise you is true. They do absolutely no work in reviewing reports. You get reported? Your emblem get reported? Then you can't do a single thing. That combined with one of the absolute worst player bases I've ever seen, will eventually net you trouble because even if you didn't do anything to them, they still can and will just report you without reason. Not to mention the modders that haven't been banned yet breaking servers and possible resetting your character too. So you know. That's fun.\n\nAlright maybe you figure that you don't need the money or any of the content you'll just mess around with friends. Yeah that's not going to happen either. As soon as a jet or player comes remotely close then you already have become a part of a pointless fight with a random. Even half of all the content is locked whenever you try to go into a private lobby so even then your taking it with a grain of salt.\n\nIf you ever consider buying this game, don't ever bother creating and online account. It's way more painful than it is fun.\n\nStory mode wise it's ok. Don't get me wrong it's fun but I owned the game for 5 years and never felt motivated to finish the story. Not to mention nearly every time they update the game almost nothing from that update transfers to story mode aside from some of the cars but that's it. I honestly would just recommend saving your money and getting something you can get more of your money's worth like The Witcher 3 or something like that.", "timestamp_created": 1550192786, "timestamp_updated": 1550193011, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49079949": {"recommendationid": "49079949", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088894703", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549642164}, "language": "english", "review": "I do it for the lulz", "timestamp_created": 1550523981, "timestamp_updated": 1550523981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530639886856079102", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49047474": {"recommendationid": "49047474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062823926", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 4227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 89, "last_played": 1550750375}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a habit of crashing, then loading up and immediately overwriting saves despite being it explicate instructions not to.

Certainly, during this long-waiting, the developers have taken full advantage of new animations and graphics techniques in making GTA a perfect game. When it comes to the graphic aspect of this game, it is, hands down, an advanced game for the year of 2015 in the graphics chapter. And the return ,from GTA San Andreas, of a next-gen Los Santos clearly shows the dedication of Rockstar in evolving its games, with a difference of almost 10 years. Unfortunately I bought the game much later, so the graphics weren't something new to me, but every time I took the controller for a relaxing free roam, I was amazed for every aspect of the map, where you could see the smallest details of its content. The citizens of Los Santos are found all over the city, each with their activities. Some walk on the streets now quiet, now not, of the neighborhoods, others drive in traffic, go to the cinema with their friends, work, relaxing in front of their house and still hundreds of thousands of possibilities they can make. A life-catching city. The map extends with Blaine County near Los Santos, but as most of the Singleplayer's action is happening in the city, the countryside is good just to visit and explore. The details are present anywhere in this game, from the reflection seen in rain's puddles, to footprints left in the grass; I guess I wouldn't have to distinguish real life from the world of GTA.\n\nGTA V Story Mode introduces three playable characters: Franklin, a young black man, a gangster wannabe from his neighborhood; Michael, a rich man who wants to live quietly with his family, but this does not really work for themself; And Trevor, a sort of madman who hasn't abandoned his old habits of selling illegal merchandise through his company. All three characters meet at some point in the story, and their adventure, for some of them, will change their life in many aspects. Also, the secondary characters have a significant impact in their character development and influence their decisions in good or bad, as well as they are, of course, influencing each other and gradually develop through their friendship. That's why at the end of the story you can attach to a certain character, or like me, to all three of them. The story is decent and tells you many ideas about people not good of course; but GTA is not a game for Christian ideas, but a roller coaster of murders and sins, where you are the greatest gangster of the city. Ideas like from a nobody, with help from proffesional relationships, you can become someone; or as much as you want to forget your old habits, temptation always arise and you cannot resist; or being influenced by those next to you can lead you down the path and regret that you have lost what is dearest to you. Most missions are fun; especially those with gunfights, preparations and heists, have offered me a mood of adrenaline during the gameplay.\n\nThe game animations greatly affect gameplay because many of them can interrupt the flow you've caught in battle, driving, or any of your other actions. GTA was never a game based on parkour, so the animations are heavy and slow, plus the lack of jumping in length from distances greater than 2 meters high, resulting in a shame head landing. But instead the driving mechanics are realistic and fluid, and the car you drive has a major impact on your driving performance; Their diversity is extremely high, and they can be improved or not with tuning at the mechanic's workshop; not to mention their customization is ok developed, where physical combinations along with metallic, matte or chrome colors are infinite. The controls in the game are suitable and easy to learn for any gamer-type, the menu is easy to navigate and very detailed with many types of changes in gameplay or graphics, people from Rockstar putting serious prowess on customization and personalization. Despite the consoles, this game can reach on any decent PC a fluid 60 FPS in high graphics, except for the \"long render\" ones, and using a mouse in comparison with the controller for shooting and character control is the best way to play this game. Despite GTA IV, there is no need to make the change from mouse and keyboard to controller through game settings, because with a simple push of a button of one of these peripherals, the game automatically switches on one of these 2 options.\n\nBecause this mod of GTA is very popular, GTA Online is the most overhyped game-mode in the history of GTA. After a long loading screen, the map is still Los Santos and Blaine County; this time: your Criminal Empires. Online servers are sessions up to 30 players, where everyone has the freedom to do whatever they want and how they want it. Activities are many on both sides of farming and just having fun with players. Countless racing circuits with cars, planes, boats, trucks etc, deathmatch maps, co-op missions with different objectives, the popular Heist missions where 4 players can get rich through a few setup missions and a robbery bigger than the one at the beginning of The Dark Knight movie. For beginners, first time in Online is quite confusing. What to do first and where to start because of these multiple possibilities, but with a bit of thinking and information about every job in this game-mode, you can start your criminal empire and observe how it grows gradually. Very hard you will get bored of this game especially if you play it with your friends; says to make money in an illegal way are many: you can sell forged documents or counterfeit cash, drugs, weapons and many other types of black market merchandise, and what you can buy and develop with this money have probably the greatest diversity that could exist even in the present moment. As all I praised the prowess of Rockstar in developing a so great system of customization, your character in Online can look the way you want and what the characters in other games, movies or even real life look like (Jacob Frye, The Joker, mumble rap artists etc), and the clothes full of possibilities can complete the look of these characters. For some players it may be too much freedom, but those who do not have something to do with their time, can witness and even take part in how the Online Los Santos tear itself apart through the explosions of other players or cops who will not stop until they will kill them.\n\nAt the end of the day, Grand Theft Auto V is still a lively and active game thanks to its Online, one of a few masterpieces in the video game industry and a model for other companies that want to achieve these gameplay and multiplayer standards.[/b]\n\n[h1] GTA V Singleplayer Rating: 8/10 [b]Full Shield[/b]\nGTA Online Rating: 9/10 [b]Full Shield[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1551177931, "timestamp_updated": 1551310667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49256213": {"recommendationid": "49256213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131657218", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3039, "last_played": 1551870486}, "language": "english", "review": "This Game is The Legend you will Never ever get game like this If you can afford this then buy and play right now not for story I m pretty sure we all played story mod years ago buy for its online interaction GTAONLINE is whole new game with everything you can imagine and everything you expect from open world online game you will never know this game by watching youtube videos they all are outdated BEST thing about this game is it have regular updates and new contents you will never get boored of online gameplay \n\nOnly one thing i hate about this is its FUCKIN LOADING Literally Rockstar after years of development you guys can't even fix loading time it takes you can't play this game like i have 30mins and lets play GTA out of 30mins 10mins will be its loading jumping sessions to sessions for missions \n\nAnyway this game is worth of 2k rupees and its loading time is also worth after playing 50hours in last 2 weeks \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1551237835, "timestamp_updated": 1551237835, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49383247": {"recommendationid": "49383247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079138369", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 12193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "last_played": 1551714910}, "language": "english", "review": "u can dress up as a squid and go around killing 8 year olds because they blew up your faggio with the the cannon on the tank that they bought with their parents credit card. and there's golf!!!", "timestamp_created": 1551817599, "timestamp_updated": 1551817599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530516445636749268", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48947118": {"recommendationid": "48947118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045264831", "num_games_owned": 457, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 3985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519089158}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want to play singleplayer it's good.\n\nOnline I'd avoid.

Granted, the single player is amazing, and the world building, the graphics, the audio and the utter vibrancy of Los Santos in the single player are far beyond even my highest expectations. Despite this single player experience, the game was distributed without a large part of its content included.\n\nTo make matters worse, Rockstar have done little to improve upon this. While yes, the online mode was eventually released, it was not only a shell of what was expected, but was an echo of the single player mode, where the team behind it went so far as to release the online mode with similar issues to that of the initial launch. The most notable example of this is, once again, missing promised content. Heists, a source of massive hype and element of the game that had amazing potential, were no where to be found. Quite a few pitiful excuses for \"DLC\" were released before Rockstar even mumbled the word \"Heist\" again, and when they eventually got around to it, they came up with five minimalistic-at-best, embellished missions that do not offer a fair reward for one's time.\n\nWhile the world we were allowed to explore in the single player mode felt immeasureably smaller despite existing in the exact same space, it was also missing much of the uniqueness and vibrancy that could be found in Los Santos and its northern neighbors in the single player. \n\nWhile these are only a few issues I find with the game, and focus towards the early days of the game's release, the fact that these issues are still pertinent is what makes the \"Labor of Love\" award so terribly undeserved. There are other issues to regard, such as the fact that all the development this game has seen in 2018 is less than laughable, and (when taking \"Labor of Love\" a bit more seriously) the point that this game has become so much less than a passion project. Whatever the team felt whenever making this game, it has since been buried under a mountain of micro-transactions and money-making \"development\" that can't even compete with the modifications that smaller teams are able to make. The same modifications that Rockstar refuse to allow to flourish, and have since stamped out, further shortening the lifespan of this once promising product.\n\nOf course, the game does have its fun moments, but no where near enough to justify any of the Steam Awards of 2018, especially not the \"Labor of Love\" award. Of course, the award is meaningless compared to the above issues, however it was the target of this review as it is what has motivated me to write it.\n\nTLDR; Thank you for coming to my TED Talk, fix your shit Rockstar.", "timestamp_created": 1549836270, "timestamp_updated": 1549836270, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499510616064071655", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49072352": {"recommendationid": "49072352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281992469", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1551303458}, "language": "english", "review": "I recommend for story mode so many hours of just fun but when it comes to online everyones a head of you and there isnt much space to grow because of modders and microtransactions", "timestamp_created": 1550495493, "timestamp_updated": 1550495493, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503111779689788818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49302697": {"recommendationid": "49302697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035666405", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1635, "last_played": 1551874335}, "language": "english", "review": "Post purchase you are forced to make an account for Rockstar's \"social club\" and agree to 5+ terms of service. fucking fucks", "timestamp_created": 1551475781, "timestamp_updated": 1551475781, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520792067050933838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48884764": {"recommendationid": "48884764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106915580", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 41362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549209540}, "language": "english", "review": "Good story.

Although I do agree with some of the critical comments I also believe that plenty of players are picturing things way too negatively. There's more to this game than some realize...\n\n[*] [h1] Don't buy it for single player alone! [/h1]\n\nDon't get me wrong: the story mode is definitely enjoyable, you'll be taken into an adventure and see how easy it can be to fall into the darker regions of society. Unfortunately though there are three stories rolled into one and as a result the game is lacking some severe character development. Think about it: there are three stories to tell within the length of a regular game play. That simply doesn't work too well, some things feel seriously enforced and don't always add up where storyline is concerned. But... it probably doesn't help that I'm also an invested GTA IV player and that I know where the idea of having three main characters came from. In my opinion GTA IV did it better ;)\n\nBut the main problem with the story mode is that it's trying to tell a story but due to the somewhat rushed method it also feels rushed and doesn't always leave you with that sense of satisfaction you should be getting after having accomplished something. One of the main reasons is that there's little to accomplish. After all: all three main characters are already established within the city, so from a storyline point of view there's usually nothing more to achieve.\n\nUnfortunately it also doesn't help that R* didn't bother to add anything which could account for that. Although you can buy properties which should give you new random missions to do the problem is that they're so expensive that you'll never be able to make enough money during the single player campaign. That doesn't help at all for getting that satisfying feel of accomplishing something. The main reason for this also doesn't help: you won't get paid for most major missions (\"heists\") because you're basically trying to raise funds in order to get something done... for other involved parties. And the three main protagonists just see it through and let it happen without doing anything about it. See, all those missions usually require plenty of shooting, and ammo isn't free. So the little money you do make will probably be spend on ammo, better weapons and protection (body armor).\n\nBasically it boils down to the open world being truly amazing. But the missions and the way they've been set up often not so much. Lineair, bad AI and often predictable.\n\n[*] [h1] Grand Theft Auto Online [/h1]\n\nFor me GTAO provides everything which GTA story mode (single player) is lacking: a chance to truly accomplish something and get some satisfaction out of the game. The main problem though is that GTAO is a non-forgiving environment and if you make a (costly) mistake and put your money into stuff which doesn't pay out then you might end up having a hard time. In other words: if you spend all your money on getting every car in the game then you obviously won't have enough left to invest in things which could help you to make even more money. Which you're going to need if you also want to upgrade those cars as well...\n\nBut in all fairness it also doesn't help that once again R* doesn't put much attention into storyline and gameplay and are basically only pushing their own agendas forward. A good example of that can be seen if you're new to the game: you get constantly bombarded with plees to buy into high end equipment which you really won't be able to afford for a long period to come. But strangely enough you won't get any calls about the availability of missions which can help you progress further into the game. I've been playing for 70 or so hours now and I've only got 1 call from Gerald (for a contact mission) and got 1 car repo request from Simeon. That's plain out bad for the new player experience!\n\n[*] [h1] And about those modders and hackers? [/h1]\n\nQuestion... You spend hours on filling up a warehouse and finally managed to reach a value of around one million GTA$. This is going to seriously push you up the ladder and will help you to buy all those cool things you've been aiming for. Unfortunately during the delivery mission you get attacked by one or more other player(s) and they destroy your cargo with ease. Goodbye investments, goodbye 1 million GTA$... all gone \"just like that\". So is that other player simply really good in playing the game, just a plain out jerk or was this too easy for them so he obviously had to be a hacker?\n\nI'm heavily invested in this game. Up to a point where I also roleplay. When my (female) avatar finds herself in a mission which requires to go on a boat she'll hop into her swimsuit. I can't tell you how many times players accused me of being a hacker merely because I changed my clothes during missions. Even though this is a fully legitimate option provided by the game itself! It gets worse... You can eat snacks and items during missions which can help you restore health. Now, this doesn't happen very often anymore, but I've also been often accused of being a cheater simply because I used snacks to boost my health in order to complete a mission (when other players die during a contact mission they get to spectate the others, it wouldn't be the first time where I was the last one left and managed to finish the mission on my own).\n\nOf course that's not saying that there aren't any problems. But it's also hardly as bad as some people want to make you believe. Especially because there's plenty which you can do yourself to avoid issues. For example: see (or hear) people talk about hacks in your session? Then why not do the smart thing and find yourself another session to play in? Or maybe you don't enjoy multiplayer at all? Well, there are also plenty of solutions for that. The so called 'public solo sessions' if you want to do CEO missions or the down to earth friends or invite -only sessions.\n\n[*] [h1] But I also hear people talk about grinding? [/h1]\n\nYes, if you want to earn some good cash you're going to have to work for it. But if you use some strategy and can have some patience then it really doesn't have to be as bad as some players claim. I haven't timed myself yet, but I can roughly make around 150 - 200k per hour. Let's do this safe and say 1,5 hours. So if you play for 1,5 hour every evening you will have gained yourself 1 million at the end of the week. And that's without using any of the more enhanced ways of making money; such as the import/export business (stealing & selling cars), coke business (= best paying MC business) and fully utilizing the bunker (weapon selling). At the time of writing I'm working hard to get a vehicle warehouse for the import/export missions.\n\n[*] [h1] GTA 5 is what you make of it! [/h1]\n\nSeriously... in a way I sometimes compare GTA 5 to Minecraft. Yes, I know i'm crazy ;) But it's true: in the overall it all boils down to you making your own game. Devise your own strategies, plan your own route in earning some solid cash. And do try to have some fun while doing that!\n\nAnd if you don't succeed on your own try making friends.

If you are familiar with Rockstar's work, you pretty much already know if you're going to enjoy another title of their's or not. I for one love this game and highly recommend it. The single-player campaign is cheesy, tongue-in-cheek fun. Some of the social commentary hasn't aged all that well (though to be fair, when does it), and it is not as deep or engaging as other stories under Rockstar's belt. It feels a bit lazy, convenient, and fake. The story lacks any genuine emotion, which might be a joke that it is set in a notoriously fake environment akin to Los Angeles, but why sacrifice a good story for a meta joke? Aside from that, it's still funny and grand.\n\nThe online mode has many critiques from me. Cheaters and griefers are lame and unwelcome. Some of the gameplay feels a bit repetitive, the eceonomy is a bit unbalanced, and sometimes the servers feel unreliable. That being said, I still have fun with it in a controlled environment. It isn't as hard to make money as it once was, so in due time you'll be able to achieve your online empire (if you have the time to play, that is). If you're on a tight schedule in life and can't afford to grind, I recommend staying away unless you don't see a problem with the microtransactions. That's all personal taste, I won't judge you. The free content added over the years keeps it exciting enough for me.\n\nI highly recommend Grand Theft Auto V.

Although I do agree with some of the critical comments I also believe that plenty of players are picturing things way too negatively. There's more to this game than some realize...\n\nDon't buy it for single player alone!\n\nDon't get me wrong: the story mode is definitely enjoyable, you'll be taken into an adventure and see how easy it can be to fall into the darker regions of society. Unfortunately though there are three stories rolled into one and as a result the game is lacking some severe character development. Think about it: there are three stories to tell within the length of a regular game play. That simply doesn't work too well, some things feel seriously enforced and don't always add up where storyline is concerned. But... it probably doesn't help that I'm also an invested GTA IV player and that I know where the idea of having three main characters came from. In my opinion GTA IV did it better ;)\n\nBut the main problem with the story mode is that it's trying to tell a story but due to the somewhat rushed method it also feels rushed and doesn't always leave you with that sense of satisfaction you should be getting after having accomplished something. One of the main reasons is that there's little to accomplish. After all: all three main characters are already established within the city, so from a storyline point of view there's usually nothing more to achieve.\n\nUnfortunately it also doesn't help that R* didn't bother to add anything which could account for that. Although you can buy properties which should give you new random missions to do the problem is that they're so expensive that you'll never be able to make enough money during the single player campaign. That doesn't help at all for getting that satisfying feel of accomplishing something. The main reason for this also doesn't help: you won't get paid for most major missions (\"heists\") because you're basically trying to raise funds in order to get something done... for other involved parties. And the three main protagonists just see it through and let it happen without doing anything about it. See, all those missions usually require plenty of shooting, and ammo isn't free. So the little money you do make will probably be spend on ammo, better weapons and protection (body armor).\n\nBasically it boils down to the open world being truly amazing. But the missions and the way they've been set up often not so much. Lineair, bad AI and often predictable.\n\nGrand Theft Auto Online\n\nFor me GTAO provides everything which GTA story mode (single player) is lacking: a chance to truly accomplish something and get some satisfaction out of the game. The main problem though is that GTAO is a non-forgiving environment and if you make a (costly) mistake and put your money into stuff which doesn't pay out then you might end up having a hard time. In other words: if you spend all your money on getting every car in the game then you obviously won't have enough left to invest in things which could help you to make even more money. Which you're going to need if you also want to upgrade those cars as well...\n\nBut in all fairness it also doesn't help that once again R* doesn't put much attention into storyline and gameplay and are basically only pushing their own agendas forward. A good example of that can be seen if you're new to the game: you get constantly bombarded with plees to buy into high end equipment which you really won't be able to afford for a long period to come. But strangely enough you won't get any calls about the availability of missions which can help you progress further into the game. I've been playing for 70 or so hours now and I've only got 1 call from Gerald (for a contact mission) and got 1 car repo request from Simeon. That's plain out bad for the new player experience!\n\nAnd about those modders and hackers?\n\nQuestion... You spend hours on filling up a warehouse and finally managed to reach a value of around one million GTA$. This is going to seriously push you up the ladder and will help you to buy all those cool things you've been aiming for. Unfortunately during the delivery mission you get attacked by one or more other player(s) and they destroy your cargo with ease. Goodbye investments, goodbye 1 million GTA$... all gone \"just like that\". So is that other player simply really good in playing the game, just a plain out jerk or was this too easy for them so he obviously had to be a hacker?\n\nI'm heavily invested in this game. Up to a point where I also roleplay. When my (female) avatar finds herself in a mission which requires to go on a boat she'll hop into her swimsuit. I can't tell you how many times players accused me of being a hacker merely because I changed my clothes during missions. Even though this is a fully legitimate option provided by the game itself! It gets worse... You can eat snacks and items during missions which can help you restore health. Now, this doesn't happen very often anymore, but I've also been often accused of being a cheater simply because I used snacks to boost my health in order to complete a mission (when other players die during a contact mission they get to spectate the others, it wouldn't be the first time where I was the last one left and managed to finish the mission on my own).\n\nOf course that's not saying that there aren't any problems. But it's also hardly as bad as some people want to make you believe. Especially because there's plenty which you can do yourself to avoid issues. For example: see (or hear) people talk about hacks in your session? Then why not do the smart thing and find yourself another session to play in? Or maybe you don't enjoy multiplayer at all? Well, there are also plenty of solutions for that. The so called 'public solo sessions' if you want to do CEO missions or the down to earth friends or invite -only sessions.\n\nBut I also hear people talk about grinding?\n\nYes, if you want to earn some good cash you're going to have to work for it. But if you use some strategy and can have some patience then it really doesn't have to be as bad as some players claim. I haven't timed myself yet, but I can roughly make around 150 - 200k per hour. Let's do this safe and say 1,5 hours. So if you play for 1,5 hour every evening you will have gained yourself 1 million at the end of the week. And that's without using any of the more enhanced ways of making money; such as the import/export business (stealing & selling cars), coke business (= best paying MC business) and fully utilizing the bunker (weapon selling). At the time of writing I'm working hard to get a vehicle warehouse for the import/export missions.\n\nGTA 5 is what you make of it!\n\nSeriously... in a way I sometimes compare GTA 5 to Minecraft. Yes, I know i'm crazy ;) But it's true: in the overall it all boils down to you making your own game. Devise your own strategies, plan your own route in earning some solid cash. And do try to have some fun while doing that!\n\nAnd if you don't succeed on your own try making friends.

Buying on sale for the single player even if you never go online.... worth it.\n\n\n\nGTA V Online.\n\nWell, where do I start.  The online part of the game leaves you rattling round in public lobbies trying to grind away the cash to buy anything fun, then more stuff comes out that looks fun and you spend more time grinding for that.  Commonly griefed while doing it, often hassled by modders and frequently stuck in the clouds. \n\nOf course there is stuff like the pvp arenas, all the racing types and heists that can be done without joining a crew as well.\n\nBut, find a good crew..... and all that changes.  With a good crew you can help each other make money, kick the griefers out of sessions, roleplay a motorcycle gang riding around in leather and the game becomes a lot better.  Like most online games, finding decent people to play online with makes all the difference.\n\n\n\nRockstar Support\n\nNo review of GTA would be complete without a quick look at R* support.  Yes the online game has a modder problem, so yes a fairly aggressive anti-cheat is welcome...... regrettably it sometimes functions like a rabid dog and bites whoever it sees.... and from late on 24th to 26th March 2018 it bit a lot. \n\n24th - A bit of code is updated, thousands of people start getting banned for 30 and accounts wiped.\n\n25th - The bans continue, thousands and thousands of bans and accounts wiped, thousands of hours of gameplay gone.  No word from R* about it, support tickets relating to bans autoclosed with a polite \"f**k off reply\"\n\n26th - Bit of code changed on 24th changed back, no word from R*, media gets hold of it, steam reviews tanked.  No new bans\n\n28th - People still banned, no word from R*, support tickets relating to bans no longer autoclosed.  So yeah, that's progress.\n\n29th - So R* has started lifting the false bans, which is great, the downside, when they log in they are getting autobanned again.  The mess continues.\n\nSo finally, about a week after people got banned, and unbanned and banned again everything is getting sorted out.  I was lucky, I got told what was happening so I didn't log in.\n\nNow a lot of people say \"cheaters always whine about getting banned hahahahaha\", but these are people I play with every day, in a crew specifically focused on avoiding cheaters, people I trust in a crew I trust.\n\nGTA is a genuinely great game at times, frustrating at others, and a miserable piece of shit when you have to try dealing with R* themselves.\n\nSingle player 10/10\n\nOnline 5/10 rising to 8/10 with a decent crew.\n\nSupport and respect for their customers 0/10, nothing, nada, f**k all.", "timestamp_created": 1521900904, "timestamp_updated": 1522622886, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 490, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.932515382766723633", "comment_count": 32, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43885020": {"recommendationid": "43885020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029193709", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 59964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1239, "last_played": 1551736922}, "language": "english", "review": "Rockstar can ban suspend/ban your account and completely reset your stats without any warning even when you have no used any mods, picked up modded cash or downloaded a cheat.

Mods that allowed you to do fun things in the single player like spawning in jets or turning yourself into Homer Simpson and driving his car around or enabling moon gravity. I say WAS because Take-Two issued a cease and desist to the mod author. The mod author couldn't fight it, so they stopped distribution of Open IV.\n\n  The likely reason Take-Two killed this mod that only affects the single player is because there are vehicles in the (god-awful microtransaction hell) online mode that aren't available in the single player. This mod is used for mods that allow you to spawn those vehicles into the single player. Take-Two dislike this because they want to push people to play the inferior online mode because that's where all the microtransactions are. The online is missing a lot of features from the single player but it's the only place you can pilot the Hydra jet, for example. Oh, you actually want to pilot the Hydra jet? You'll have to grind for cash for days or buy it for real money.\n\n  It's worth noting the single player story for this game is actually great, but the sudden absence of mods is disappointing, the way Take-Two treat it's modding community is disgusting and they way they see their player base is just insulting.

Even if bans are final, this information should be provided to the user so they can rectify the issue. To make it clear, my current temporary suspension is a false-positive to my knowledge. I requested further information regarding the EULA violation from their support team. They chose not to provide infomration on the EULA violation, nor did they provide evidence that my account had violated the EULA. I can not recommend this game because they do not make this information accessible.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nUntil this week I would have recommended GTA V as a great game. It has an enjoyable single player and while the multiplayer is a grind to say the least, Rockstar have made it possible to perform the activities / missions / events with more than four players, which is a common pitfall of most co-operative games. This has given the game replay value, which led to the large number of hours I have played it. Whenever my friends and I needed a game we all were happy to play, GTA V was commonly the choice. I will acknowledge that GTA V itself is a great game to play with friends, and alone. However, on Monday - whilst mid-mission, GTA V's anti-cheat engine handed me out a temporary suspension. Like a broken record, I will say that I do not cheat, exploit, or mod the game, nor do I have any program which is capable of tampering with the games code or memory. \n\nAt the time, I summised that GTA V's cheat engine works using a heurisitc system which looks at the behaviour of programs running in the background. Most likely it looks for programs attempting to inject code, control window handles, or view memory. I am relatively sure that it was my AS Rock tuning utility - which was monitoring sensory data, that is the culprit. I deduced this only from the fact that it was the only program that I had not run while running GTA V over a long period of time. However, I can also deduce that this program would have in no way altered or hindered the GTA V executable, nor its online service. I do not simply want to serve the 30 day suspension (which I am quite happy to do - understand that an anti-cheat engine that analyzes behaviour is bound to misinterpret occasionally) and then find that I am permanently banned. The problem with this game isn't the anti-cheat engine itself. In software engineering of this nature, there is always a tradeoff between false positives and limiting the number of cheats. So many hackers were ruining the game that the developers had make the anti-cheat engine more aggressive - result: more false positives. \n\nThe problem lies in their lack of support and the ignorance that they hold towards this potential tradeoff. I sent a message to support - not asking to appeal the ban (explicitly telling them that I did not wish to appeal), but rather asking for information regarding the violation so that I could determine what caused the issue. The support message was viewed three times according to their \"latest activity\" timer over two days, and then \"Charles\" provided an automated message essentially copy and pasting the same content on their website regarding the issue. This is the problem. Rockstar and Take-Two's line is that \"everyone is banned\" for a reason - and therefore bans are final. If they enforce this, then they should inform the user of the specific violation that occurred. Providing me with an automated message provides me with no information doesn't tell me what set it off your anti-cheat engine. More so, it is an insult to your player base to not provide this information.\n\nFurthermore, there is an issue regarding permanently banning accounts without providing proof of the offense. In particular, in the termination section they state that they will only terminate an accounts service if it violates the code of conduct or if the service itself is terminated by the licensor (i.e. they stop online support for the game). By permanently banning someone (i.e. terminating online services to that registered account), this directly implies that the user must have violated the code of conduct. If they don't provide proof of the infraction, then one should question whether there was even a violation of their services. The burden of proof is on Take-Two or Rockstar to prove that you violated the EULA. If they can't provide the evidence, then there is no proof of a license violation and therefore they are breaking their own EULA. Since the EULA is essentially a contract, they are legally liable in this scenario.\n\nIf the game provided proof of the violation that the registered account made against the EULA, then I would recommend this game - because then the game/service/or support would explicitly state the violation to the user and give the user a chance to seek remedy in the scenario that the grounds for the violation were false. As it is, Rockstar, Take-Two, nor their support channels make no attempt to provide this information. Furthermore, the support channels they provide for EULA violations (i.e. bans) provides no further assistance in the issue - why have it at all? Just tell us that you don't answer questions on bans rather than wasting our time. So as it stands, I will not be utilising their online services until they do provide this information. Hence, I do not recommend this game because at this time, I can not fully utilise the product without risk of the Licensor (Take-Two) violating the conditions of their EULA in the termination section (i.e. permanently banning me) and with no possiblity of the Licensee (Me) seeking appeal or remedy.", "timestamp_created": 1528516297, "timestamp_updated": 1531085549, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 419, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.906714141368865967", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31826196": {"recommendationid": "31826196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021054472", "num_games_owned": 1040, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 24083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1296, "last_played": 1551597499}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright listen, as much as I love the Grand Theft Auto series, and even though I enjoy this game a lot..... I can honestly say with full confidence this game is the epitome of every disease you can think of. The online mode is where this game really shines (or WOULD shine) other than the blockbuster-like story in single player mode, and crazy Trevor of course. But see, that's just the problem..... everybody plays the online mode, but it's so terrible, the community is toxic as f*ck, and the loading screens... for f*cks sake. Hold on, Let me create this list of bullsh*t for you real quick:\n\n1. Loading screens take forever.\n\n2. One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen, literally feels like you're playing with 9 year old kids. Not even joking.\n\n3. Bored players who will constantly f*ck with you and ruin your fun so that you can't get anything done.\n\n4. Everything is EXPENSIVE as all hell and it's extremely time consuming to make money, and you can hardly even do that without d*ckheads constantly trying to kill you and blow up your product, which is really stupid because they don't really get much of a reward out of it at all, so it further proves that they just do it to be a d*ck.\n\n5. There are HACKERS literally EVERYWHERE in this game, and they will do crazy sh*t such as spawn a ton of money in your account for no reason (which can apparently get you banned, how f*cking retarded is that?) or spawn all the players on the map onto a roof top and then blow them all up with a missile.They give ZERO f*cks, and are quite annoying.\n\n6. The f*cking loading screens X___X\n\n7. You can play a Solo session, or with your friends only.... but you're not allowed to do any actual CEO or MC club work, etc without being in a public session full of d*ckheads, which makes money making almost impossible when you got mother f*ckers flying around in jets trolling everyone, blowing your sh*t up.\n\n8. You have to constantly jump from session to session, in hopes that you'll get away from said d*ckheads and can actually get some sh*t done in peace.\n\n9. And I mean the community is so toxic, I've never seen so much hostility and name calling in a video game in my life, jesus christ.......... nobody gives a f*ck about anybody or anything in this game. I mean yeah it's GTA, but the people on here get a bit ridiculous most of the time I'll be honest.\n\n10. It doesn't matter how big your gang/ crew is, all it takes is one d*ckhead with a rocket launcher or a jet to blow up your plane or truck full of cargo worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that you wasted half your f*cking day trying to make. \n\n11. I'm sure there's a couple more things I missed on this list of bullsh*t but whatever.\n\n12. This game almost drove me to the edge of insanity. I'm 27 years old, I don't need this bullsh*t right now, I need to take a break lol.\n\n13. I'll come back to it some other time, but if you, the person reading this, plans on buying it and trying it out for the online mode...... then be prepared for all the bullsh*t I just talked about, unless of course you're just some bored 11 year old turd (or grown man for all I know) that wants to get on and troll people, then by all means go right ahead, if that makes you feel better about your life.\n\n14. Oh wait, the heists..... man f*ck heists, I'm not waiting 10 years (literally) for players that are level 587 to join the lobby only to suck a** anyways and fail the heists every single time. It's bad enough low level players do which is to be expected, but man when you're that high of a level.... c'mon now.

Some people want the instant gratification that comes with mods and modded money, but  for me, that would just help kill the game even more for cause then it begs the question, \"Why bother playing this game in the first place?\" You can get literally anything and everything you want at the push of a button and at no effort on your part other than a Google search. I don't like cheating and modding cause it feels dirty and wrong. Hell, I don't even really use mods in single player games till I've beaten the story to try and get the full experience of the game before going back and seeing what I missed, other options and choices if possible, or just seeing how badly I can break the game. But only in single player games where I'm not messing with other people's experiences, cause I'd honestly hate for someone to do the same to me in return.\n\nThat's just my stance on it, I know some people are gonna laugh and scoff at it, but I just thought I'd put this out there. Thanks for talking your time to read this, or at least skim over it.\n\nTL;DR \nSingleplayer is fun and enjoyable as long as the next update doesn't keep resetting your progress.\n\nOnline is a battlefield and everyone and their mother will try to kill you. Play at your own risk. Money is gonna be a constant grind to get cause of how overpriced the fun stuff is, but in lobbies, you're probably gonna get blown up no matter what you do. There's ways to make solo lobbies.

There weren't that many cheaters around, Rockstar weren't pushing their shark cards so hard yet. The amount of money needed to get something was considerate. Like top apartments were $200'000, cars cost hardly over $500'000 and you could easily get your first million simply by playing each heist just one time.\n\nThen bikers came out introducing new ways of making money with biker businesses. Which were then greately nerfed after a while. Rockstar began to push their shark cards harder and began to fight the competition they themselves made. That was the first time I noticed Rockstar being greedy and cutting players' income to make it harder for them to grind the money in game making them feel like they need to invest real $$ to get some in-game $$.\n\nAfter that CEO import\\export with crates and stolen vehicles came out which, again, at first allowed players to earn some nice money pretty fast. And guess what happened next? Rockstar nerfed the income yet again making it hardly profitable for the players. And at the same time the prices kept growing wild. Like some cars costing over $2'000'000, apartments costing over 1 milion providing no extra features. Hardly useful mobile operation centers costing 1.5-2 million. And shark cards popping up everywhere like a real annoying advertisement in real life.\n\nThen in June 2017 Gunrunning came out which was a blast in moneymaking compared to any previous activities and remained the best way to make money in GTA Online for a while. At last I was able to keep up with crazy prices on cars, bikes, guns, and all sorts of customization in game (still taking up insane amount of time to grind though, but at least \"the price was right\")\nThat remained the case up untill late february \\ early march of 2018, when I noticed my sales shrank in half. And this time, since it happened recently, I am able to state some real numbers:\nFor a year I was able to pay $75'000 to get a full stock of supplies for my bunker. Which then produced me an amout of guns worth of $420'000 per one sale using a single vehicle. Meaning I had a net profit of $345'000 per one single sale playing solo. And as of today the numbers shrank down to just $210'000 per sale, but I still have to pay the same $75'000 for the supplies and wait for the same amount of time for these weapons to manufacture which makes my net profit $135'000 (down from $345'000). That's $210'000 less than it used to be PER ONE SALE.\nThe exact same thing happened to EVERY DLC activities earlier. I just can't memorize the exact diffirence in numbers for those older changes, but the effect was the same every time. I stopped doing these older missions since they became hardly profitable. And this time the gunrunning is gonna be my next abandoned facility :(\n\nNow let's move on to another huge problem of this game: CHEATERS.\nRockstar made only one good attempt in fighting modders for real. JUST ONCE. When they decided to completely prohibit the use of any modification for GTA Online, which then resulted in a huge outbreak of negative reviews on Steam which spooked Rockstar to the bone. And they quickly reverted these changes completely removing such protection within a couple days. Allowing r\u0435t\u0430rd\u0435d individuals to keep on griefing on other players using mods.\nAnd nothing has changed ever since.\n\nThis is why I AM NOT GOING TO BUY and DO NOT RECOMEND you to buy ANY GAMES FROM ROCKSTAR in the future.\nRockstar used to be a great company making masterpiece games. But they became corrupted by these filthy greedy marketologists, and began to penalize their loyal and honest players with income cuts, crazy in-game prices and long grind times while allowing cheaters and modders to thrive on, completely ruining GTA Online.\n\nROCKSTAR, STOP BEING GREEDY AND MAKE YOUR GAME GREAT AGAIN!", "timestamp_created": 1520889316, "timestamp_updated": 1520942426, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1086, "votes_funny": 47, "weighted_vote_score": "0.918470442295074463", "comment_count": 64, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32441770": {"recommendationid": "32441770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061580972", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486352533}, "language": "english", "review": "I cannot recommend any game that attacks and spits on it's community like Take-Two has with this recent assault on mods.

I had decided to set myself goal of earning enough money through CEO Jobs and Biker Work to buy a Super Yacht. After a few days of grinding I logged on and found I had been banned. I checked my email and found an agressively vague non-specific email telling me I had violated Rockstars EULA and I had been banned from GTAOnline for one month.\n\nAt first I was fairly okay with this, it was one month, and sometimes these things happen. Then I found out that I had my character stats, profile, money and assets wiped out. So I left a ticket on Rockstar social club querying this and attemping to appeal the ban and got back a generic reply that I had violated the EULA and the ban is final. \n\nI have spent the last month sending in tickets, asking different questions trying to at the very least pinpoint what my violation of the terms of service was. I have yet to recieve anything except identical replies, all giving me the exact same vague information that I had violated the EULA and had been banned and that all bans were final. I tried calling up Rockstar technical support (which I only found the phone number for my country on Reddit - thanks to who ever posted that), and the person on the phone read me the EXACT same reply I got by email and then proceeded to hang up. \n\nAt the very least Rockstar has some horrible customer service. At worst, they are deliberately obstructing and willfully ignoring the compaints of paying customers. No automated ban system is flawless, and prior to this I would have agreed that people claiming false bans are just whining cheaters. But now I believe that there is at least a minority of banned players who have been banned for no valid reason, have had hours upon hours of gameplay wiped and have no recourse to appeal the bans. There are victory stories from before Rockstar updated their ban policy mid-2016 when people had been able to appeal the bans due to false-positives, and this at least shows that the automated ban system is flawed. \n\nLet me be clear: I couldn't even find out what I did to earn the ban, let alone be given the chance to refute it.\n \n[b]Overall:[/b]\nSo: if you want this game for singleplayer, go for it. It's good. Story isn't as tight as GTAIV but the gameplay has improved greatly. But if you want to buy GTAV for Online only, think twice; because you may end up having hundreds of invested hours wiped out for no apparent reason, and have no way to even appeal or find out why.\n\n[b]Edit:[/b]\nSome links. \n\n[url=https://youtu.be/J1G7aVdDw7w]YouTube streamer banned, while in game, after streaming from character creation to ban.[/url]\n\n[url=https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002802927]Rockstar come out and say that software hook-ins don't affect bans.[/url]\n\n [url=https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/229514247-Update-to-GTA-Online-Suspension-and-Ban-Policy]Rockstar suspension policy.[/url]\n\n[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV/comments/5aqrfh/falsely_banned_in_gta_online_my_experience_with/]A Redditors ban story.

It's fun in theory but the way Rockstar handles stuff is just awful. Not only are they completely helpless with the cheater situation in the game but their attempts to stop them actually hit legit players as well. I've earned quite a good amount of in game cash during one of their double money weeks shortly before the last major DLC hit and Rockstar in an attempt to remove cheated/modded money removed 7 million (thats the equivalent of about 80 real life bucks) from my account. In-game money I had earned through their event. I've contacted the support multiple times only to receive responses that either claimed the money was cheated or threatened to ban me.\n\nAfter about 5 support tickets I gave up. Rockstar Games is scamming their own customers, and that's why I can't recommend being a customer of Rockstar Games anymore. If you already have the game and still play GTA Online I'd recommend doing the following: Go online and search for a cheater willing to give you modded money, proceed to get as much modded money as possible and spend as much of it as you can.

I think theifs is the best way to describe these companies. I can confirm to those of you reading these reviews saying \"surely they wouldn't be removing in game funds that people pay $80/\u00a360+ for?\" that it is really happening. I will split this review into two parts; Single Player and Multiplayer.\n\n[u] Singleplayer\t[/u]\nThe story and how it plays out for single player is possibly the best out there. The story is fantasic, and there are very few missions that aren't fun to play. Also, the implementation of an in-game stock market (although not the best thing ever) is really cool to me. Pairing this with missions that allow you to manipulate this stock market, you can earn millions, even billions. But this leads to the issue of there being nothing to spend it on. Singleplayer mode for some reason does not get content from Rockstar's updates. The only way you can access them is by grinding multiplayer for days to afford the likes of one car, however we will get to that. \nOverall, Singleplayer is absolutely fantastic, except from the fact that after the story there is little to do unless you are interested in mods, in which case you will probably love this game for that.\n\n[u] Multiplayer\t[/u]\n\nOh yay, this train wreck. Okay, so I have 1,151 hours on Steam for GTA V, with around 1,000 being for multiplayer. I converted my stats from PS3 so likely have around double that. I know what I am talking about with this game. The multiplayer in this game is absolutely trash now. I was always able to look past the grind in this game, but it has gotten to the point now where money is so hard to make, and things are so expensive that it is no longer fun. At all. Rockstar and Take-Two have become money whores, so much so that they are taking purchased in-funds away for NO REASON and will accuse you of hacking the game. If you refuse to purchase the in-game currency (like me), then you will have to grind. Now, at least in my ways, around 1 hour of in game grinding will bring in, at most, around $300,000, and that's if youre grinding really hard, non stop, and have the most lucrative in game businesses in the game. When starting out, you will be lucky to bring in $100,000 per hour, so as you can see, it's a pretty tough grind anyway. The last update called \"Smuggler's Run\" brought some of the most expensive content in GTA Online to date, with things costing $1,500,000 upwards. I had 2.6 million removed from an in-game challenge called Criminal Mastermind that took me months to complete, getting $10,000,000 from. This was removed because it was \"modded or cheated money\". So, 6 tickets to Rockstar later, I have quite rudely been told by a robot to go fuck myself and that I'm not getting it back, and that's why I've finally decided that enough is enough with this game.\nSomething that I have always found interesting in GTA Online is that you can buy a yacht - a real calling card, with the most expensive one sitting at $10,000,000. The highest in-game currency you can purchase is $8,000,000, sitting at $100 real money. That to me has always seemed ridiculous for what is already a fairly expensive game.\nAlso, if you want to mod singleplayer, thats fine in their eyes (not really since they shut down OpenIV, a company they supported but hey let's let bygones be bygones), but if you DARE go near their money making method and try to make things fun, you will be banned and stripped of everything you have online.\n\n[u] Overall\t[/u]\nThis review could go on forever, about a game/company that steals from their fans and shuts down companies who they once directed their fans to, but I think it's time to sum it up. For what was for a very long time my favourite game ever, I would highly recommend that you never go near this game, even if you recieve it for free. I will never touch another Rockstar or Take-Two game, and hope that their next game flops and they learn no treat their fans better, however, if you're not giving them money, they hope you fuck yourself.\n\nUpdate: Went on today to see if I had been refunded yet, and guess what!! I haven't.\n\nUpdate 2: Left another ticket  to Rockstar asking HOW my money was illegitamate, stating several times that I know that it, according to them, is illegitimate but after my ticket making it to support stage 3 (presumably the highest?

Great game. Came back on to have some fun with an old friend and to check out the new updates. We did some CEO missions and drove around, deciding not to bother the other players and do our own thing. I log off the game. Five minutes later i receive an email stating i have violated the EULA and my account, character, and inventory have all been reset. Years of work. Gone. I decided to give the game another chance after the same scenario had happened to my best friend before the reset was a thing, just to have it happen to me. Don't get me wrong, we had a blast driving around, grinding up enough money to finally buy the vehicles and homes we wanted, then proceed to try the new modes as they came out like the racing, CEO, adversary modes. I saw all these negative reviews on the page stating how people had been randomly banned, and when they brought this up on the forums, they were called \"liars\" and told \"Dont cheat again fgt\". I thought they were full of shit until it happened to me. I have no chance of getting all i've worked for back unless i buy their damn shark cards, and even then, whos to say they wont ban me again? I can say the uninstall button worked better than the anti-cheat, as ive seen countless modders roaming around unopposed, causing hell to other players. Im 90% sure that the majority of answers im going to get for this review are going to be the \"regulars\" who claim everyone hacks or cheats except them, and that i won't be missed. Thats fine.

I think I have a good idea of what it's like.\nI'd also like to list my PC specs now and what they were when I originally bought the game.\nCPU: Core i7 7700K   (Was Core i7 6700K)\nGPU: MSI GTX 1070 (8GB)   (Was EVGA GTX 960 (2GB))\nRAM: 8GB, Dual-channel DDR4 @2400MHz (Was 8GB, Dual-channel DDR4 @2133MHz)\nI play the game at 1080p with 'Very High' settings. (Was High-Very high settings)\n\n[b] Singleplayer & Mods [/b]\n\n   I bought this game a while back. Enjoyed the singleplayer until I finished it. Once the story was finished, the endgame was boring with nothing left to do but install mods. As of recently, Take-Two Interactive ordered a Cease and Desist for the popular modding tool OpenIV, essentially gutting the GTA modding scene. This is unfortunate because without mods the singleplayer endgame is pretty boring.\n\n[b] Online [/b]\n\n   GTA Online is arguably the biggest selling point of GTA V. I'd like to say I enjoy it but I don't.  Everything in GTA Online is purposefully tedious for the sake of making microtransactions viable it seems. Servers are either mostly empty or full of script kiddies. On the off-chance you do get into a mostly full server, you'd better be prepared to be killed repeatedly by players who spent hundreds of dollars in real money to buy all the best weapons and vehicles. I don't have a problem with microtransactions when they're done right but I don't feel they were done right here.\n   I feel GTA Online is a huge victim of power creep & spectacle creep. [i](Meaning that over the years, new content added has become more powerful and more flashy, making the old content worthless.)[/i]\n\n[b] Graphics, Sound, & Performance [/b]\n\n   Personally I think this game looks great. I did get tired of looking at it after maybe 100 hours and installed an ENB mod. [i](A mod that changes the mostly lighting and shading but sometimes textures to make the game look better)[/i] The sounds are a bit on the weak side for me. I don't know why exactly but the guns just sound dinky and weak to me. The ENB mod I installed fixed this though by replacing the sounds with (IMO) better ones. The game performs well usually with my setup (See top of review). At least 60 FPS in most cases. There has always been a sort of stuttering issue I've had with the game. After visiting many reddit and forum posts I couldn't find a solution to the problem though this issue doesn't seem to happen to everybody.\n\n[b] Story [/b]\n\n   I liked GTA V's story mode. Given that I was a Nintendo child, that doesn't say much. I don't have much else to say about the story. I think most people just bought GTA V for the Online anyway.\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\n\n   GTA V is still entertaining with some mods but with the Cease and Desist for OpenIV [i]{The developer for OpenIV also created Scripthook)[/i] mods may not be an option anymore. The Online experience has been mostly negative and without mods the singleplayer experience gets boring after a while. Overall I don't think I would recommend GTA V.\n\n[b] EDIT (6-19-2017) [/b]\nI'd like to clarify that I do enjoy the singleplayer campaign. It can make for quite an entertaining and even sometimes immersive experience though without mods it does lose a bit of playability towards the endgame, like I mentioned. Personally I won't stop playing the game just because mods are gone but it is still a concern to me.

The story, characters, map. Even after playing over and over again it's still entertaining. I like it way more than the GTA 4's story.\n\n[b]As for online[/b] - this is the reason why I don't recommend the game, because I think that most people nowadays buy the game mainly because of the online. Don't get me wrong; I used to love it, played over 400 hours of pure online, everything was awesome, I thought that this is the perfect multiplayer game, they are constantly updating it and there is a lot of stuff - which has become the problem. A year and a half ago, everything was more or less balanced, the prices were reasonable. After the Import/Export things were getting drastically different. Looked like this to me: \n\n[i]\"Hey buddy, want to enjoy the content? Well, you should get our brand new garage only for 2M.\"[/i]\n\nThen Gunrunning. Again, my overall feelings:\n\n[i]\"Look at this cool update! The players will be able to get their bunkers only for 1.5M. Also, don't forget to upgrade your equipment for another 1M. Did we forget to mention that getting additional people working for you will only cost you half a million? By the way, you will time from time get raided and lose everything, unless you buy another cameras for 400K! All the raids will magically disappear! Want to modify your weapons in your Workshop? Well, too bad, you need a trailer for that, but don't worry, it's only 1 to 2 and a half millions. Do you want to train your shooting? There you go, only for 700K! Do you prefer white over black? The paint costs 105K, so... Did we mention that you can take a nap there? The key for that room costs 265K. Do you want a Gun Locker which you will probably never use? That will be 175K. You want some caddies? 85K or 120K if you want to have them larger. Don't forget to check out the new cars! Get yourself a car that shoots a couple of missiles only for 4-5M!\"[/i]\n\nHow I felt about Smuggler's Run:\n\n[i]Hello there! This update will be about planes. Want a hangar? 1 to 5M. Which style would you prefer? The one for 100k or the one for 320k? Want different lights? No problem - the more expensive style you chose the more expensive lights you'll get! Isn't that cool? Want some nice 'art' on the floor? Sure, we'll paint it for you, costs only up to 200k, just like your apartment you bought last year to do heists! Furniture? You mean another wall? That's another 280k for you. Again, want the keys to access your bed? 235k-375k. You want to customize your 500k glider? One word - WORKSHOP! And guess what this number, 1,150,000 means... Correct! It's the price!\"[/i]\n\nThe prices of the content added were skyrocketing, if you wanted to truly enjoy the game, you had to either make money all day long if you wanted to be a fair dude that doesn't hack, which is by the way, another big problem with this game, or buy some cards that are horribly overpriced. At this point I didn't have time to play all day long, I didn't want to hack and I totally didn't want to spend twice the price of the game on some cards, so I stopped playing. Since then, I've been ignoring the game, not watching any videos and not paying attention to the updates. Sometimes, when I notice that there's an update, I come back for a couple of minutes and look how a vehicle with a couple of missiles costs over 4 millions. Now another heist update, you might think this:\n\n[i]\"Oh, finally another heist, things are getting back to the state when you could buy a house for 200k and get full content.\"[/i]\n\nThe reality, however, looks like this: \n\n[i]\"Hey, it's nice to see you back in the game, look at this brand new heist room only for 2 millions, the same idea, only way more expensive.\"[/i]\n\nAnd as a person who doesn't have that much time to play anymore, I can't enjoy the content anymore. Another problem with this game are the hackers. I finally am thrown into a lobby after 10 minutes of loading, I see that I am immediately teleported to an airport from my house with a couple of other people and I am stuck doing some rather strange animations.

Better still, many of these people with modded money didn't get affected at all!\n\nFirst we are met with a screen during the game's loading cycle stating 'we have determined that GTA$ and/or RP details on your account were adjusted by something out of your control and we have taken action to fix it.  No additional action is required from you at this time.'\n\nNow, a lot of people will try to argue that they are completely legit 'except for that one time when...'  I am not one of these people.  I know what the public sessions are like in this game.  It's because of this that I had only ever played in closed or solo sessions until very recently, with the same one or two known and trusted friends, for most of my online time.  I had never played online on a console and had never transferred an online character.  I routinely took screenshots of my online bank account just in case some modder somehow managed to get through to me and mess with my hard-earned cash.\n\nTo this day I have yet to see a single glitched or modded GTA dollar go into my account.  I would know if it went there.  I do not place myself into situations where such a thing could happen and I keep a very close eye on what happens to my game.  In addition I've never modded nor glitched GTA money, myself.  I've never even duped a car.  Honestly, I don't even know how to do any of this stuff!\n\nRockstar apparently could not care any less about this as they had decided to 'take action' and steal $28,553,333 of my legitimate, hard-earned money.  Right out of the blue, no explanation given.  'Okay,' I think, 'their anti-cheat is confused with the double payouts we've gotten over these last few weeks.  They'll figure it out, this'll get sorted out, everyone who had their legit cash removed will get it back.'  There's quite a lot of us, too.  Look around the forums and message boards.  Tons of us.  Including about ten people whom I've just stared playing with mere days ago, which happens to be most of the people that I know in this game.\n\nSadly, this does not appear to be the case.  Rockstar's support number has a doofy automated thing saying to use their support website (which many of us have already attempted to use.)  Any attempt to mention this stolen money on said website will soon see the issue being flagged as being a 'cheat/exploit or banning issue.'  It may or may not also have an automated response from some soulless bot stating that \"Your shared bank account in GTA Online was adjusted to remove illegitimately gained in-game money.\"  Then the trouble ticket will be closed.  End of story, slap across the face.  'You cheated, we corrected it, get lost.'\n\nLike Hell!  Not ONCE have I EVER done anything in this game to cheat.  I HATE cheating.  Had any modded money been dropped onto me I would have told them about it in a heartbeat.  But Rockstar simply does not care about how legitimate we are.  They are always in the right, we as players are always in the wrong.  I'll probably never see that money back but that doesn't mean I'm going to stop sending them trouble tickets about it.  I'm currently sitting at number four.  They will keep hearing from me until they either fix their error or ban me.\n\nNowhere has there been any official word from them about this.  No 'we recognize that there was an issue' or 'we are currently looking into the matter.'  Nope, we're all dirty cheaters, go screw off somewhere else.  As if it wasn't bad enough that they find any way they can to deplete our online bank accounts through normal play, now they're outright stealing it from a lot of us!\n\nAll of the other rampant bugs in this game, both new and old, I could come to overlook (and there are quite a few of them!)  The increasingly forced public session play, the psychotic AI drivers, the ridiculous AI buffs, being called a 'cocksucker' by the NPC's hundreds of times during play (Rockstar must have a fascination with this word combination,) the list goes on.  I won't even get into the mess that is story mode.\n\nThis matter, however...  Now that I know who I am dealing with I am done purchasing anything with Rockstar's name on it.  Take 2 is in significant danger as well since their name is now associated with this title.  This kind of treatment of their playerbase is beyond unacceptable.  I can't even fathom how much of my time had been lost due to this, though if you consider that their most expensive Shark Card weighs in at $100 USD and gives you 8 million credits then they just stole nearly $357 USD from me because of this nonsense and there isn't anything in the world I can do about it.  (Except for sending them a bunch of trouble tickets and writing a negative review on Steam.  Power to the consumer, gorramit.)\n\nI had worked my butt off in this game for every dollar which I had saved and spent.  I played it smart, made intelligent purchases, played the game the way it was meant to be played and did everything that I could do to protect myself and my belongings.  As it turns out someone did manage to mess up my account in the end, just not how I would have expected.\n\nGrand Theft Auto receives two middle fingers way, way up.  If you've managed to avoid purchasing this game so far, congratulations!  Stay far, far away from it and its rampant toxicity.  If you already have purchased this and happened to experience a similar situation then I strongly encourage you all to join me in avoiding any of their games from this point forward while continuing to contact them through any means possible until they fix their broken crap and give us back our hard-earned money.\n\nSeriously, go sit on a cactus Rockstar.", "timestamp_created": 1504448881, "timestamp_updated": 1504448881, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1038, "votes_funny": 54, "weighted_vote_score": "0.89944380521774292", "comment_count": 56, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34492380": {"recommendationid": "34492380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179527750", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 35541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549657051}, "language": "english", "review": "Your Account Details Have Been Adjusted\n\n-$2225000\n\n(Delete Grand Theft Auto V)", "timestamp_created": 1503704205, "timestamp_updated": 1503704205, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 947, "votes_funny": 159, "weighted_vote_score": "0.885535478591918945", "comment_count": 33, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32427125": {"recommendationid": "32427125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053864545", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 19404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1532189771}, "language": "english", "review": "EDIT: OPENIV has been reinstated, I'm sad that there isn't a mixed option, only a No it's bad and a yes it's good option.\n>I give the game a thumbs up for the single player, only buy the game IF you want single player / only  see multiplayer as a bit of an addon and the single player as the main game.\n>I highly recommend you to stay away from this game if you only want to play multiplayer because the multiplayer is ridden with microtransactions and grindfesting.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nTake Two is killing it's own game since day one, because rather than allow modders to play on a seperate server where they can mod to their will (this made GTA IV en SA succesful and fun to play) you now have to play a shitty, microtransaction riddled and super grindy multiplayer game,  where fun doesn't exist because either someone has a hydra or everyone is just doing the same missions over and over and over again.

(8,000,000 won't even buy you 2% of the multiplayer content, and that's a $100 of actual money). I have never bought a single shark card from you and I never plan to. I've spent hundreds of hours on your game. I've even put up with you canceling single player dlcs and even firing the man, the legend, Leslie Benzies. But now you have taken it way too far. The ONLY reason I bought your game for the PC was so that I could mod it. I wanted to add some more depth to the single player part of GTA5. I could care less about modding online, I just wanted to get some visual graphical improvements and create single player skits using the Rockstar Editor (which you already f*cked up with your limited range camera...). But now since Take Two has made Open IV (a modding tool that was used for 10 years) illegal just so that you can try and get the few remaining people that enjoy single player with mods to try to switch to your sh*tty multiplayer so you can earn some more money.

Just now decided to write a review after seeing the same thing has happened to so many others. \n\nI bought GTAV on [u]September 17th, 2013.[/u] I waited in the pre-order line at gamestop because I was so damn hyped for this game. I was only intending to play it on console until the PC version came out. At this point I had no clue that there was going to be character swaps from console to PC. I obtain level 72 on console. Loving the game, couldn't be happier (except if the radio stations were better).\n\nPC version release date is announced sometime in January 2015. I immediately pre-order it in order to get the bonus money that was available as a pre-order incentive. Upon release I transfer my character from console to PC and recieve my pre-order money. I was so thrilled to finally be playing this great game on PC. In the last year I put in 390 hours online in this game and achieved level 136 if I recall correctly. Countless hours of heist grinding, job grinding, lots of shark cards bought. Sitting at something like 11million dollars. 2 houses, 2 garages. Everything I could ever want in the game. I had things that weren't even obtainable anymore. I was thrilled with where the game was going. Then.... I get bored; So I quit playing for 2 months.\n\nA friend asks me, \"Hey come play GTA with me let's wreck some kids\". Sure why not. I get on for about an hour and we do just that, wreck some kids. I log off for the night and log in the next day to a 10 day ban. I was beyond baffled. How could I be banned when I didn't do anything? Surely rockstar support can help me. So I call in an attempt to figure out what is going on. I get fed a rehearsed line about bans being the result of online modding etc etc. I ask for a supervisor, the supervisor says the same thing. I ask for his supervisor. He says there is no one above him available and I was unable to appeal my ban. His reasons are as follows.\n[list]\n[*]\"Just accept the 10 day ban.\" \n[*]\"If you weren't really doing anything then in 10 days you can play again and nothing will be lost, just take a break\". \n[/list]\nHe neglects to tell me that the system was going to take all of my money and I would have to start over. Grinding countless heists/jobs or buy a large sum shark card (which is ultimately what they wanted me to do).\n\nI come back around 12 days later and play for a few hours. Nothing out of the ordinary happens. I then got off for the night. The following day I got back on and was banned again. This time for 30 days. I think to myself \"No &*%#ing way, this isn't possible\". I call [b]AGAIN[/b] and get the same rehearsed line [b]AGAIN[/b] from both the first and second level of support (always ask for a supervisor). Except this time something was different. This time I was being allowed to appeal my ban. I thought for sure I would be exonerated of these allegations. [b]Nope.[/b] I was told that I must have been hacking if their skynet system banned me. That there is nothing they can do and that \"evidence of illicit activity\" was found on my account. So I ask them to check again and they do. Same result. \n\nAt this point I start thinking ahead. \"What happens when I get back from this 30 day ban?\". \"I'm just going to be banned again for the same false reason?\"\nThey reply, \"that shouldn't happen sir\". I reply, \"Shoulda coulda woulda. It's happened twice now so what makes next time any different. No variables have changed. If I record all of my gameplay from now on will that protect me? If I am indeed banned upon return to your game can I use the footage as proof of my innocence?\"\n\"Yes\", I was told. Not maybe, not \"we're not sure\". I was told [b]\"Yes, that will suffice\".[/b]\nSo I did just that. I recorded all of my gameplay. Unfortunately \"all\" only ended up being roughly 2 hours the night I was unbanned after the 30 day ban because I was immediately banned permanently after logging off for that night.\n\nThis is starting to get a little longer than I expected so I'll cut it short. I tried to appeal the permament ban. I thought \"I have video that I didn't do anything, surely this time it will be different.... they will have to unban me\". [b][u]NOPE.[/u][/b]\nI'll just end my review here and link my evidence. The videos of my gameplay and their final reply to me in my appeal where I linked them the videos. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVEBdTP7X4S3b5VYQEvV7WN_0xNOgAcOQ\nhttp://imgur.com/a/WWIFQ\n\n[b] TL;DR: ROCKSTAR CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS TERRIBLE AND IF YOU BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL BE BANNED BY SKYNET SIMPLY FOR BEING IN THE SAME LOBBY AS A SCRIPTER (WHICH WILL ALWAYS HAPPEN). [/b]\n\nEdit: According to various sources (denied by Rockstar when I called them today) I was banned for MSI Afterburner/RivaTuner. This would make sense to me now that I think about it. However my review remains unchanged because they are doing absolutely nothing to fix the issue. I was told that I am not allowed to appeal my permanent ban because their system is flawless and does not falsely ban people for any reason. The support supervisor (Kyle) even acknowledged that he had heard of the MSI/Riva complaint but that it was \"false\". So yeah I'm still in the same place I started.

This is leading to the banning of innocent players with no reversal appeal, follow up investigation or notice to the player of the offense.\n\nI've been playing Grand Theft Auto Online legit since GTA IV in 2008, I have over 600 hrs of gametime if you include my time on Xbox One.  I loved the whole series since top down.    But in 3D GTA the pay2play is top of the line.  Shark cards really leave you feeling like you were just taken by a shark.  I've spent more money on this game than I'd care to admit.  But I never cared to cheat, hack, mod, whatever.  I played the game legit with my friends and just dabbled time to time after no one played anymore. \n\nNow I can't trust Rockstar at all... because I don't harrass other players or even play with old friends, just by myself every once in a while, but now I'm banned for some mysterious offense without justification or human attention to the situation.  When requesting an explanation I like everyone else with this problem have been met with an automated reply:\n \n\"Hello SensiSoulja,\nThank you for contacting Rockstar Support. GTA Online bans are triggered by a number of factors, including modding in GTA Online, exploiting or abusing game mechanics, manipulating protected game data and code, or otherwise interfering with other players\u2019 gameplay experience.\nAll GTA Online suspension and banning decisions are final and may not be appealed. For more information on the GTA Online Suspension and Ban Policy please see https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/articles/229514247.\nBest regards,\nRockstar Support\"\n\n\nI was playing a game in GTA online setting up my hanger because I haven't played for awhile and needed it for my Akula I bought after selling a bunch of old cars.  My brother gets in the house from work so I went to talk to him for maybe 8 minutes... came back to the game expecting to be kicked for being AFK.   But this time it says I have been suspended til July 1, 2018, if and when I come back my account will be reset... I don't know what happened, but I don't mod, hack, or do any other nefarious activities online at all.   \n\nAfter doing some research I find out apparently there is a newly implemented Anticheat program that they claim is very accurate at detecting hackers, modders, manipulators, and harrassers.  Plenty of posts and videos have been put up on social media about people getting there accounts suspended and wiped, or banned by mistake, with zero appeal policy and no investigations or follow ups.   \n\nNot only will not be buying another game from Rockstar again, but I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND GTA V because the chances of being banned and wiped fraudulently seems inevitable until they fix this glitch in the system.", "timestamp_created": 1527825434, "timestamp_updated": 1529014488, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 734, "votes_funny": 52, "weighted_vote_score": "0.895480930805206299", "comment_count": 47, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32448306": {"recommendationid": "32448306", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071245388", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516963482}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey Rockstar and Take Two!

On about 3/23/18 thousands of accounts were randomly banned. I'm not saying [i]all[/i] of them were innocent, but at least a vocal majority certainly are. And as of writing this, (4/5/18) we [i]still[/i] haven't gotten any sort of proper response, that isn't some generic copy-paste nonsence.\n\nThis new system appears to have been targeting cheaters, but happens to label seeming randomly people as cheaters.\nBut you wanna know what will likely come of wiping the progress of some thousand people's charaters? More cheaters. Because, who realisticly is going to come back after a month, having lost some hundreds  -in some case thousands- of hours, of legit grinding thinking \"well, let's do that ALL over again.\"\n\nAnd don't even get me started on their support policies. If you even MENTION the word \"ban,\" your support ticket is thrown directly into the trash, and given a generic \"bans are triggered by a number of things...\" \"and all bans are final.\" Like, they give this anti-cheat so much credit that \"It can do no wrong\" in their eyes. And you're placing a losing bet if you think they will admit any sort of failure on their end.\n\nOn top of all this, [i]IF[/i] you somehow get a real responce from someone, they can't/won't tell you why you were even banned. This is just plain stupid on many levels. You're just, SUPPOSTED to know what you did wrong and not do it again.\nThis is bullshit. Especially when one of the listed reasons for a ban is \"Disrupting play.\" That's so incredibly vague, they could ban you for just about anything under that label.\n\nIf they're banning for minor exploits/glitches, they have a lot longer list than what was banned. I guerentee at least a third of the community has exploited some glitch one time or another. And if that is so, that's some pretty backwards priorities when you STILL can't go a few hours in freeroam without bumping into a cheater.\n\nThat's all I have to say. I know the general consensus on steam is/was, \"lmao, cheaters BTFO.\" But I still felt the need to get my thoughts out there. And if Rockstar plans to treat their players in RedDead2 with the same respect they do GTAO players, they can just piss off.\n\n[u]Disclaimer:[/u] Yes, I was one of those affected.
