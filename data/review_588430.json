Easy concept with basic management of the vault. There is some questing, leveling, training, impregnating, looting, plus Mr. Handy and Pets. The game is loaded with fallout references and has quite a big load of humor. \nNow, the problem here are small issues and difficulty carve. The deathclaws and radscorpions (btw. seriously? I ware killing those with the spear in original Fallout) are serious challenge. That wouldn't be a problem normally, but the click boxes are not align correctly, and health bar is eaten rapidly (btw. I don't know why but the damage is always much bigger in the larger room then in smaller ones). At the end although player is clicking on the dweller, the stimpacks and rad aways are not always activated, and dwellers die. Again, that wouldn't be a tragic, but like game says itself, rushing rooms is main caps earner (and at some stage radscorpions occur frequently). Sure, one can pass the rushing future, as well as turn the radio for vault broadcasting only, but deathclaws and radscorpions will still come. At earlier stage of the game incidents are somewhat countered with mysterious stranger and \"cap and bottle\", but later with larger vault it is really hard to keep up. This is not only due many floors to be scanned, but also due click boxes problem, as well as positioning. The last one is mainly Mysterious Stranger problem, who likes to show just behind the dweller or in the corners of the room that are not visible from all perspectives. With almost no arrival sound while zoomed out that renders him almost completely obsolete, and reducing him to a \"lucky shoot\" only.\nNow, some people are saying the save future is flawed since it doesn't safe basic resources. Well, if one will study closely the truth is revealed. This is a future not a bug. Mr Handy can collect those while not playing the game, and since those are extremely rare, but can be easily bought up, well it's the player and his/her wallet problem :) \nSpeaking of micro-transaction, generally they are not so bothersome like in other games. Sure Quantum Cola can speed things significantly, and pets, robots and legendaries can improve things significantly but the game is still fun to play without paying.\nSpeaking of I really don't understand Nuka-Cola plant. The description is wrong, as it's not producing Nuka Cola. It looks like it was suppose to produce Quantum Cola at the beginning, but developers found it too powerful and change it for resources. That move makes on the other hand some buildings questionable.\nThe game runs without problems under Steamplay (Linux).", "timestamp_created": 1550275722, "timestamp_updated": 1550276115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589114189147949219", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49066174": {"recommendationid": "49066174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278536362", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550332101}, "language": "english", "review": "Did better than 76, even though that really doesn't mean much.

So get it already. It's free.\n\nThe longer version. A serious warning up front. This game seems like a walk in the park - until it suddenly isn't. You can lose an entire vault, the fruits of months of realtime work, within minutes. So, let's avoid this, or more precisely, let's talk about how to avoid the possibility until you feel able to face the challenge.\n\nResources (energy, water, and food) are produced in production rooms. Rooms need energy, dwellers need water and food. The value of the production room does not give you its actual output. So, 20 dwellers do not need production rooms showing 20 food and water. Instead, every dwellers has skills (in Fallout normally called attributes, \"special\"), and the skill of the dweller in a production defines its output. More skill means more production, even if the room is not upgraded. In consequence, get a feel for what your vault needs by keeping an eye on your resource storage. If it fills up, however slowly, you're peachy.\n\nThis game has clearly defined progressive danger steps. Every tenth dweller adds a new threat (most notable until the 60th). So when you work on getting the feeling for production, I suggest doing so with nine dwellers.\n\nNow that you know how to handle resources, let's go back to the core of the game, rooms need energy. If the energy storage of your vault even once falls below the line on the storage meter, you are in the process of losing your vault. Don't say you weren't warned. The reason why energy is more important than food and water is simply that there is no food and water without energy.\n\nGetting a feeling for resource storage is not rocket science, so the real problem are the dangers. First, on the uppermost level of your vault build your first power room. The dwellers in it need strength for production, which also gives them resilience in a fight. Until you become really good, this is your best line of defense against intruders.\n\nHowever, the true danger is random fires and infestations. With one exception, both fires and infestations do NOT spread diagonally. I am aware that 50 million people ignore this and every \"best vault build\" on the net tells you otherwise, but develop your vault keeping this in mind, and you cannot lose your vault...\n\n... until you willingly and purposefully choose to have your 50th dweller !!!\n\nThe second your vault has fifty dwellers, infestations include radscorpions. They teleport. They not only rot out every dweller they find, they drain your energy storage even while in an empty room. So as long as you are not an expert in the game's mechanics and as long as you do not have the proper equipment, one of two things will happen. The merciful version kills all but three of your 50 dwellers and you may have a chance to start from scratch. Accent on \"may\". The cruel version kills only fifteen, but leaves you with an empty energy storage.\n\nWell then, now that you are spared the nasty surprise, let's talk about the fun factor.  FOS is a blast. Could there be more contents? Sure.  Could some things be done better? You betcha. But FOS has that elusive ingredient, which once upon a time made Sid Meier's Civilization legendary. You start the game to do nothing more than the half hour of maintenance - and then your tummy rumbles, because, hey, you didn't even sip some water in the last eight hours.\n\nOh, one more technical tip. Unlike what the FOS wiki states, a higher Luck skill outside the wault does not give you better items, but more caps. Perception rules item quality in loot.\n\nAt the end, a word about shop items. If you don't buy items on principle, you can stop reading here.\n\nThe starter pack and the lunch boxes contain resources. The game sometimes asks you to collect a certain amount of resources. The ones from the pack and the boxes do not count towards this goal. So, the only obvious use of purchased resources is emergency fill-up after a botched radscorpion infestation. Throwing money at this problem would most certainly help, but given the hit dweller corpses cause to happiness, don't presume it will solve the pronlem all on its own.\n\nThe early value of the pack and the boxes is twofold, skilled dwellers and the chance for a rare or better weapon. A single rare or better weapon in your energy production room guarding the vault entrance makes a huge difference early on. Skilled dwellers before having the rooms to train them yourself are sheer gravy. There is a catch with both, though. \n\nPart of the game's fun is to figure out, which items are worth keeping and which aren't. When you buy boxes, make sure you have the item storage space - and remember, a dweller, who loots the wasteland, may come back with 40 items. \n\nThe catch of skilled dwellers is a little tricky. You want your highest level dweller to roam outside for loot. The starter pack gives you a brutal advantage to this end. However, when you just started, your average vault level will rise significantly with the starter pack. So don't forget to give one of the weapons coming with the pack to your guard room. Raiders are not much of a trouble throughout the game, except this early.\n\nI hope that this short review gives you a fighting chance without the frustration of a vault wipe-out.", "timestamp_created": 1525197222, "timestamp_updated": 1525222565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 81, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.866042971611022949", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31555370": {"recommendationid": "31555370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018483984", "num_games_owned": 1816, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 4441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495261505}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Excellent for the one handed[/h1]\n\nI recently spawned a small human, and have found myself sitting at my PC for hours with one hand available and the other attempting to rock an angry gremlin.

I'm a huge Fallout fan, coming up to 30 and followed the games all the way from the first. I'll likely continue to play only for a short while though -\n\nFallout Shelter could have been so much more. I'm not sure what went wrong at Bethesda, because there's a real gem game hiding underneath the monetisation.\nIt's such a lovely, charming game. The artwork is brilliant, the audio is fantastic, and I like how much you can customise different aspects of your vault. I like that you send your dwellers out into the wastelands, and the logs they record while they're doing it. I played on release on ios as well, but in all honesty it didn't last very long.\n\nThe game is weighed down by microtransactions. I wholeheartedly believe that if this was treated like the single player game it is instead of parroting that crappy model that countless games on the mobile stores follow, if the wait timers were divided by 10 and all of this stupid quantum cola stuff was removed altogether, if questing was fleshed out somewhat and timers were reworked to timers in the range of 1-3 hours, long enough to put down but quick enough to ride through if you kept yourself distracted,  if you had slapped a \u00a317.99 price tag on the front of it, I'd imagine it'd have sold like hot cakes and the reviews would be immeasurably in your favour. You could have added card expansions in the form of paid DLC if you really were looking to squeeze a bit extra and it would have raised a lot less eyebrows.\n\nIf you had slapped it on the ios store like that at \u00a39.99, it would have sat at the top of different mobile site's top charts for years to come. There's very little in the way of deep strategy games on mobile without in app purchases, this probably would have made a mint done the right way with integrity, instead of taking this trashy route that only serves to annoy people into paying money. A Fallout themed strategy game with  no iap that cross synced between my PC and my iPhone? It'd feel like Christmas.\n\nI'd like to imagine that many of the designers were not on board with any of the monetisation stuff and I'd like to believe there's probably a few guys out there that wanted to do something entirely different but had to keep the bosses happy. I feel like this is a good example of what happens when the quest for money interferes too much with a player's experience. You pick these designers up because they are talented people who are passionate about their work and art, let them do their jobs properly!\n\nBethesda in my eyes is respectable when I compare them to other companys in the industry. Get off this road, it leads to ruin. And from a fan's perspective, Fallout deserves better than a honey trap. Shame on you, Bethesda. >:(\n\n\nThe jist of my review is that the content is fantastic, I can't fault it. The problem is the way it's served is questionable and why I have not recommended it. Fallout is a flagship title and holds weight in regards to normalising IAPs in the PC gaming marketplace, and said games are more often than not shady, anyone who is familiar with mobile gaming will understand what I mean. Their design makes it easy to irresponsibly mine money from people in an irresponsible way, and I fear that this title will help make it easier for this price model to become commonplace.\n\n\nCont-\nSo why would you use the microtransaction model? As others have touched on in the comments, part of the reason is that it makes more money, particularly by badgering players into spending small amounts a lot of times to make it harder to recognise the value of things. It's a deceptive price model and the majority of the reason I didn't recommend the game is because I see a brilliant game underneath a model that is unhealthy for the industry.\n\nThere's a perfectly reasonable arguement that places the responsibility entirely in the hands of the person spending, and I believe the majority of people who thumbs up or downed me are probably divided specifically on how they view that. Is it the responsibility of the designer or the player? I'd argue it was both and I'm not one to complain incessently about games, but this kind of price model is notorious for going after what you call \"whales\", and I just think it's in bad taste. \n\nIt's not where I want to see PC gaming go, and in my opinion it's dishonest game design and irresponsible because the majority of income from this game will come from players on both extremes, the ones with oil baron parents and addictive personalities or \"low hanging fruit\". I work in mental health and these kinds of games can end up pretty much robbing vulnerable people, where the model is most effective. You could quite literally lop the microtransactions off this beautiful game, readjust the timers to compensate, and have an honest title at a set price.", "timestamp_created": 1491011955, "timestamp_updated": 1491212254, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 803, "votes_funny": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835475802421569824", "comment_count": 79, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42640977": {"recommendationid": "42640977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038397264", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1531265401}, "language": "english", "review": "If this gets 1000 upvotes I'll livestream opening 1000 lootboxes.\n\nPlease don't I don't want carpal tunnel\n\nFinal edit, going  to leave the other ones below, scroll down if you wanna see the suffering I had during the stream.\n\nAlright, after 1000 lootboxes, I can say that I love this game. 10/10 bethesda, I'll do the same in TES Blades if you give me beta access HINT HINT\n\nShoutout to Commanderroot for staying there the entire stream.\nSlocool and Electricallongboard for being there for the better part of it.\n\nThe three above sat and didn't say anything during the stream and made me feel lonely.\n\nIt sums up to:\n\nStorage and stats:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Wv9yS8g\n\n238 dwellers  https://imgur.com/a/q6DlFnH\n2699/7360 storage \n203 stimpacks, \n179 radaways\n314800 caps\n429 nuka bottles\n8150 food\n9200 water\n8294 energy\n3 fires\n0 raids\n0% happinness\na shitload of rats\n4 hours 40 minutes\n\n\n--------------------------\n\nEdit: 9th of July 2018 the community has spoken, will update shortly, probably going  to do the livestream later on tonight.

Even though you can play the game without any extra MT's you are lured into buying stuff and constantly reminded that it is an option. \n \nThe game itself is really fun and actually pretty tactical if you want to max out a vault with 100 dwellers. You need to think ahead and plan the layout of the vault wisely or you will shooting yourself in the foot later on in the game. There is lots of stuff to do in the game and you are constantly busy with keeping your vault running in proper order. You can also send your dwellers on quests that will take place on different maps where you can get loot and key items and of course you can send them into the wasteland and let them explore. \n \nThe concept of the game is brilliant so in a way it is a bit of a shame that the game has been designed around MT's. I would love to see a full single player game of Fallout Shelter without the MT's and the slow progress, but for now I will just enjoy the game as it is.

I was very attached to the successful haven I had made.\n\nBUT\n\nThis game is excellent, especially when you have downtime. If you check on it and make minor adjustments once a day, your vault will be self-sustaining and easy to manage going forward. Missions outside of the vault are a great way to get more unique items, and sending dwellers that have been hard at work maxing-out their SPECIAL skills both levels them exceptionally well, while simultaneously pulling in large amounts of junk items, weapons and armor; which, if you have in abundance, can be sold for extra caps. I spent the last two quarters of my time playing with a constant 999,999 caps, dwellers in pristine condition, incoming threats usually never made it past three rooms at the most, and my ability to manage my resources patiently more than paid off. A lot of patience, proper reservation, and a lot of trial and error can turn this game from a major sensory overload into a casual tycoon-esque experience that demands little.

But some  people call it a cash grab but not really, I've been playing it for over a year now and haven't spent a penny. Sure the game has starter kits and loot boxes but those usually ruin the game and lootboxes can be easily obtained especially early on and late game. \n\nThe base game is very slow progressing but rewarding. I had a vault on the pc version and the android version. I got several dwellers from a few lootboxes I got doing quests on the android version and before I knew it all heck broke loose. The vault constantly got attacked and ran out of power however it had sixteen people and food or power. The 2nd vault on pc had barely anyone at first but was really wealthy  food, water, and power was plentiful. Both vaults were created day 1 and roughly around the same time. This is just how random chance and time consuming fallout shelter is. \n\nI recommend playing this game along with something else or inbetween breaks, this game is kind of like farm vill or insertfbgamehere but without the begging. The game does get kind of boring late game. I actually had a max size vault containning all fully S.P.E.C.I.A.l dwellers. It got boring real fast, deathclaws were like kittens to this vault they'd usually get to the diner on the 2nd floor and just die without causing any real damage. This is with no money spent mind you just casually playing the game atleast once per day for a few minutes.\n\nThe questing is a lot of fun and a good way to get items fast more geared towards f2p players or late game players who want to get some cosmetics or completionists who want every item in the game for some reason. The quests have little to no story so not for story fans. However they usually have refrences to previous fallout titles. \n\nWell that is the review I recommend you try it for yourself!\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1534012123, "timestamp_updated": 1534012123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.71760106086730957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31669515": {"recommendationid": "31669515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061172583", "num_games_owned": 354, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 7747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494442863}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a save game breaking bug, you\u00b4ll loose all your progress.

So yeah, I liked that.\n\nWhat I don't like is the interface; I try to move the camera, it moves a guy to a lower floor by accident, or I would try to put a guy to take care of Radroaches, it doesn't do anything.  This is where it gets more grueling than fun, as it happens constantly.\n\nThere's also a few nitpicks; a screen where you can see whatever stuff the Dwellers are wearing would've gone a long way, it'd be nice if gaining more resources than you can hold gives you money in return (it kind of does, but at random), and while I did say the grinding is good, because of it you also can't play the game when you're \"in the mood\", you need to wait for hours for stuff to happen.\n\nBut, the one thing that made me decide this game is not worth a damn is this; there's no cooldown on the Radscorpions.

I got three of these buggers in a row, I can't ever recover from those.\n\nAnother thing that happened is that, when I sent out a dweller in the wasteland, I gave him RadAways, but he never used them, so he died once because of radiation sickness and I had to pay 1000 Caps because the game is stupid.\n\nOnly for those who have a lot of free time and can overlook these issues, but as for me, NO.", "timestamp_created": 1529800879, "timestamp_updated": 1530569201, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.73452836275100708", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33868989": {"recommendationid": "33868989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024213758", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 3854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505640447}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun little free game.

It's enjoyable in certain aspects. I like managing my vault dwellers. I even enjoy the fact that I have seen myself grow slowly more evil the more dwellers I get, caring less about them individually and caring more about the bottom line. Is there enough power? Is there enough food and water? Are my dwellers meeting their mandatory happiness quotient of 75% or more? In that sense, the game is very fun.\n\nHere are my issues with it, and why I can't recommend it in good conscience.\n\n1) Kids suck. I completely understood my kid dwellers having garbage stats when ALL my dwellers were garbage. However, when I pair Lucas Simms and Star Paladin Cross together, goddammit I expect their child to have some decent stats. If they're NOT going to give me the ability to breed a stronger vault population, then I need to be able to stick those little good-for-nothings in one of my many training facilities so that by the time they grow up, they have a BIT of a stat boost. There's more, but I'll move on.\n\n2) If you're going to throw deathclaws and radscorpions at me when I hit 60 dwellers, I need to have the capability to provide my dwellers with better weapons. Frankly, it pisses me off that the ONLY good weapons I've gotten in this game are lucky drops from lunchboxes. Weapons cost too much to make, and the upgraded weapons crafting station is too expensive. I've dropped REAL money on this game. More than a game like this should be worth, and I STILL can't afford it, since my vault dwellers are constantly being ripped apart. Four dwellers with sawed-off shotguns SHOULD be enough to kill 5 molerats, or one radscorpion.\n\n3) Speaking of disasters, when a fire breaks out, or a radroach infestation occurs, or when molerats attack, or when deathclaws break through my front line, all the vault dwellers on that FLOOR should be responding, not just the ones in the room. I gave my door guards a gatling laser and a fat man, and they need to damn well use them to their maximum effectiveness, not just sit idly by while any number of menaces wreak havoc on the rest of my vault dwellers who only have sawed-off shotguns and hunting rifles.\n\n4) I regularly have full stocks of stimpaks and radaway. FREAKING USE THEM VAULT DWELLERS. EXHIBIT SOME AUTONOMY. \n\nI can feel the tendrils of microtransaction greed gripping every aspect of this game. I don't really mind microtransactions. Obviously if I did I wouldn't have spent a dime on this game. What I do mind, is microtransactions that don't REALLY give you anything. This game is designed to feed off of you like a vampire, constantly biting at your neck to get you to buy MORE lunchboxes, MORE quantum, MORE Mr. Handy's to collect your resources.

Although, on the PC it's another story. Don't get me wrong, this game is fun but only if you got time to waste. This is literally a waiting game. As a beginner, you will eventually wait for a room to be done producing whatever you need in the next 5 to 20 minutes depending on your Dwellers' statistics. You can always rush a room to produce anything much faster but there's always a risk. Same goes for quests. Once you unlock the Overseer's desk, going on a trip can take times. I imported my save data from my iPhone to my PC using iExplorer application so I already have tons of Nuka Cola, maximum amount of money and a Vault full of level 50 and maxed out statistics everywhere and loaded with Dragon's Maws, Plasma Rifles, Fatman and so on so doing quests wasn't challenging. The problem seems to be the trip though. It must depends on the level and the difficulty of the quest, but a trip can take up to 5 hours before your Dwellers arrive to their destination where you can finally begin your quest unless you use some Nuka Cola to skip the trip. The whole game is basically based on waiting or skipping tasks using Nuka Cola so it can be very boring as a start. Once your Vault is pretty much full of rooms and Dwellers, you definitly won't have to worry about waiting because that won't be the case. There's always going to be a room somewhere, ready for you to collect resources or caps. I don't know if that's the same thing on PC but on mobile, if I was not playing the game for a few hours and I came back to it later, my Vault was always lacking of something. either power or food or water. That was until I aquire a few robots to collect resources automatically. They manage the Vault while I'm not around but without a robot I remember how difficult it could be if I wasn't playing the game for a long time. The difficulty of the game will vary on the amount of Dwellers inside your Vault. If I remember correctly, once your Vault has 25 Dwellers, Molerats will start attacking your Vault from time to time. Otherwise you only have to deal with Raiders. Then I believe with 60 Dwellers, Deathclaws will start attacking the Vault, as for the annoying Radscorpions, I don't really know since I stopped playing after they released an update for them so I couldn't really analyze their arrival since my Vault already had 200 Dwellers. Rare/Legendary loots used to be easy. All I had to do was bring 20 Dwellers outside the Vault and after a few hours, they came back with rare scraps to craft rare weapons and armors/clothings. Now it seems to be just from quests because I don't remember collecting any rare loots from them in a long time.Quests aren't that easy. You always need a lot of Stimpacks and Radaway to deal with whatever is out there. So I got to say it's not the best way to make caps. Just send your Dwellers out in the wasteland and ignore whatever location they can find, let them travel around for more loots. Money is pretty easy, as long as you send a high level Dweller long enough in the wasteland and give them a good weapon with an outfit that gives enough Luck, your Dweller will definitly return with enough stuff for you to sell and make money. But of course you have to make a sacrifice at first. If a Dweller is low level, they will probably die outside. If they do, revive them. It cost caps but at least they're going to get stronger and stronger, and whatever they find out there should eventually bring back the money you lost. My advice is to raise your Dwellers as high as possible from the very beginning. It doesn't help at all with how many Dwellers are in the Vault, it's quite the opposite. More Dwellers always means more risk of getting your entire Vault wiped out by Molerats, Radscorpions or Deathclaws. If your Dwellers are not strong enough, it's pointless. Even if someone is carrying a Fatman or a Dragon's Maw. If your entire Vault is wiped out, it's going to be expensive to revive your Dwellers. If a Dweller dies and you don't have enough caps to revive the fallen one, just click or tap anywhere outside the window and wait until you got enough money. Although whoever is inside that room with a dead body will bring down their happiness and effectiveness. Quotes between Dwellers are pretty entertaining to read. The higher their Intelligence and Charisma, the \"smarter\" their quotes will be. Like two Dwellers flirting with each others. If two Dwellers are totally dumb, they're gonna throw some really weird stuff. lol Stats do affect a few things. Perception for instance will increase the productivity inside the water purification room. Even if the Perception is up to 10 on a Dweller, you can use an equipment to give +5 or +7 Perception and it will actually improve the productivity even more, reducing the production time as well. Same with Luck, the higher the Luck, the greater the chance to rush a room without causing any incident. The higher, the better. It might even give you a 0% failure if everyone has enough Luck and other stat for the particular room. Well, that's pretty much it. The game is fun but only if you're playing on a phone or tablet and you got nothing to do at all. Unless you're the type of person who sit at their computer without knowing what to do with their day, then that's a great way to spend the time.", "timestamp_created": 1491124606, "timestamp_updated": 1491364076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.683888077735900879", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "41744521": {"recommendationid": "41744521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088516352", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1524957886}, "language": "english", "review": "Note that the forums are crawling with warnings about this game deleting your saves.

In it, you take the role of an Overseer and are in charge of building your own Vault, keeping its inhabitants happy, making them reproduce, and so on. You can also send them on missions to gather items, which you later use to craft stronger weapons and equipment. Overall, I'd say there's not a lot to say about this game; it's a mobile port, so you shouldn't go in expecting a more \"traditional\" Fallout experience, but rather a casual game with a Fallout theme.\n\nThe gameplay, like I mentioned, is like a management sim. You start out with an empty Vault, and you must start building rooms to accomodate incoming Vault Dwellers. There's also three resources you've to take into account: energy, water and food, each with their respective room. As more people arrive into your Vault, you unlock new rooms, including the Overseer office, from where you can send your dwellers into missions. You also have to train your dwellers, as your Vault will sometimes be attacked by bandits, or other Wasteland creatures, even Deathclaws, who can easily destroy an unprepared Vault.\n\nPersonally, I found this to be a pretty entertaining game, although by the late game, when you've maxed out several of your dwellers and finished all missions, it gets pretty boring.

The dining room and water treatment facility will generate food and water to keep your people alive, while the power plant will generate electricity to keep all your rooms operational. You can increase your population by using a radio room to attract new settlers from the wasteland, and you can place male and female dwellers into living quarters so that they\u2019ll have children who will grow into adults. Other rooms will let you craft stimpacks, radaway, weapons and outfits (which boost the wearer\u2019s SPECIAL stats).\n\nEach room is linked to a SPECIAL stat (for example, the power plant requires strength) so ideally you need to assign people to work in rooms that make use of their best attributes. There are separate rooms dedicated to improving each of a dweller\u2019s SPECIAL stats.\n\nYou can also build an Overseer\u2019s office, which will allow you to send teams of 3 people on quests. Unfortunately this is where the game becomes extremely flawed.\n\nThe story on these quests is almost non-existent. Its mostly a case of \u201cwe need to find a thing\u201d, \u201coh look here is the thing\u201d or \u201cwe need to find a person\u201d, \u201csorry you just missed them, try looking in this other location\u201d. Fallout games usually have varied dialogue choices and multiple ways to solve quests. Fallout Shelter even has an achievement for making 25 dialogue choices during quests, but this is misleading. Most quests don't actually have any choices, and you can't control what your people say. My achievements page shows that I've completed 33 quests and only made 17 dialogue choices. This means that literally half the quests have 0 choices, and the other half have a total of 1 choice each.\n\nThe combat is also terrible. During quests you\u2019ll fight the usual Fallout enemies \u2013 raiders, feral ghouls, mole rats, radroaches, radscorpions, deathclaws. (These creatures will also periodically attack your vault, which is a complete waste of time \u2013 3 enemies making a suicidal run against my 100+ vault population is not even a challenge). Your people attack on a cooldown timer, so they'll fire 3 times and then wait about 10 seconds before firing 3 more times, repeat. Enemies seem to attack quicker, so you just sit there thinking \"you're taking damage idiot, fire back\" while your people just stand there doing nothing.\n\nThe most infuriating part is that sometimes your people will randomly decide to move to a different position instead of attacking. But this serves no purpose. They aren\u2019t moving to get into attack range. I've seen guys equipped with a sniper rifle move into melee range, and guys with a melee weapon or shotgun run to the other end of the room. Its just stupid. After making sure your people are equipped with weapons that have the highest damage values, the player will mostly just watch the combat play out, and occasionally click icons to do critical hits, and use stimpacks or radaway to heal your guys when they're on low health. If they die you can pay caps to resurrect them after the quest ends.\n\nThere\u2019s also lots of waiting. Its a free to play game with microtransactions that was originally on mobile devices, so obviously the whole game is set up to try to make you spend money to skip the waiting. When you send people on quests, it can take anywhere from 2 to 15 real world hours for them to arrive there (and the same time to travel back to the vault after completing or failing the quest). You can also only have a maximum of 3 active quest teams, with a fully upgraded Overseer\u2019s office. That\u2019s 9 people on quests, even if you\u2019ve got 100 guys in your vault. You have to wait hours for babies to be born, and more hours for them to grow into adults so you can assign them to work rooms. You have to wait hours to train SPECIAL stats. You have to wait hours to craft stuff. Its pretty much a case of play for 20 minutes, get to the point where you can\u2019t do anything else, close the game and come back a few hours later. But of course, you can use nuka cola quantum to skip the waiting and do stuff instantly, which you can either buy with real money, or occasionally find for free on quests.\n\nNow, maybe you can say these criticisms don\u2019t count, because the game is FREE. But when deciding whether or not to play a game, you don\u2019t just think about the money. You think about the time investment as well. I\u2019ve put 18 hours into Fallout Shelter, and unfortunately I can\u2019t say that I ever really enjoyed it.", "timestamp_created": 1492643604, "timestamp_updated": 1492798168, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 167, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685882687568664551", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43517730": {"recommendationid": "43517730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137885775", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1532693869}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun casual game to pick up from time to time.", "timestamp_created": 1531546003, "timestamp_updated": 1531546003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648348152637481689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34003970": {"recommendationid": "34003970", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971174762", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 6762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503724819}, "language": "english", "review": "Wait-to-play clicker that is deeply addictive and utterly pointless.

The gameplay is described as \"slow\" by many a negative reviewer, and this is unfortunately less than accurate.  There is a good bit of downtime, and that's intentional in a casual game, however, when incidents occur, the pace is quickened considerably as you scramble to organize your dwellers into something resembling preparedness.  \n\nThe true joy of a game like this is what you do with it.  It can be a casual experience, a somewhat immersive roleplaying experience, something you're dedicated to checking frequently or once a week.  You can design and develop your vault and the dwellers within as you see fit, though there are advantages to employing some strategy here.

Even the Steam version has ended up as less of a port and more of an emulation of the original iOS game. All of the needless clicking, microtransations, and timers that are ubiquitous in the mobile market - and so out of place on the PC - are still alive and well here.\n\nThe concept of the game itself is simple enough: build a Vault that produces enough food, water, and energy for its dwellers to survive and also protect them from random dangers. The means of producing those necessities and the dangers interrupting that pursuit have a few subtle variations, but exploring the wasteland and embarking on quests are the only things that actually break up the monotony. The dialogue during those quests and the journal entries a dweller makes while out in the wasteland are both surprisingly and darkly hilarious. Combining this clever writing with the excitement of collecting new items, the time spent outside of the Vault invigorates time spent inside it. However, that feeling can only last so long before the staleness of the majority of the experience overwhelms it. The same can be said about customizing dwellers or upgrading their equipment. More options, many of which are obviously worse than others, cannot make up for the fact that there's nothing more to do with them.\n\nFallout Shelter was made as a promotional tool and the attempt to grow past its beginnings by adding more content has not changed that fact. Modular pieces shoddily rearranged over and over again, sadly, do not make for exciting experiences. And yet, I've spent well over a hundred hours in this game, not counting the time I spent playing it on iOS. Something about Fallout Shelter certainly seems to appeal to me. I just wish I could figure out what it is.\n", "timestamp_created": 1507593867, "timestamp_updated": 1507593867, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.67144775390625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30989688": {"recommendationid": "30989688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049119398", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1541654429}, "language": "english", "review": "I used to play a lot this game back in the day in my cellphone but stop playing cause is really hard to keep track of eveything in the small window but now in with this PC version I can keep track of everything in my shelter would be nice if they let you merge the games you had in your cellphone or maybe add an iOS version so I can play in my laptop when im out of town", "timestamp_created": 1491531329, "timestamp_updated": 1491531329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642348766326904297", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47710862": {"recommendationid": "47710862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077233724", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 20195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547383427}, "language": "english", "review": "Lacks the depth an many possible aspects of an actual game (its a mobile game, after all), but a good way to kill time every here and then.

I never actually played it as such, but gave it a shot now just because I was curious, and the game has gotten a pretty good amount of positive reviews on Steam.\n\nTo keep it short, the game both scratched an itch and annoyed the hell out of me at the same time.\n\nUndoubtedly, the idea of managing a post-nuclear vault is an interesting prospect. The game has a nice style to it, and contains many familiar elements from the Fallout games. The big problem with the game, is that it's not a typical strategy/tycoon type of game that a seasoned gamer might wish for. Instead, it's a game about collecting resources by clicking, and waiting for real-time timers, just like certain mobile type games. It is a gameplay model I'm not very fond of at all, but I might even forgive it if you didn't have to wait a very long time for things to happen. The waiting times are too long - sometimes up to several hours, and I find myself just staring at the screen while occasionally clicking on things that doesn't feel anything close to rewarding. You can actually pay money to skip things, but I feel absolutely no desire to do so.\n\nThe game also is quite shallow. While I haven't yet unlocked all the possible rooms, I've gotten the gist of the basics. You assign dwellers to certain rooms, but they don't even appear to be doing anything useful. A looped animation is all you will see, and an occasional random comment if you are zoomed in enough. Sometimes, disasters occur, such as fires, infestations and raider attacks, but you don't really have to do a lot. The dwellers mostly automatically take matters into their own hands as well as they can, and that is usually enough. You might have to equip them and heal them now and then, and possibly order them around if rooms are unmanned. They stick to the room you picked, unless there's a disaster in progress. They have no life, but work in that room 24/7. You can order them to go to the residental area to make babies. They level up occasionally, but what that is good for I do not know. You can train them in certain rooms to improve their attributes.\n\nBuilding the vault is limited to a certain area, and a certain amount of room types which unlock as your shelter gets more dwellers. Rooms can be combined to form bigger rooms, and rooms can be upgraded a few times. Each room typically focus on one of the special attributes of the dwellers, giving what I assume are bonuses based on those. All you have to do is keep the rooms manned and connected. It is a rather bland experience.\n\nEventually, you will be able to send dwellers out on quests. Actually, you can send them out to explore earlier, but they just end up dead eventually, apparently not having enough brains to figure out when to return. You have to do that manually. You can track them by watching a log, which hints at a deeper simulation, but I fear it's a lie. Quests are a bit more interesting, since you get to order them around when they reach their destination. You tell them which rooms to enter and you can also pick enemy targets. However, in my experience, it's best to just stick to automatic combat. The combat itself feels like some kind of semi-turnbased kind of thing, but it's not very responsive and trying to affect it in any meaningful matter seems like a waste of energy. You'll also get to grab loot by clicking containers and dead bodies.\n\nI want to like this game, and I like the idea of a management game based on the Fallout setting. However, playing it is mostly a frustrating and unsatisfying experience. I just find it hard to recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1534257922, "timestamp_updated": 1535988571, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637368202209472656", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "41165190": {"recommendationid": "41165190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085007355", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 12894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546153186}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros: \n\n1.
