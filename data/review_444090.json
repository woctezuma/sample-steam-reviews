If they screw up, it's usually tweaked in the next patch, but it's made me step away from the game a few times (Fussillade Drogoz is a fun example that wasn't adressed for a couple of months)\n\u2022 Burst meta\n\u2022 Huge hitboxes\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNeutral:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Not Overwatch\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Basics:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn a team of 5, you fulfill one of 4 roles: a support (healer), frontline (tank), damage, or flank. A support primarily restores health to injured allies and debuffs or stuns opponents. Frontlines focus on pushing the enemy back and letting the team capture an objective. Damages dish out tons of, you guessed it, damage. And flanks are glass cannons, usually with high-mobility that lurk behind enemy lines to disturb the peace or take out high-value targets (like supports). While you can choose to play differently, a composition that is comprised of champions from each role works best. Just don't last-pick Victor.\n\nItems are important, too. There are blue items to help with defense, yellow utility items, green healing items, and red offensive items. You start with 400 credits and open the store with \"i\" at spawn or during the death screen. You can get more credits by healing, standing on an objective, killing an enemy, shielding, etc.. These are situational, and 1 item stacks for up to 3 purchases\n\nThere are 3 game modes: seige, onslaught, and team deathmatch.\n\nSeige is the most popular option. Both your team and the enemies will be fighting over a central point on the map. You capture the point by having 1+ people standing on it, while no enemies are also occupying the space. When the progress bar at the top of your screen reaches 100%, your team successfully gains 1 point and must begin pushing the payload that spawns immediately afterwards. Similarly to the first step, 1+ people need to be near it, and it will move forward if no enemy is also in its proximity. If you or a teammate manage to push it into the second point near their spawn, you gain another point. If you cannot before the time runs out, keeping an ally on the payload will push you into overtime where you can continue moving the cart forward. Leaving the payload at that time will result in the enemy gaining a point for defense.\n\nFor seige, the rate of capture depends on how many points each team has. There is a comeback mechanic that makes it so a team with 1 point will capture it faster than a team with 3 points. As stated before, you can get a point for defending a push from the enemies, but you can only get the 4th point by capturing the objective or pushing the payload. First to 4 wins!\n\nOnslaught is a game based around the first part of seige, so no pushing required. Your team captures a larger objective in a smaller map. You gain points by having teammates stand on it or kill enemy champions. If you die or let the enemy stand alone on the point, they gain points as well, but you don't lose any that you have gained. An enemy stepping on the objective will stop you from gaining capture points, but you can always kill them! The first team to reach 400 points, or whichever has the most points after 10 minutes, wins!\n\nTeam deathmatch is pretty simple. No objective, just enemies. You and your allies must secure 40 kills before the other team. Good luck!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy Experience\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm a support main that goes damage from time-to-time. I play with a damage/flank main and a tank/flank main usually. I have the most fun in a team where we can casually communicate and joke around. Aside from an occasional flame, most randoms are respectful, or at least quiet aside from a gg (or VHS) unless provoked. It's not very hard to get a good team composition, but people seem to play tanks the least. Some of my most memorable games didn't involve the traditional comp though. All support or all flank games can be fun in the dumbest ways. They usually don't end very successfully, but you can put up a pretty long fight. Some champions can even swap their designated role-- so long as you call it ahead of time in the character selection screen.\n\nI am afraid of the TTK slowly getting shorter and shorter and Hi-Rez catering to low-skill players more and more. I'm okay with newer champions that are easy to pick up, but they shouldn't be lower-risk, higher-reward than a mastered champion that's older. Currently the devs are conducting \"The Hunt\" for bugs, but there are plenty in the game that have been reported for years and not fixed. Usually when one is solved, ten more pop up anyway. They aren't usually game-breaking, but there are a handfull... I wish hotfixes were a bit more frequent, too.\n\nI'm not a huge competitive player, but the flank/damage main was. Kibycat reached master rank and was the #1 global Maeve for season 1. Being calm and admitting to your own mistakes is huge in climing the ELO latter. Partying up with another player helps a lot (there is a barrier if your ranks are too far apart). Good team composition matters. Positioning and gamescene matter even more. People take the game a lot more seriously in competitive games, so definitely take the time to communicate with your team about your decisions. Don't be afraid to tell them where your strengths and weaknesses are. That being said, you should gain some knowledge about all of the champions and be comfortable enough with at least two roles. You can play comp for fun, too, so don't stress much if it's your first time around! But know that it is definitely a different vibe than casual.\n\nAnyways, all-in-all, I obviously have a ton of fun with this game! There are some technical and balance aspects that worry me, but Hi-Rez is aware of them and responsive enough to keep a loyal playerbase. I've made so many friends through Paladins and am forever grateful for that. It has its highs and lows, but it holds a steady place in my lists of all-time favorite games.", "timestamp_created": 1549441722, "timestamp_updated": 1549441837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.764778316020965576", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48820044": {"recommendationid": "48820044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250281606", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550581455}, "language": "english", "review": "A lot of people who happen to be mostly Overwatch fans have been talking trash about this game. And having played Overwatch myself for approximately 2 years now and also having not tried Paladins until now mainly because of the critics about the games from my Overwatch friends. I was positively surprised by how good this game is, it does not solely cater to pros, probably because unlike Overwatch it knows that pros is about 1-3% of the player base and that most people want to play the game casually. But it does not mean that you don't need any skill to win, it does require skill to play some characters more than the others, and the better you are at aimming and timing, the easier it will feel to you. Starting this game, I thought I was gonna get rekt, and to my surprise I was not annihilated by the players like when I started playing Overwatch. I still get rekt in Overwatch in random games not even in comp, in random games. That's how bad the matchmaking and the design of Overwatch is. I regret investing in Overwatch and for not trying this game sooner. Overall, it's an amazing game, does not restrict itself with lore like most Blizzard games do, it allows things such as magic and modern weapons to be in the game.

Most of the community is toxic, not all, there are a handful of great peeps and when you get lucky enough to get a team of them you can have some of the most entertaining fun matches. Sadly those matches are far and few between and have a better rate while playing Overwatch. \n\nAs you play its not so much rage inducing as much as disappointing and disheartening. You aren't given the option to leave matches either even with someone throwing the game, lag, etc. because then you'll be tagged with a 30 min ban for leaving and longer if you do it again. The game will DC you even with good connection and/or low quality from time to time and  sometimes even give you a deserter tag for \"the game\" kicking you. While tagged you can't really do anything in the game besides look at the shop or you load outs. \n\nThis is a good game all things considered but unless you are playing with friends, the random people the game puts you will will make it less than enjoyable most of the time. If you just want to kill people and mess around and don't care about winning or losing and just wanna kill time then for sure play this game. That has become the only way I'll play the game without friends usually now.\n\n The game also has had a lot of drastic changes in the past like a huge health and dmg changes and how the rewards and money and such work, so keep that in mind before investing cash into the game. \n\nThe good things about the game is that it's good for what it is, it's a decent game, and it is free to play save for cosmetics. Though overall I'd say save your time and play TF2, Overwatch or some other game that's more consistent and has a better crowd playing.", "timestamp_created": 1550591050, "timestamp_updated":

While there's a lot of nuance to the mechanics and conditions of play, the fundamentals are this - capturing an objective zone to spawn a payload earns your team one point; escorting the payload to the enemy base earns you another point; but if the opposing team manages to successfully prevent the payload from reaching their base within a set time, then they earn the point. First to four points wins the match.\n\nCharacters, or \"champions\", technically fall into one of four different roles - front line; \"tanks\" made to take punishment and hold the objective - damage; made to dish out said punishment - support; primarily focused on healing - and flank; who are all about being sneaky-sneaky and harassing the enemy from behind. I say \"technically\", because, even though that's how they're labelled in-game, most champions can bleed into a couple of roles to varying degrees.\n\nOne important thing to note is you can't change champions once the match has started. So if you're part of a terrible group of players who wouldn't know how to create a decent team composition to save their life, then you're kinda screwed and more or less have to endure a horribly unbalanced game where a team lacks any real cohesion and synergy. But to help with this to some degree are loadouts and items.\n\nEvery champion has a deck of sixteen cards that are unique to them, and during your time outside of matches, you can construct your own loadout based on five of these cards which boosts the effectiveness of their abilities. Items are like temporary versions of cards that can be acquired mid game but are only applied for the duration of the match and bought with credits earned during play. And finally, there are Legendary cards, with each champion having three of these but needing to commit to one for the whole match. These are cards which apply a massive bonus to one of your abilities and can make your champ highly specialised in one aspect of performance or another. But this is where you have to be really careful, as choosing the wrong cards or items could make or break how a match goes.\n\nThis is actually one of the most ingenious features of the game, I think, as it allows for a lot of strategy and means the player with the best aim or reflexes won't necessarily be the victor. In fact, one of the things I love so much about the game is how accessible it is to so many different skill levels and styles of play. If you just want to do the shooty pew-pew thing, there's plenty of characters that'll have you covered there. Maybe your aim isn't so good but you have a keen sense of timing and situational awareness, in which case healer might be the role for you. Or maybe you just like being a stonkin' great big tank throwing your weight around at the centre of it all. There's a little something for just about everyone.\n\nBut the real star of the show here is the ever increasing cast of colourful, creative characters that somehow manage to all play massively differently from one another. Both the design and artwork really shines through, and is topped off with great animation and largely top-notch voice acting. There's an abundance of detail in every aspect of them, whether it's some little nicks and scuffs on the side of a firearm, or even the motions as they actually fire and are reloaded, or just the way a character moves around and performs each of their abilities, or even how they idle. There's a real sense of love and attention that's very clear to see, and that extends to every aspect of the presentation both throughout the UI and within each of the many maps as well. And, if anything, this only seems to be getting better as more and more interesting and creative content is being released with admirable and impressive regularity.\n\nAs well as all the artwork (I don't think enough credit goes to the card art in particular, while I'm at it) I think special mention has to go to the audio as well. Sound is very important in this game as every single champion has their own noises, from the sounds of their abilities being activated, to their main weapon being fired, to the stomps of their feet. If you listen out to what's going on around you then there's an awful lot of information to be found just by keeping your ears open. At any given moment you'll likely be able to tell exactly who's firing, roughly what direction they're in, and probably even how far away they are. A lot of players probably aren't even consciously aware of it, but it's always there and making a huge difference, more so than just about any other game I can immediately think of.\n\nIt's not all roses, though, as the game does have its fair share of problems. Personally, I think the damage feedback is desperately in need of improvement. Having the very outer edge of the screen momentarily turn a faint red hardly seems adequate in the heat of combat, and at this point I've lost track of the number of times I've died without even knowing I was being attacked in the first place. But a bigger issue than that is the matchmaking.\n\nI wouldn't go so far as to say it's broken, but I'm only a few more bad games away from calling it that. It feels like it's becoming increasingly hard to get games with consistantly matched players of equal skill, and 4-0 stomps are becoming more of a thing lately - which are never fun, no matter what side of them you're on. The rating system, on the other hand, I think at this point I can call broken. In Competitive mode, both your individual champions and your overall account ratings are awarded or docked points based on whether you win or lose, and then (presumably) used to calculate further matchmaking as it attempts to queue you up with players of equal skill. The trouble with this system is, it seems so focused on the bottom line win or lose result and has little bearing on personal preformance. As a result, you could play the best game of your life, but if you were teamed up with bad players, or someone on your team was disconnected or there were heavy lag issues, the game doesn't really care and will still deduct you for it. It's really not fun when you feel as though you're being punished regardless of your own ability or contribution, and as it stands right now, my own personal rating for both my account and many of my champions are in the toilet despite my consistant above average performances. And the worse thing is, that effect only seems to be confounded with time, as it takes multiple wins to make up the points for a single loss.\n\nAlso, due to recent changes, the grind for new players seems a little rough going. Cards need to be unlocked through a random loot chest system or bought with \"essense\" from duplicate cards, which could take a while and doesn't exactly encourage new player experimentation. Although, to its credit, it's nowhere near being pay-to-win, and I think Hi-Rez are generally pretty reasonable, and maybe even generous, with its current financial model.\n\nI mentioned the build version at the start because this is a game that's constantly changing. It's worth pointing out this was a very different game a year ago compared to what it is today, and some or all of what I've written could be completely irrelevent a year from now, for better or worse. But if it does change, I really hope it will be for good, and that I'll still be playing it and loving it just as much then as I do now.\n\nOh and you can ride horseys!", "timestamp_created": 1496928071, "timestamp_updated": 1496928071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1032, "votes_funny": 42, "weighted_vote_score": "0.9320639967918396", "comment_count": 21, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38182209": {"recommendationid": "38182209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095498431", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 17837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 112, "last_played": 1551477149}, "language": "english", "review": "UPDATE: As of 22-02-2018 Cards Unbound will be removed from the game thanks to HiRezChris (oh my god i'm so happy :D).

The grind comes from levelling them up, which requires duplicates found in loot boxes. Loot boxes can be earned for free but as you'll need around 43 duplicates to level a card to five, according to Paladins YouTuber Kami (via Kotaku), this will very much be the long the way. Buying loot boxes will be significantly quicker.\n\nLevel five card-abilities are significantly stronger than those at level one. Take damage dealer Cassie for an example (the Open Beta 64 patch notes detail each champion):\n\nHer Blast Shot reduces healing by 8/16/24/32/40 per cent\nHer Dodge Roll distance increases by 10/20/30/40/50 per cent\nHer Disengage cooldown is reduced 1.5/3/4.5/6/7.5 seconds when hitting someone in the air\nHer Tumble (Armor) grants 10/20/30/40/50 per cent crowd control reduction\nAnd her legendary, Just Breathe, increases crossbow damage 25/37.5/50/62.5/75 per cent over 100 units\n\nThe difference in strength between a level one-equipped player and a level five is obvious.", "timestamp_created": 1512222894, "timestamp_updated": 1512384131, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1191, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.901796281337738037", "comment_count": 51, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39193234": {"recommendationid": "39193234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027067686", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 127462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2316, "last_played": 1551826292}, "language": "english", "review": "I still have to give this a (weaker) Not Recommended. THE CARD SYSTEM DESCRIBED BELOW IS GONE, and the current system is better than ever, which is great. Gameplay currently lacks variety (all gamemodes boil down to 5v5 team deathmatch on similar maps), which made the gameplay get old quick for me, and unfortunately Hi-Rez is still doing some shady things (e.g., \"forgetting\" to mention in advance that they would change the price of voicepacks from being obtainable with the free currency, to exclusively bought with the premium currency). Daily quests are the main thing keeping me logging in. \n\nYour mileage may vary; if you can overlook these things, you might still find a game that you like.\n\n-----------\n\nOUTDATED:\n\nI am going to break down what happened in OB64. This is going to be long, but hopefully it helps you make an informed decision. First, I'll try to explain what the game was like prior to this patch:\n\nIn Paladins, you had three 5v5 PvP game modes: Onslaught (team deathmatch mixed with king of the hill), Payload (similiar to TF2, one team pushes a cart down a track and then switches sides after the round ends), and Siege (king of the hill, where the team winning the hill pushes a cart similar to Payload). There was also a ranked/competitive queue for Siege. Less popular, but still around are training versions of each game mode where you fight against bots, and custom games which work more like your traditional server browser matches. You would queue up for one or more modes, then select your character, and then select your loadout once you loaded into the map.\n\nEvery character in the game had 16 basic cards, of which you selected 5 to make a loadout. Each character had multiple abilities, and these cards modified how their abilities worked, or in some cases the stats of the character (health, movement speed, etc.). These cards had different effects, such as \"reduce cooldown on ability X\", or \"increase distance on ability Y\". When making a loadout, you could choose how powerful you want these cards to be, on a scale from 1 to 4. For example, at level 1 a card might increase the distance you travel when you use a dash ability by 10%, while a level 4 card might increase it by 40%. The cards in your loadout had to add up to 12 points; for example, you could have a loadout with card levels 4-4-2-1-1. Each character also had a premade loadout you could use if you weren't interested in setting up your own loadout. When you selected a loadout in match, you also selected one of three \"legendary cards\" separately, which were similar to the basic cards but had only one level and much bigger effects.\n\nSo, one issue with this previous system was how you obtained new cards for a character. You always started with 5 basic cards and 1 legendary card unlocked for a new character, enough to have a loadout ready to go; however, to obtain new cards, you had to open up a loot box that contained all of the cards in the game. You were unlikely to get the card you wanted unless you were pretty lucky, but any duplicates granted you a crafting currency (\"Essence\") that you could use to buy the cards directly. The lootboxes were a little pricey, but you did receive some from hitting certain XP milestones on your characters and general account, and you could buy them with the currency you earned just from playing the game (\"Gold\"). Depending on how many characters you played, it could be pretty hard to get all of the cards you wanted, especially the legendary cards which were a lot rarer in the lootboxes and much more expensive for direct purchase. (This was never really an issue for me given how much I played, but it was definitely a bigger issue for new players.)\n\nThis brings us to what the developers decided to do about this situation in OB64. They decided to get rid of the crafting currency, and give all cards to you for free. They also changed the old loadout system: instead of modifying the levels of 5 cards to create a 12 point loadout, you instead just select 5 cards that have a fixed level. Some are upset about this second change, since it reduces the number of combinations you can make.\n\nHowever, the change that has probably caused the greatest outcry is leveling up cards. Instead of having levels 1-4, they are now level 1-10 (now including the legendary cards). When you unlock a new character, your cards start at level 1 and are pretty weak. By level 10, the cards are much, much stronger. A card that increases the distance on a dash ability might given you +5% at level 1 and +50% at level 10. Another card might reduce the remaining cooldown of an ability when you kill a player; at level 1 it's a 10% reduction, while at level 10 it's a 100% reduction. These values are taken from real cards. A player with a loadout full of level 10 cards will have significant stat advantages over a player with a loadout of level 1 cards. (To play devil's advocate, the previous system probably wasn't totally fair to newer players either: the experienced player had more cards, and thus more flexibility in how they built their loadout. It wasn't a perfect system. However, in many cases I think the extra cards opened up sidegrades, rather than straight advantages over other players.)\n\nSo how do you level up these cards? By opening lootboxes. When you open up one of these lootboxes you still receive random cards, and after you collect a certain number of duplicates of a specific card it levels up. So many duplicates are required to max out a character at the moment, that even pretty hardcore veteran players (like myself) don't have enough currency to max out 1 of the currently 34 characters. At the moment these loot boxes can only be purchased with the in game currency Gold, or be obtained from your first few wins in a day. Still, even without a maxed out character, I don't feel comfortable having a straight stat advantage over newer players in a PvP game like this.\n\nThis system is arguably pay to win as well. One of the services the developer sells are boosters. Boosters increase the rate at which you earn XP and the currency you get from just playing the game. While you still have to play the game, those that pay for these services are going to be able to get more lootboxes, and therefore level up their cards quicker. They have also talked about putting a premium currency option for buying these lootboxes as well, a more direct pay to win (1/16/2018 EDIT: Earlier today, they quietly added an option for purchasing these lootboxes via a currency that can be purchased.)\n\nNow, all of the above said, Paladins might still be the game for you. If you are only interested in the Siege gamemode (the \"main\" gamemode), there are queues available where everyone's cards are set to the same level, both casual and competitive, a.k.a. \"Cards Bound\". Card leveling has no effect on these matches at all. You can just set up your loadout and be on an even playing field with everyone else. \n\nOn the other hand, if you're like me, and never enjoyed Siege but did like Payload and Onslaught, you're out of luck. Onslaught and Payload are exclusively available using leveled cards, a.k.a. \"Cards Unbound\" (technically Payload uses fixed level cards, but that is likely a bug). Also, the developers have stated that any future gamemodes (including the upcoming Team Deathmatch and Battlegrounds) will be exclusive to the leveled cards queue.\n\nI will probably continue to play Paladins for the time being, but I cannot recommend this game to others. This is mainly due to the above reasons, but also a few other problems (groups stomping solo queuers, Payload getting removed entirely in OB65, bugs I care about persisting for months, etc.).\n\nIf you read through all of that, I hope it was helpful. If these problems are addressed in the future, I plan to update this review.\n\nTL;DR: Just read it.", "timestamp_created": 1515450331, "timestamp_updated": 1523719425, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 752, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.902962625026702881", "comment_count": 40, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37998948": {"recommendationid": "37998948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097940016", "num_games_owned": 429, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 30845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1542383602}, "language": "english", "review": "EAs Battlefront 2 showed what not do in your game, turns out Hi-Rez couldn't figure it out and has gone the same way and will likely kill this game off with there stupidity.", "timestamp_created": 1512209153, "timestamp_updated": 1512209153, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 155, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.823662817478179932", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38003333": {"recommendationid": "38003333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020563551", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1544306313}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]UPDATE: Good news, it seems like they are removing the card changes from OB64 and replacing it with a more balanced system.

Hi-Rez has a history of killing games with greed. Paladins is not an exception.\n\nI stopped playing after 330 hours. I had a LOT of fun... for a while, with the game in the state it was in 20+ patches ago, but the trends were already clear: Simple fixes to polish the game were being ignored, champions were becoming more unbalanced, in-game currency grinding was becoming more of a chore (and was HARDER ON NEW PLAYERS ESPECIALLY - accessibility to new players [i.e. your friends] was one of the best things Paladins previously had going for it), the minimum requirements to experiment with gameplay in new and exciting ways were being pushed further out of reach, community feedback was being ignored, and unique core aspects of the game that made it what it was - that made it *fun* - were being eroded bit by bit.\n\n... and let's not even get into the bugs - actually, a bug with mouse input (which probably still hasn't been acknowledged) made the game unplayable for me, and that's why I really quit. By the way, mouse sensitivity options were *awful* last I played, where 0 was no movement, 1 was sluggish, and 2 was out of control for me. You don't get to enter a decimal, like in certain other games, like a thriving, polished hero shooter that gives me far fewer reasons to complain. The name starts with Overwat. anyway.\n\nI haven't opened the game for any reason since May, but I've paid attention to patch notes, and occasionally watched gameplay. It's clear that all of these trends have been spiraling out of control, and testing the patience of the community more and more. This last update should be the nail in its coffin: The previous, relatively balanced loadout system NO LONGER EXISTS - BOUND MODE IS NOT THE SAME. Unbound mode - which seems to be the new focus for development - NUMERICALLY PUTS NEW PLAYERS AND FREE-TO-PLAY PLAYERS AT A DISADVANTAGE AGAINST VETERANS AND BIG SPENDERS.

Price gouging of previously cheaper champions, skins, voice packs, etc.\n2. No longer dropping champion prices as time goes by \n3. Removing old currencies and not properly reimboursing players\n4. Restricting items that were previously obtainable through the in-game store to chests \n5. Restricting items previously obtainable with coins to a premium currency and/or chests \n6. Reducing the amount of gold players can obtain by cutting down on level-up rewards\n7. Removing the reward of getting premium currency for free by logging in 7 days consecutively \n8. Removing the option of buying skin pieces separately and bundling them into more expensive sets\n9. Removing certain skin pieces from sets and making them only purchasable on their own, thus increasing the total price of the set \n10. Adding a secondary premium currency which is obtainable through a subscription service ($5 per 2 weeks of subscription)\n\nThe changes Hi-Rez have made, have without a doubt hampered the enjoyment I, and many other players get out of the game. Despite all of that, in and of itself, Paladins is not a [b] bad [/b] game and there was a time when I would have called it good, a time when I would have called the monetization model [b] generous. [/b] \n\nThat time has passed however, and Paladins stands as an uninspired, shameless cash-grab that should not be worth a time investment, let alone a monetary one. \n\n[h1] 5/10 [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1516156496, "timestamp_updated": 1516157669, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 291, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.855153203010559082", "comment_count": 36, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39457688": {"recommendationid": "39457688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035188248", "num_games_owned": 764, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 13645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516366313}, "language": "english", "review": "How can anyone ruin a pretty solid hero-based shooter? The answer is simple: change one of your core mechanics in a way that makes it harder for new/casual players to compete. Let me explain: not long ago there was a card system, 12 points for powerups, a bit of customization for any hero. One can argue that some heroes had better bonuses than others, but it was still not that big of a deal, you can't go too OP with only 12 points. But right now you are not limited by said points, you can pick any 5 bonuses and boost them up with lootboxes or a lot of grind. So to be clear: max loadout you can get on a new hero is 20 points, 5 cards at lvl 4. If you buy a lot of lootboxes or grind 24/7 you can get it up to 50 points, 5 cards at lvl. So basically, with the same skill level a fight with a donator/grinder will always end in a loss just because where you have 20% bonus, he will get a 50% bonus. With that kind of attitude match making (that was already bad cause it often matched you with people with a vastly superior rank/skill) get even worse: not only it can get you into a game with people much better than you, but those people will most likely have better loadouts than you, pushing their level even higher compared with yours.\nSo while Hi-Rez got profit from that patch I have to ask myself: is it game even worth my time at this point?

This game is not perfect, don't expect it to be especially because it's still in \"BETA\". People Like to compare it to the big O, sure there are some similarities but this game is a completely different experience. It has more MOBA elements to it; loadouts, mounts and the credit system are what makes this game versatile and more complex. It has a great selection of \"Champions\" and i'm sure you'll find someone that'll match your playstyle. \nI will List down the pros on cons that makes me hate/love this game.\n\n\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[b]+Community[/b] - the community is smaller compared to its big brothers but this community is tight-knit and less toxic. You can see how the community support each other especially on twitch. The Paladins Twitch account periodically hosts smaller streamers but they host a lot of the bigger streamers a lot of times, they need to switch it up soon.\n\n[b]+Timely Update[/b] - currently, they are releasing updates once every 2 weeks. That is very impressive to me. They listen to the players and they make sure updates are pushed on time.\n\n[b]+It's Effing FREE![/b] - If that's not enough reason for you to give this one a try , i don't what would convince you. I mean you have nothing to lose! I honestly think this is the reason why this game is getting so much hate from the other community. It hurts their ego that people are actually enjoying a free-to-play game. \n\n[b]+Optimization[/b] - Paladins itself is a small file and can run on a potato! this makes it very stream-friendly and also wallet-friendly ;)\n\n[b]+Loot[/b] - you get free in-game stuff everytime you login and when you refer friends. You also get a chance to get free skins, weapons and crystals if you watch the Official Paladins Streams on Twitch. You dont have to spend a dime you can unlock a lot stuff. More stuff at their website.\n\n\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[b]-Servers & Downtime[/b] - As much as I love this game, HiRez Servers are probably the worst game servers i've personally encountered. The amount of down time in this game because of server issues is disgusting. Don't even get me started on the drop hacks. By the way SEA servers are still messed up, first game you get 90ping, next  game you get 400ping. It's been months and still not fixed\n\n[b]-Achievements [/b]- [strike] I wish they'd be more creative with their achievements. Add in some Challenging ones.[/strike] Well as of OB60 they added more achievements in the game. Kudos to the devs\n\n[b]-Matchmaking[/b] - matchmaking as of the moment is... crap. I have reached level 200+ and I sometimes get paired with/matched against people below level 20 and it's frustrating. People who are still new and clueless about the game. I'm sure they're working on improving this.\n\n[b]-Yo-yo Nerfing [/b] - Yes the updates are timely but hirez has a habit of \"fixing characters\" that are not broken. This patch he's nerfed, next update she's buffed. It can be a little discouraging sometimes.\n\n[b]-Grind [/b]- If you hate grind then this game may not be for you. It's not an easy grind especially if you dont have the Founder's Pack. You have to do a little grinding to unlock all cards and champions. This could be a little overwhelming for new players but playing with friends can help it make easier. You get extra XP and gold when u play with friends\n\n[b]-EAC [/b]- Easy Anti-cheat. where do i begin?... this software is a little controversial so im gonna leave it at that. Im sure other reviews have talked about this in depth\n\n\n\nFor a free-to-play beta game, Paladins has a lot of content and still has tons of potential. They are slowly adding lore and integrating nice story to some of the characters. New awesome skins and weapons that you can mix and match. If you really want to make the most out of this game, I say play with an open mind and stop comparing everything to other games, only then you will see its own beauty. \n\n\n[b][i]\"Comparison is the thief of joy\" -Theodore Roosevelt [/i][/b]", "timestamp_created": 1503621889, "timestamp_updated": 1507292651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 282, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.882048904895782471", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "48683296": {"recommendationid": "48683296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131425231", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 41858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 687, "last_played": 1551682718}, "language": "english", "review": "Game was fun back in Acension Peak, after that it went donwhill.\n\n- Bugs became more prevelant\n- Devs dont play the game\n- Devs shove off good/relevant critiscm as hate speach or yelling\n- Half the community enables poor development, and the other half yells for bug fixes\n- T E R M I N U S is a character\n- Game forces 50/50 winrate causing steamrolls on both sides\n- Overall drop in visual quality after Acension Peak\n- Skins have become more of a focus over bug fixes and balancing\n- Parts and pieces was better than the costumes we get now.\n- Tutorial needs a huge update explaining in game mechanics (comeback, cards, talents, payload healing)\n\nI used to love the game, but its lack of real attention from the team has caused a lot of us users to leave until it gets better.

Oh, and Talus is impossible to beat in the hands of a good player - his teleport and super are both extremely OP. \nAnd, incidentally, the player-base has worsened, with lots of afk, feeding, and general stupidity. Time to give Paladins a rest for a while.\n\n(Original review)\nThis review is for  OB52.\n\nPaladins asks the question: with a game this good being free to play, why bother spending $60 for a similar experience? Paladins [i]is[/i] still in beta, but if you\u2019re just looking to go and play a couple of matches every day, level and equip characters, and enjoy fun co-operative versus-style matches, it is a shining example of how good free-to-play (FTP) can be.\nTotal size on my hard drive: 6.3 GB.\n\n++  NOT pay-to-win. There are things you can purchase to level faster, but nothing is required.\n\n+ Great graphics. Drawn in a cartoon-y style like Torchlight or Kingdoms of Amalur, it uses the old DirectX 9 api, so it\u2019ll run well even on lower-end machines.\n+ A wide selection of characters, though only 5 to start with in the FTP version. Some very funny specials, too (like turning an enemy player into a chicken!).\n+ Customizeable passives via cards. There are a lot of options to choose from (though not at first), allowing for different rates of damage and effectiveness of special attacks.\n+ Maps are perfectly sized for 5v5. Not too large or too small.\n+ Quick match-making at the time of writing. Average wait time is between 0:30 and 2:00.\n+ Gold drops at a decent rate (bonuses and quests help).\n+ A team working together will almost ALWAYS defeat a team of solo artists. If you\u2019re hoping to be a hero and try soloing a group of enemies, you\u2019ll die. Fast.\n+ Occasional lag, but overall a very good online experience.\n+ I like a ton of maps because it keeps the game fresh. Paladins has about a dozen (some specific to certain modes), with more on the way.\n+ It\u2019s impossible for two people on the same team to play the same champion. Prevents excessive trait exploitation and forces teams to try to balance their squad.\n\n+/- Unlocking all the characters at the start of the game requires the purchase of the $20 \u201cFounders Pack.\u201d Some things HAVE to be hidden behind a pay-wall \u2013 nothing is ever truly free, and the company has to make some money somewhere. $20 is an extremely reasonable price considering the amount of content included. And if you decide to forego the Founders Pack, the good rate of the gold drop means you\u2019ll be able to afford a new hero or two quite quickly.\n+/- If 5v5 seems like a low number of players in a match, don\u2019t hope for more. The maps would feel crowded.\n+/- Not a fault of the game, but the usual multi-player nonsense is present in Paladins. By that I mean: solo-artists trying to be heroes without playing the objective(s), who then blame everyone else for losing the match.  \u201cGood\u201d matches far outnumber the bad, but don\u2019t be surprised if jerks show up (as they inevitably will) from time to time. The community in general is helpful.\n+/- No drop-in / drop-out. Matches only start with a full roster. Not an outright negative because it helps prevent cheating and makes the gameplay easier to balance, but those hoping to join matches that are in progress will be disappointed.\n\n- No weapon loadout customization. What you see is what you get. Again, easier to maintain, implement and balance, but those hoping for customized weapons won\u2019t get them.\n- While maps are generally sized well for the number of players, sometimes it feels like there are only two or three corridors that need to be controlled.\n- Paladins is still in beta, so there are still adjustments to be made. Some champions (like Maeve) are incredibly OP and in major need of nerfing.\n\nI\u2019m basically reaching to come up with outright negatives. If you enjoy a quick-paced, flowing multiplayer game with plenty of fun maps and unique characters, Paladins is worth a look. And it\u2019s free to play! Mind-boggling.

If you are not into pay2win games, don\u2019t play Paladins and don\u2019t support it with your money.\n\nUPD1: At the time of initially writing this review, the  pre-release version of OB64 was PTS 4. The next pre-release version, PTS 5, is currently being tested on a test server, and it has made things even worse, so I currently hold totally no belief that Hi Rez cares, and am not even sure if I stay in the Ranked mode, which is supposed to be unaffected by pay2win. \n_____________________\nMy review is going to be a bit longer than the others, sorry about that: I am this kind of person who writes walls of texts. \n\nAt first I was planning to write a long review that would deeply analyze how does Paladins compare to Overwatch, e.g. \"Overwatch has way better graphics and lore, but graphics and lore don't bother me, both games have crappy balance (you can find tons of articles about both games), Paladins have way more interesting gamemodes (compare the boring Payload in Overwatch to the Siege in Paladins), lower time to kill, better average mobility, etc\u201d. Actually, from my extremely subjective point of view,  Paladins wins against Overwatch as it is now. As it is before the OB64...\n\nOn December 13th a new update is gonna hit (and most likely kill) the game, with a system called \"Cards Unbound\", which is gonna turn Paladins, currently a free-to-play session-based FPS/MOBA game, into a pay2win MMORPG. \n\nHere you can read more about that system's cryticism: https://www.reddit.com/r/Paladins/comments/7glgis/why_cards_unbound_is_an_absolute_nono/\nDon't forget to read the comments, they have some extra points raised. \n\nHere you can sign a petition against it: https://www.change.org/p/hi-rez-do-not-introduce-the-cards-unbound-system \nThis is already signed by 6241 people as of 7. December 2017, which is around 1/3 of average amount of daily players for the last 30 days (according to Steam Charts: http://steamcharts.com/app/444090). After just 6 days in!\n\nI am lamenting, but not because I can't afford Overwatch -- I own it, but I just don't like the low TTK (time to kill), low mobility, poor optimization, and many more other to-be-improved aspects of the Blizzard game. Neither am I whining because I cannot afford to buy those powerful cards that are to be released and basically require you to pay or grind: I can afford them. But I just don\u2019t want to pay for them.\n\nPlaying a pay2win game is unfair in any case. If you win, you cannot be proud of it, because there is a chance that you have won just because you have paid. If you lost, you can always just think that it happened because your opponents have bought better cards. \n\nIf I am going to play Paladins after this update, unless the concept of \"Cards Unbound\" changes, it is going to be ranked matches: they will not have they pay2win aspect, cards' level will be a fixed number, equal for everyone. However, I am not even sure about me playing ranked after OB64 as it is currently announced, for the following reasons:\n\n1) People who don\u2019t play ranked games, perhaps at all, and only play non-ranked matches, can get fed up with the upcoming pay-to-win chaos, and transfer to ranked games with their non-ranked mentality: for example, not playing to win, but rather playing for fun and for the sake of it, not caring much about the rest of the team, about coordination, picking the right characters for the current situation instead of the one you like to play most, etc. This will spoil the fun for many ranked players, who expect a lot of team cooperation to win. Of course, those unranked-thought guys will unlikely fit in the high-tier divisions like Diamond (top 16% players), but they will likely spoil low-tier ranked divisions like mine (Silver IV, something very low). I am, perhaps, low-skilled, but I am very deeply involved in team coordination, and expect other ranked players to be that way.\n2) This is covered by the Reddit post, but some the balance of Paladins was largely based on the cards. If you drastically change them, you also harm many aspects of Paladins that make it a good game. Some cards that enhance movement abilities gonna get nerfed \u2014 means that mobility in general gets nerfed once again, and it is harder to escape when you think that it is time. DPS abilities\u2019 cards are buffed \u2014 time to kill becomes lower again, healing is indirectly nerfed, tanky abilities with limited tanking HP pool are indirectly nerfed, DPS heroes are buffed. Some new abilities get introduced during the chaos of OB64 \u2014 there will be no testing environment for it. Etc, etc. \n3) Also covered by the Reddit post, but the game will mostly lose its customization aspect, which I liked very much. \n\nOverall, it makes Paladins five steps closer to the pew-pew shooters like Battlefield or Quake. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they are awesome! But I liked Paladins for being different: after all, if I want some pew-pew gameplay, I can just play Serious Sam, Battlefield, or Quake. \n\nThis also makes Paladins 10 steps closer to a typical Asian MMO, with a typical grind2win and pay2win fests. While some gaming cultures consider pay2win something typical, any such mechanic alienates the game from the competitive genre.\n\nI am very sad about it, but Hi-Rez, the developer of Paladins, seems to miss the events currently happening to EA and their recent \u201chit\u201d, Star Wars: Battlefront II, that has lost billions of dollars for their lootboxes problem. \n\nAnother problem is that when the game has so many players, it is very hard to find friends to play with or get your players into this game. They will all learn about they Pay2Win hell that this place will become and likely decline the offer. After all, it will be a bit unfair to know about this and try to get someone to play Paladins. \n\nI would be glad if they cancel this update, but I don\u2019t believe in this. I will try to find my own place under the sun of this game. \nThough, I strongly not recommend this game to anyone who is not deeply involved yet.\n\nYes, I understand that the game developers themselves are *likely* not the ones to be blamed: the executives are.

Later that was changed to only 7th and then came essences, i didn't liked them but overall they didn't change my experience with the game that much. \n\nThen Hi-rez decided to divide skins and weapons into more ridiculous lootboxes but you could still earn Crystals so it wasn't as annoying even though Radiant Chests itself became quite useless for those who bought their Starter Pack. \n\nThen came the ridiculous VIP system... i mean that's basically 4th currency in-game... we already have gold which in itself is quite useless if you have all champions (i mean sure you can spend it on radiant chests but these days they only give essences and shitty looking pallete swap skins so if you don't need them then well... they're quite useless), essences that are only needed for crafting champion cards (we used to buy them with gold) and besides the premium Crystals, we now have VIP Points, sure you can earn them in-game by playing, but it is a painfully slow process and to get anything with them, you basically have to buy VIP Membership.\n\nDo you see where im getting with this rant?

As in all other f2p games, people won't be THAT discouraged to risk their account being suspended or banned, since they can just create a new one and hop back in.\nThis might be the reason why I encountered some bug-abusers and the like. (Not that OW is completely free of them)\n\nThen comes the gameplay differences, which i heard said in a youtube video, I sadly can't give you the source, it just randomly appeared on my yt feed, where the guy stated a few reasons why he switched over from OW to Paladins.\n\nSymmetric maps.\nHave you had a game on a 2 cp map like temple of anubis, while defending, only to realize that after one bad teamfight, the first capture point was more than likely already lost by the time you get back in there? It happens.\nHere in Paladins, both teams start off the same distance from the capture point, with mounts that speed up the process of getting back into the fight, big time.\nEdit: Please note, that in Overwatch, on two capture points maps, such as ToA that i mentioned or Volskaya for example, both teams play both sides of the map, the same goes for payload maps, with defending\\attacking teams taking turns.\n\nLocked heroes.\nA big piece of overwatch is counterpicking enemy heroes, or just picking so called \"stall heroes\" at the end of a game, to help push the game into overtime.\nThis doesn't happen in Paladins, since the hero you pick at the beginning of the game, is the hero you gotta play with, until the end of the game.\nI'm not sure if this is a good or a bad thing, let's just say the two games are apples and oranges in this regard.\nEdit: On the topic of heroes, I'll state that unlike in Overwatch, where all heroes are playable from the get-go, in Paladins, you have three tiers of hero prices, 15k gold, 30k gold, and 60k gold, with the average daily quest giving you 500 gold, but there are other sources of gold income as well, such as level up rewards, daily login rewards, and I'm sure I've skipped some other source of income here as well :)\n\nThen comes the fact of the customization of your hero, via use of loadout cards, so if say, you want to play a tankier damage champion, like Viktor, you can do that, or if you want to focus more on your damage output with a frontline champion, like Fernando you can do that as well.\n\nAnother layer of customizing your gameplay is the items, which can range from decreasing the healing received of enemies you hit, through a percentage of lifesteal to your attacks, to basic cdr stuff, to having decreased incoming damage from enemy basic attacks.\nYou can turn on auto-items, but the system does not have a guaranteed 100% usefulness as far as i have seen, it can occasionaly buy you items that have zero use in the given match, ie getting the cauterize item (lower healing received), when there's no healer on the enemy team.\n\nAnd to finally shut things down, the system requirements.\nNot only is Paladins free to play, it ran smoothly in uHD resolution on my not-that-great integrated AMD Radeon vidcard, while OW was unplayable with it, with everything set to the lowest settings and the resolution scale at around 60-70%, and despite these downgraded gfx settings, still experiencing major stuttering.\n(Thankfully since then i had an upgrade, now both games run smoothly)\n\nOn another note: sadly, it seems that older Paladins accounts have access to both the older starter hero line-up, AND the updated starter lineup, which can't be said for newly made accounts, which my brother experienced, since he was a late arrival to the game.\n\nSo that's it folks, my thoughts on Paladins, and a bit of comparison to the other big name in the genre, hope it helped, and i hope to see you in the Realm!", "timestamp_created": 1540551950, "timestamp_updated": 1543090922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.82652658224105835", "comment_count": 28, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38281316": {"recommendationid": "38281316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063585003", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 8452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520695700}, "language": "english", "review": "You would think a dev team that screwed 2 potentially good games up by monetisation (to a point at which a F2P game becomes P2W) in the past would learn from their mistakes.\nNope, here you go, you started digging a hole next to tribes' tombstone!\n\nI kinda regret buying the founder's pack now \n\n\ngood jop hirez...", "timestamp_created": 1513176905, "timestamp_updated": 1513177024, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.650188684463500977", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "42258391": {"recommendationid": "42258391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018790945", "num_games_owned": 495, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 27831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 248, "last_played": 1551792882}, "language": "english", "review": "+ It is free!

In every season I played, I managed to obtain the rank of Master. I love the pace and mechanics of the game, however I could not recommend it to anyone.\n[h1]The Developer's Approach[/h1]\nFrom the early beginning when Paladins was still in beta, it suffered from a lot of bugs. Hi-Rez studios didn't seem to have a need of fixing the bugs as the first priority. This way, the list of present bugs grew with every update. Some bugs have literally lasted in the game for YEARS and are still there! Let me talk about one as an example. Sha Lin is a damage class champion with a bow, that he uses every second of a match. Since the day I started playing the game (which was in the autumn of 2016), there has been a big problem with the champion - everybody has had huge FPS drops when drawing the bow. Now just imagine, there are dozens of bugs that have, just like this one, been in the game for years and haven't been fixed yet! In the present, Hi-Rez are still focusing on new content instead of bug fixes and with every patch the number of bugs is growing; there are even champions that cannot be played in e-sports because of how much they are bugged.\n[h1]The Beta[/h1]\nPaladins was in beta for years. Many times, the developers made drastic changes to the mechanics of the game; they even reverted some patches in OB67 (which was probably the best update in the history of Paladins)! Now don't get me wrong, the long beta was perhaps the best thing Hi-Rez ever came with. During the beta, Hi-Rez released a new champion every odd patch and a new map every even. This would be great, if they also put effort into fixing bugs. In may of 2018, they decided to release the game from beta with the patch 1.0, due to lack of finances. This was the worst thing that could have happened - the game was in a bad state, unpolished and full of bugs. Even now, almost a year after the patch 1.0, I don't think the game is in a state, in which it could be released. In my opinion, this move bought Paladins a one-way ticket to oblivion and extinction.\n[h1]The Matchmaking and Ranking System[/h1]\nThe ranking system is basically pointless - it records your personal rating in the team based game, while it doesn't take into account your personal performance! That means it doesn't matter how well you do; if you spend the whole game afk in a spawnroom, you will lose the same amount of points as a person, who unsuccesfully tried to carry your team and ended up with the best numbers in the game. Now you might think that's fine, but it  is really not. Wait times for ranked are awful. You have to wait usually about 10 minutes for the match (if you have a decent ELO), then you pick champions for another 3, then someone crashes, then you wait again and when you finally get to play, you get queued with smurfs and people who have much lower ELO than you, so the game lasts for about 7 minutes anyway and it's just not fun. So in the end, you spend way more time waiting for your games to find than actually playing. Also, let's mention the leaderboards. The list of grandmasters, who are supposed to be the top players in the game is just a joke. Everyone who has thousands of hours to play can get there. There is only a few people in GM that have a good W/L ratio, you can go check for yourself. So to sum up, the rewards and ranks are just an index of how much you play and how long you grind.\n[h1]The Bots and Reconnecting[/h1]\nA bot, character controled by AI, is a definition of evil in this game. In higher ELO matches, when a player crashes or leaves the game due to any other reason, it basically means a lost game - bots are very likely going to spin in the spawnroom or, if they decide to join the fight, just blindly rush and die. Now you technically play a 4v5 game. In other scenarios, the bots get inhuman skills and reflexes and thus you have a 6v5 game. Due to the bugs and bad servers, you are going to have at least one bot in 25% of your games. The bot is even allowed to buy items for you, which is a problem when you have a limit of 4 various items to purchase. Your teammates will probably become afk too, because, seriously, who wants to play a 4v5 game? The afk players will not receive a ban anyway, because Hi-Rez probably ignores all the reports. Of course, a disconnected player can reconnect and continue playing (althought there is a bug that makes you unable to rejoin the match). The problem is that after your game crashes, you have to wait until the anticheat opens (which takes an eternity), then fill out the the crash report or close it and after all that you can start Paladins again. But that's not all! If the game lets you connect back into the match, your bindings reset so you have to open and close the settings and the textures usually become broken too. When leaving the spawnroom after reconnecting, you teleport when passing the exit, which makes the play around the spawn impossible. What's more, your FPS might get crazy and the whole experience you might have gotten from the game is completely ruined. If you or your teammates decide to give up, there is no way to do so, because the option to surrender was taken out of the game for a reason.\n[h1]The Balance[/h1]\nEvery champion has 3 talents that a player can modify the playstyle with. This sounds interesting, but in the end this is just an illusion of choice. Most of the champions' third talent is just weaker than the others or completely useless. Many times, there is only one good talent for the champion and if you pick another, you are basically throwing. The reason for this is that some champions have a bad base kit. Let me take Ying as an example. Ying is a healer that can heal with illusions she places. She has a talent that makes her able to heal for a straight 800HP with a right click. Now with this talent she is considered one of the best healers in the game. And without the talent? You're throwing! Another problem is Hi-Rez itself - it takes insanely long for them to nerf the overpowered talents. For instance a card that gave you wallhack every 3 seconds was nerfed after more than a year!\n[h1]The Way Information Is Given to the Player[/h1]\nThe game doesn't tell you anything about itself. Only thing it teaches you (in tutorial) is how to walk and shoot, which you can read in the setting. It doesn't say a word about the mechanics of the game. it just doesn't tell you anything! If you are a new player, do you know what does a 'Comback mechanic' mean? I doubt it, even the e-sport casters have to explain it 10 times a day. The game does not even explain loadouts or an item shop!! Only way you learn about it is by noticing an UI prompt that says 'PRESS I TO PURCHASE ITEMS'. And there are more: The killstreaks and their relevance, the effect of silence, cripple and CC... You are not even able to figure it out by yourself at the Shooting range, because the bots there are immune! And I could continue for days. Some mechanics aren't explained at the Wiki either; you seriously have to go and ask a content creator in the chat of his stream or comments under his video!\n[h1]Other Game Modes[/h1]\nThere are also other game modes apart from Siege in Paladins. Let's talk about Team Deathmatch. The maps for this mode are often designed so badly, it's painful to play. A lot of them have very bad spawn points and one team has an advantage over the other. The spawn algorithm is so bad, it sometimes doesn't move your spawn point for the whole match (thus you have to travel a long way to the battle or you just might get easily spawn-camped). All this causes that 75% of the map can remain unused. Furthermore, Hi-Rez is still trying to force you to play it by creating stupid TDM missions and other kinds of content.\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nThere is much more but let me post a final verdict here. I give this game 2/10 and recommend everyone to stay away from it as far as you can.", "timestamp_created": 1548702131, "timestamp_updated": 1549205545, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 293, "votes_funny": 33, "weighted_vote_score": "0.84151923656463623", "comment_count": 52, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "46419341": {"recommendationid": "46419341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288163172", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 163055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2437, "last_played": 1551850849}, "language": "english", "review": "Now that I have reached level 999 on this game and also have more than 5k hours on it I decided to give a small take on it. (I'll probably keep on editing this review as this game constantly changes overtime, and YES I realize it says 2k hours on my steam but all my playtime is OUT of steam!)\n\nThis was the shooter that made me like the genre and I grew a lot of affinity for it, I thought the design was unique, the graphics were colorful, the grind kept me engaged, so on and so on. As a point based shooter this game is amazing, all the characters are completely unique and fun to play,the game always felt competitive for me which made me want to improve more and more over time I'm here since OB30 I saw this game growing I know almost all its flaws and pros. \n\nBut I will go into the point already: Should you try this game? If you are into shooters the answer is yes definitely\nI dont think paladins is easy to get into as a new player, not because of the shooting mechanics because these are by far one of the most easiest factors in the game, the hitboxes are very compensating (disgustingly so at times), but the main thing that you want to develop is rather a good game sense and understanding of all the items and loadout cards in this game. As a new player I ditched this as I looked at all of that, got overwhelmed and tried to not mess around with it too much. if I could go back now I would take more time on that since the beginning, see what cards are mostly used and what is more useful for every champion, also items in game are one of the most important parts about this game as it can determine a win or loss, your items matter for your whole team so learning how to buy items is a must for any new player, this is for sure something that would help you a lot on improving.\n\nNot everything is shiny on this game though, tons and tons of bugs are the main issue and def can make some players quit, these can be major or really minor bugs, and many times questionable balancing. If you are going to invest your time on this game you gotta know straight out of the bat that hirez is a very experimental company and they can try anything as stupid as it might sounds to see if it makes the game any better in any way, but also bare in mind that hirez also listens to the community a lot and can revert any bad move the game has possibly taken. \n\nRegardless you will have fun with this game, its constantly being updated and its easily one of the best free to play shooters on steam.", "timestamp_created": 1542912461, "timestamp_updated": 1544976001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 124, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835630536079406738", "comment_count": 24, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38096857": {"recommendationid": "38096857", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960415763", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511860219}, "language": "english", "review": "Dont.

Heck. \nWell, nevermind, this game has fallen so far from grace that it's almost hilarious, and I would be laughing if I weren't crying, mourning this game which I love. Loved. Still, I remember having more fun in Paladins than I do with Overwatch. Even if the matchmaking system was garbage and Hi-Rez consistently ignored my favorite champions (Barik, Ashe, Inara, Sha Lin, Tyra, Grohk, Lex) or some of my friends' champions (mainly Pip and Grover) in favor of either buffing already obnoxious or sometimes overpowered champions (Drogoz, Evie, Maeve) or nerfing already paltry champions (Grohk, Inara, Pip). Either that, or Hi-Rez completely ignored the gameplay aspects of an update, pushing out ten champion changes, max, all of them miniscule compared to the microtransactions that they decided to implement full-force and suddenly that update (See: Essence system, Cards Unbound). Paladins was a great game. I only wish that Hi-Rez would stop taking a page out of EA's playbook. Ignore this game. Go play literally anything else.

They've stubbornly gone ahead with a patch that a vast proportion of their playerbase was strongly against and obviously so. They pretty much turned a deaf ear and held the stance that they'd planned to implement this new card system so it's going to happen. Sure, they pushed back the update a bit and tweaked it some before pushing it out but it's still unwanted and it has still turned away a lot of people, myself included. I'm not saying I'll never play it again as I may give it a go from time to time, but I've lost a great deal of interest and found myself moving to other games, so we'll see.\n\nTo explain the bulk of the issue, in OB64 which launched today, they've changed the loadout card system. Previously, you spread 12 points across 5 loadout cards. Each of the 5 cards costs 1 of those 12 points and with the remaining points you decided how much more, if at all, you want to boost the usefulness of each card until you hit the required 12 points with a cap of 4 points per card. This allows for a good amount of customisation and the game was also pretty well balanced (if you don't count the most recent champion additions which seemed OP to me).\n\nNow they've made it so that you still have a 5 card loadout, but there's no points limitation. You can level them all up to level 10 which is the new points per card limit. However, you can't use a card at level 10 unless you own it at level 10. You level cards up by getting duplicates in RNG loot chests. You won't be able to max out a card without a lot of time and luck... Unless you feel like buying a bunch of chests for real money to save yourself some time. Obviously a player who has all level 10 cards will have an advantage over a player who has all level 5 cards for example. The level 10 player will also probably have been playing for longer and be more skillful than the level 5 player, which widens the disadvantage a new player has. This makes the game unbalanced.\n\nHaving said this, you can play gamemodes where everyone's cards are locked at level 4 (they're boosted/pushed back to 4 points each for the match regardless of what level they're usually at). This addresses the unbalancing issue but kills a good chunk of the customisation possible in the 12 point card system.\n\nYou may wonder why on earth they went ahead ahead with this. There only seems to be speculation over reasons why, which you'll probably find pretty easily if you're interested in the Steam discussions and on YouTube etc. I won't give any reasons here because it's speculation. I just think it's lousy that Hi-Rez Studios was so determined to go ahead with something that got more negative than positive feedback. They also handled it poorly by making little effort to address the concerns and seeming to mostly ignore the comments regarding this update. If people have concerns you should address these concerns. Leaving them to build will not help the situation. The only time concerns can't be addressed properly is when they're justified and if they're justified then there's a problem.\n\nFor these reasons, at this moment in time I would not recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1513681692, "timestamp_updated": 1513681692, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616147935390472412", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28262915": {"recommendationid": "28262915", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006838480", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 6606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481244741}, "language": "english", "review": "With Easy Anticheat being added I cannot support the title.\n\nIt's a kernel-based anticheat that is known to waste resources even when the game it's supposed to monitor exits, allows the developer to actively take screen-wide screenshots and upload them for them or anyone else to see, can cause system instability via blue screens, and it runs at a root level.\n\nIf you favour privacy and keeping others' out of your system, then skip this title lest you install one of the worst anticheats currently in ploy.\nRemember: If there's a bug that can be exploited against EAC, then you can have your entire system compromised by amateur anticheat makers.", "timestamp_created": 1481245665, "timestamp_updated": 1481245665, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 953, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.834948182106018066", "comment_count": 53, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38422130": {"recommendationid": "38422130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061115484", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511586778}, "language": "english", "review": "ob64 lul", "timestamp_created": 1513650211, "timestamp_updated": 1513650211, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.682190895080566406", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25638421": {"recommendationid": "25638421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072011145", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 180013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 312, "last_played": 1551775263}, "language": "english", "review": "It's ok.", "timestamp_created": 1474565350, "timestamp_updated": 1526352053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.71752321720123291", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48580664": {"recommendationid": "48580664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043989243", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 258984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548554888}, "language": "english", "review": "It's really sad to not recommend this game, but unfortunately I fear the game might be close to its end, mainly because of the developers that care nothing for their own game. All they do is promote skins and events with no foundation. I know its a free game and they need to make money, but to shove content in our faces is not the way to do it.\n\nInstead of actually doing what the community asks, bug fixing, quality improvements, champion balance, matchmaking, and so many more, but little to no effort seems to be put on that, the gameplay is horrible due to bugs QoL issues and extremely poor optimization. \"Oh so you have a 1080Ti on your setup to run the game smoothly on high settings? Well too bad, because you won't even be able to run the game smoothly on low settings either. Something will always drop your framerate on this 2015 game made on Unreal Engine 3. You're welcome\".\n\nIn my country there is a big issue with ping on the game in the past 2 months, they've announced to have fixed the issue last patch, but the problem persists. I checked other games and the cennection with them is fine.\n\nI've been playing the game ever since open beta on steam (September 2016). I play the game casually and competitively, I also watch every single patch update to see what's coming and what changes. I've seen the game's highs and lows, and even on the lows I was hopeful that it would come back again to be a better game, the developers always saying that would improve the quality of the game, but the only thing they do is shove skins, skins and more skins on your face so you can buy and give money to them. Well let me ask, why would you bother buying a skin in a game that you can't even play properly? Why would you bother buying a skin that can even bug in the game (Yes, some skins bug the game, especially with sounds)?\n\nNow the balance. I-T-'-S  T-O-T-A-L-L-Y  M-E-S-S-E-D  U-P. It looks like it was made by a ten year old child. Some champions become good, then are nerfed to the ground which makes them being throw picks even in casuals. Some champions are incredibly strong, the community asks for nerfs or reworks on them, and they buff the champion even more, just like Dredge in the last few patches. And the matchmaking, both in casuals and competitive are terrible. It doesn't matter if you\u00b4re in Diamond or Masters, you\u00b4ll get people below platinum in your games, and sometimes even players that just got the requirements to play competitive (level 15 and 15 champions acquired), which means that they know little to nothing about the game mechanics, because the tutorial only teaches you that you have to shoot and cap the point, that's it. No explaining about the item store, no explaining about the loadouts, no explaining about the roles in the game. If you want to know more about the game you have to search online. And the casuals are even worse, with beginners, trolls, crashes, BOTS, MATCHMAKING. Its all a mess.\n\nThe game has its good parts, but the bad parts are the ones that show up the most and end up kill the game. And what the developers do? nothing. They even made an initiative called The Hunt, to try and solve most of the problems of the game, but even helping them DOING THEIR JOB, they do little, to not say nothing, because there are bugs present in the game for more than 2 years, that are REPORTED hundreds of times and NEVER fixed. Also there still no report for cheating option on a first person shooter that has been requested a lot? Well done Hi-Rez or Evil Mojo, whatever.\n\nI really loved this game, but in its current state its unplayable, that all I feel now is hate and disgust for it. I spent more than 2 years playing this game, having fun in the beginning, meeting awesome and awful people, then trying to stand it for as long as I could recently. It was good while it lasted.

However, if you can spy on this happening in competitions, who says people can't spy on your login information or even worse: paypal or credit card information from in-game purchases? Just look at what happened with Robocraft, and how the devs tried to cover it up. If you respect your privacy, I highly suggest you not respect Hi-Rez or this game.

Playerbase is still good but it has definately started to decline losing around 3,000 players in the last month according to steam stat websites.\n\nSome of the bugs that have been ignored were openly present in the Premiere League streams these past couples weeks and the announcers trying their best to avoid talking about them. It was pretty embarrassing and awkward. \n\nMost recently they have been making questionable balance changes to the game. This includes buffing and nerfing in areas where its not needed. Not listening to top players concerns and Introducing drastic gameplay and champion changes in a game that has been in open beta for over a year now.\n\nSome balance changes have been good but others have almost completely removed champions from comp play. It's not even the same game it was 30 days ago especially with the most recent two patches OB60 and OB61.\n\nThey are basically keeping the beta / early access slogan at this point as an excuse for the existing bugs that are going unfixed. With the amount of skins and other content that requires real life money to obtain that has been released in the past few months it is hard to consider this a game in beta anymore.\n\nSome of these bugs are very old but we have plenty of new skins which cost real life $$$ though!

No, no, no, it is far from it. Character customization is brilliant, as is character progression. You can equip these loadout cards in-game that give your character different buffs, and rank up your defensive or offensive capabilities during a match, based on how the match is going; the more credits you earn during a match, the faster you can improve your character for that one match. Paladins pioneered this system. Games like Gigantic took their cues from this game right here.\n\nCustomization is great. Most weapon skins and cosmetics you can buy with gold, which you farm for by participating in matches. The more friends you play with, the more gold you are rewarded (so bring a friend!). More exclusive items are bought with crystals, which are awarded to you through daily login rewards. If you are impatient, you can buy crystals, but YOU DO NOT HAVE TO. It all depends on how patient you are. (Personally, I have no problem with you endorsing this game. Hi-Rez maintains and adds new content onto the game on a regular basis, and it is worth supporting their balls-to-the-wall efforts.)   \n\nHow about queue times? Between 30 seconds and 1 minute. Sometimes longer. Kinda frustrating. \n\nVisual quality? Okay. I mean, this game could run on a Macintosh if you wanted it to run badly enough. Graphics aren't bad, they just aren't stunning. It would be nice if there was a bit of a texture overhaul. Objects look blurry even on maximum settings and it's a bit sad for those with killer machines.\n\nBut lordy-lord is matchmaking fun!

It has had some rocky changes over the years, but the truly horrible ones were reversed and it is now in its so-called \"final form\".\n\n[h1]What is Paladins?[/h1]\nPaladins is an objective-based hero shooter, similar to Overwatch and TF2. Players capture a point by standing on it, and then lead a payload into the enemy base by standing near it, all while killing and repelling enemy players. This is a team-based game, with five players per team\u2014though you can choose to play against/with AI if you want. [i](Actually, your first five levels you will only play against AI, as training. It goes by pretty quick.)[/i]\n\nOne of the greatest tools in Paladins is the Talent & Loadout system. Each allows you customize your characters abilities and base stats to better suit your style of play. In many cases, this can allow you to hybridize a character's class [i](frontline, support, damage, flank)[/i], or to counter your opposing team's comp. There is also a basic in-match item shop, with basic buffs like resistance to damage, bonus damage to shields, or faster movement speed.\n\n[h1]Community[/h1]\nKeep in mind that I do not play ranked when the reading the below.\n\nThe community is active, and I personally enjoy frequently visiting the subreddit for art posts and balance discussions [i](although there is a proclivity towards complaining and memeing)[/i]. The playerbase is large enough to have low queue times, at least in NA.\n\nIn-game, there is a voice chat, but it is seldom used, and can be turned off completely in settings. Instead, most players use a mixture of the text chat and the VGS system. The VGS system allows players to quickly send out messages by pressing three or four keys. For example:[list][*][b]VVGN[/b]: Nice job![*][b]VHS[/b]: Need healing![*][b]VA1[/b]: Flank left![/list]These commands will either use the voice of the default announcer, or the champion's voicepack [i](see below)[/i].\n\nThere is some toxicity, but I've only encountered it every four or five matches. It is generally pretty easy to ignore, due to the preferred communication tools of the community.\n\n[h1]Business Model[/h1]\nThere are no pay-to-win mechanics in the final version of the game. All cards are available from the start, and each hero's talents are unlocked as that hero is levelled up. That being said, free players wanting to use champions not in the free rotation will have to grind for them. All champions [i](present and future)[/i] can be unlocked through a single purchase.\n\nMost cosmetics are locked behind loot chests, though they do also have some skins available for direct purchase. Many skins have unique voicepacks. THAT BEING SAID, each champion's voicepacks must be unlocked through a purchase\u2014one purchase will unlock the voicepacks for a single champion, including the default voice and all owned skins' voices.\n\nPremium currency is regularly awarded to free players, but not in large quantities.\n\n[h1]Comparisons to Overwatch[/h1]\nI play both games. [i]A lot.[/i] I've also spent about the same amount of money on both.\n\nWhile I do enjoy both, ultimately I prefer Paladins. Here are some of the reasons why:\n[list][*]Overwatch's heros are all extremely specialized, with tight mechanical designs. There is a lot more overlap between characters in Paladins, which has two benefits: [b]1)[/b] it is easier to flex between characters, and [b]2)[/b] it is easier to take on multiple roles.\n[*]The customization systems are great, and make up for the fact that you're locked into one champion the whole match.\n[*]Both frontlines and supports spend more time fighting than holding up a shield and healing, respectively. Unless you design their loadout specifically for shielding and healing, that is, which is rarely optimal.\n[*]There's a much larger pool of champions.[/list]\n\nNow, it is much less polished and far buggier than Overwatch, and I doubt that will change.

Like MVM mode in [i]Team Fortress 2[/i], you're also allowed to purchase in-game powerups with earnable match currency (exclusive to that match only).\n\nYou also get gold (and sometimes crystals) on daily login.  Gold is the free currency of [i]Paladins[/i], which can be used to purchase purely cosmetic things.  Crystals, however, are the paid currency that can be used to change your name, purchase other cosmetics, and to purchase chests (Much like TF2 keys, except these crates auto-open after being purchased and selected).\n\nThe only flaws right now include some nerfing / buffing that needs to be done here and there along with a clear lack of content.

The game has become much more polished, and I'm amazed at the progress.\n\nThe gameplay is awesome. The TTK isn't insanely low, but not insanely high, either. Think Overwatch, with a slightly longer TTK.\n\nThe scenery is beautiful with the recent map updates. Sometimes I go into bot matches and turn up my graphics settings just to look around.\n\nThe character design could use more originality, but I really like the characters still. Needless to say (if you look at my icon), Pip is my favorite. Very original character, original abilities, authentic personality. Pip isn't the only character like this. Some characters may seem like archtypes, but try to look past that and listen to their voicelines, look at their emotes, and you'll see there's more behind the \"standard sexy female sniper\" that some call Cassie, or the \"cool dragon\" that is Drogoz.\n\nThe ranked system and balance, unfortunately, is quite subpar. The ranked system (as of writing this) is entirely based on champs. There is no account rank, only champ ranked. Because of this, you get people that dodge because they didn't get to pick their favorite champ, and those who ignore team comp to grind their champ to masters.\n\nI think that though this game doesn't look as nice as Overwatch, it is a great buy for those that want a free game, those who want to watch the development process, and those who \"just don't get\" Overwatch playstyles. I couldn't play anything for any game before I picked up Pip, now I'm on the international leaderboards with him.\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]\nPros:\n[list]\n[*] Fun gameplay\n[*] Good-looking maps and scenery\n[*] Interesting characters\n[*] Free\n[/list]\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Not much originality\n[*] Not very many \"balanced\" champs\n[*] Ranked system that promotes grinding a single champion rather than learning the game\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1473983942, "timestamp_updated": 1473983942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 89, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.756556987762451172", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25889870": {"recommendationid": "25889870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091497554", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 13467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1245, "last_played": 1551741914}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Lots of potential[/h1]\nI have played 15 hours of this game, and to be honest, [b]it's worth your time...[/b]\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\nFree to play\nQuick matchmaking\nFast paced\nPlenty of characters\nBeta, so a lot more content to come\nHas a lot of potential\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\nYou can get kicked out the game randomly (*fixed*)\nCharacters need rebalancing especially skye {op} and pip {up}\nThere are not enough maps, there are about 5+ at the moment. I know this is Beta, but the new maps cannot come soon enough for me\n\n[h1]Characters:[/h1]\n[h1]Barik:[/h1] Has too many shields for his own good, can shut down most long range characters and ults with just a shield which to me is frustrating. But then again he is a front line/tanking character.\nAfter 100 hours: Good character, very tanky with the right loadout, but with no team support, he might as well be getting raped behind some dustbins.\n[h1]Fernando:[/h1] I feel that this character would be perfect with a little [b]more speed[/b], or [b]range[/b], or [b]ult duration[/b], or [b]more health[/b]. He's basically a bag of meat that is useless without someone by his side at all times, he seems to not be able to kill anyone [b]at all[/b].\nAfter 100 hours: Borderline op, impossible to take down on your own, especially if you have to get close to him because, in close quarters, he will fuck you up. \n[h1]Makoa:[/h1] I haven't played this hero yet simply because I haven't unlocked him, but he seems like a good tank as long as someone is there to heal him.\nAfter 100 hours: Not really that good of a character. He's basically a single target killing tank, he'll only work if you hook the most valuable targets. He also gets shut down by other shield bearing tanks.\n[h1]Ruckus:[/h1] Someone [b]PLEASE BUFF HIS JETS[/b].... holy fuck they're useless. I'd say buff his jets so that he can fly for 2 seconds at the speed that the jets are at the moment, as long as you are holding the button down. Then make it so that it starts cooling down 3 seconds after using it, then takes a whole 5 seconds to regen back 2 seconds of flight.\nAfter 100 hours: He needs a buff somehow, a health buff to get him on par with other tanks would help. An ok hero, but to be honest, if he's anything more than 1v1ing someone, he'll lose.\n[h1]Bomb king:[/h1] Fun as fuck. If you play this character right, you'll be a literal king, however, I think he'd benefit from a health buff, maybe 2800 health or more, [b]he's a little squishy[/b] in my opinion.\nAfter 100 hours: In the right hands this character is formidable, but those hands aren't mine.\n[h1]Cassie:[/h1] I'd like if the arrows had a charge mechanic, rather than just pinging arrows off the bow. The ult seems a little lackluster as well, but maybe that's just me.\nAfter 100 hours: Now this character is the broken one, taking out teams of people over and over again. Here dps is so good, she team wipes. 700 damage per 0.75 seconds, it's fucking ridiculous. This is the op character right now.\n[h1]Drogoz:[/h1] An [b]overwatch pharah remake[/b] of sorts, [b]but I don't care[/b], I love this dragon to bits. I just wish he had a bigger explosion radius with his rockets, the further you are from the epicenter, the less damage it should do. Then I'll never leave this explosive lizard.\nAfter 100 hours: Still fucking love this lizard, despite his 'salvo' ability being buggy at times and not firing correctly, he is amazingly fun to play, and my main 'goto' hero.  \n[h1]Kinessa:[/h1] [b]A nice sniper class, love it.[/b]\nAfter 100 hours: Deadly if you can aim, 'nough said.\n[h1]Viktor:[/h1] His grenade is a bit funky in physics but, other than that and the run mechanic which seems to be stolen from overwatch, [b]he's a good well-rounded character.[/b]\nAfter 100 hours: his focus fire damage is powerful, I constantly see viktors' topping the kill counts for both teams. Yet he isn't op, just stay out his line of sight.\n[h1]Grohk:[/h1] [b]Meh[/b]. Nothing special, pretty weak healer.\nAfter 100 hours: Meh. He's just meh. Not very fun to play, his aoe heal might as well also constitute him doing something else with his time like being raped behind a dustbin.\n[h1]Grover:[/h1] [b]Great all round healer, the best healer in this game in my opinion.[/b] I wish he had a 20% increase to the stock range of his passive heal, however, maybe make it so that he heals 10% slower as a balance, then I'll love him to the end of time.\nAfter 100 hours: This guy is the best team healer still unless you change the loadout for mal'damba, (many gourds card) then you might be better off than grover. Play mal'damba if you really want single target heals though, he is a beast at that shit.\n[h1]Pip:[/h1] After 125 hours: I should fine tune what I meant originally. [i]He's a [b]waste of space[/b] when he doesn't play with the team & the objective[/i]. [b]This character encourages independent play as a support[/b], which is why I resent Pip so much. I see WAY too many pips playing independently chasing kills that flanks should be, it only works against unorganized brainless teams, which isn't often, thus, we fail because of their incompetence. His heals are also so [b]far a few between[/b], that they only stack up effectively if you're with the rest of the team playing the objective, and even then most skilled healers could do better. Which is why I almost always pick up a healing support role when I see a level 0-15 Pip get picked. [b]I still however believe a [i]Pip rework[/i] is needed to stop this unhelpful independant play.[/b]\n[h1]Ying:[/h1] An ok character, nothing special to be honest. She's a good healer, however, not as good as grover though..\nAfter 100 hours: She's shit. Way too squishy to be out of the front lines. But that's the trouble you see, she needs to be out on the front lines because she's meant to HEAL PEOPLE. I don't mind people going ying as much as I do someone going pip though.\n[h1]Androxus:[/h1] He has great potential in him if you flank correctly, and hit all your shots.\nAfter 100 hours: This guy, you need the right mind set to play him, he just isn't my style at all. He's ok, he's just nowhere near my cup of tea.\n[h1]Buck:[/h1] I don't have buck unlocked at the moment, but I don't see many people playing him at all, there might be a reason for this... with bot encounters however, he does appear majorly underpowered. This character [b]needs a major rework[/b], just like pip, but not quite as badly as pip.\nAfter 100 hours: I take back what I said about Buck, he's good :3 . \n[h1]Evie:[/h1] Yet again, haven't unlocked this hero yet, she seems powerful, however, is a glass cannon, I reckon she's a good all rounded character... if you play her right.\nAfter 100 hours: The highest skill ceilinged character in the game me thinks. \n[h1]Skye:[/h1] Broken, Overpowered, The dps character to beat. She will fuck you if you are a low health class. Something on Skye needs nerfing, she can output a stupid amount of damage, and go invisible, then when you're not looking, she'll place a bomb that has the range of the Hiroshima explosion and at the same time one hit anything with less than 3000 health regardless of shields that are in use at the time.\nAfter 100 hours: She got nerfed with here ult, and she doesn't seem to be much of a problem anymore, I'm happy. With this character, don't go after a full health tank, it won't work, take out the ones easy to pick off, either with low health or low health cap, or take out the healers and snipers of the game like Kenessa and Viktor (He's sort of a sniper lets be honest here).\n[h1]Mal'Damba + Pip cont.:[/h1] http://pastebin.com/VbaWxSjZ\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nA big potential game which has plenty of room to grow, but needs to do so fast to keep people on board, and keep a flux of new players coming in.

Overall, I find it more fun than Overwatch, because of that fast pace and that to counter an enemy team, you buy items to slow them down, rather than changing your hero every 20 seconds. I also enjoy the loadouts, so I can customize the champions to my play style, and I can also search the leaderboards to take inspiritation.\n\nThe game is also fairly balanced, with all champions able to be competively played as long as the player playing them is skilled. Some champions are stronger than others however, and some are weaker, but it isn't a massive problem. The competitive play is also fun, with teams most of the time cooperating and making teams that are balanced and work together.

But for all of those flaws Paladins still comes out as personally one of the best, if not the best, Free to play game.\n\nLets start with the champion pool. There are over 30 champions at the time of writing and are all unique to one another. (yes there are assests from other characters in some of these champions but what game/media doesn't take inspiration!). My personal favourites being Mal Damba, a support witch doctor type character with a snake as a weapon and Moji, a flank rabbit character that rides on a two headed lizard creature which shoots fire and projectile spit. That sounds awesome! And trust me. It is awesome!\n\nThe maps are varied and all have their benefits, each with their own concepts. The maps are pretty and have many points of attack for tactical takeovers.\n\nThe modes in Paladins include, Siege, TDM and Onslaught. Siege is a capture the point and push the payload mix, TDM is TDM lol and Onslaught is Capture and Hold the Point. These modes are very fun and can be enjoyed by many different types of people. The only competitive mode is Siege which makes sense as that is the most tactical and fleshed out mode as it was the base concept for the game.\n\nI could go on for much longer but its wasting valuable time for you to be playing this game.

I was salty about being hardstuck in Diamond cause of the new season 10 meta, and lack of ranked mode changes. I quit the game for several months and I can now return to express my real opinions. \n\nIn all honesty, Overwatch is a much more polished game with a far more rewarding skill based mechanics. Heroes like Genji, Ana, and Widowmaker are three that I enjoyed playing because of their immense skill ceilings, however none of the paladin's cast elicit the same amount of mechanical skill investment compared to their overwatch counterparts \n\nOne thing I have to give Paladin's though is how they deal with roles. Overwatch very much feels like a DPS-centric game. Everyone wants to be the carry, naturally. Everyone wants to feel like they put in the work for the win, however one thing Paladin's does much better than Overwatch is the support role. \n\nOne of the reasons I left Overwatch was because of the lack of support players, even in the ranked mode. I adopted a flex role mentality to compensate and it was really wearing me thin being a \"flex\" and ending up looking like a support main by the end of every season. The reason for this is is due to the fact that many support in overwatch are created with low kill potential and with their main purpose being solely to heal. This makes support in overwatch become more of a duty than something people willingly play. The DPS and tank role in general feel much more thought out and \"fun\" to play because of this, leaving one important role to be reluctantly filled by whichever people end up picking last. \n\nIn Paladins, I feel as if it is the complete opposite. Many of the Paladins supports have great kill potential, are hard to play, and aren't only assets because of their healing. Games are never lacking in support. In Overwatch, I have to pray every game that I get at least one support and not 5 DPS\n\nOverall, Paladin's is a much less polished game in general. Buggy menus, crashing, black screens, etc. But it by no means is a bad game.  It feels like a better alternative to Overwatch in certain aspects, but Overwatch is still the more rewarding game in the end.", "timestamp_created": 1529471698, "timestamp_updated": 1533622703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 230, "votes_funny": 34, "weighted_vote_score": "0.738914966583251953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25777245": {"recommendationid": "25777245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031789936", "num_games_owned": 386, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 13562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1538534791}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]TL;DR at bottom.[/h1]\n\n[h1]While Paladins draws comparisons to [i]another[/i] game that takes inspiration from both the rosters of unique characters with specialized abilities from the MOBA genre, as well as Team Fortress 2's slick, oldschool and stylized FPS look and feel, Paladins comes out on a different end of the same pond.[/h1]\n\nPaladins is a free-to-play Hero Shooter that has a large objective-focus, an arena-shooter-feel, low time-to-kill, can run on potatoes but also looks good on higher graphics, and as any objective-based FPS, your teammates [i]really[/i] want to run all snipers.\n\n[h1]Characters[/h1]\nThe characters are varied, and all of the ones I've played so far (a bit over half the roster) have been fun to play, which is unusual for me for any games with large selections of characters. There's even horizontal progression and you can easily customize your heroes out with your own loadouts, letting you tweak and customize them to play how you'd like them to. There are heroes to play that are very focused in one area, or heroes that are quite good at dual purposes (Pip and Waifu!). There's a character style for everyone: \n[list]\n[*]if you like aiming (Cassie, Kinessa, Androxus), or you like not aiming (Drogoz I suppose)\n[*]if you like sneaky times (Skye)\n[*]if you like being tanky (Ferrrrrnando)\n[*]if you like minisentries (Barik)\n[*]if you am Groot (Groot -- Grover)\n[*]if you're lonely and you've always dreamed of your very own WAIFU (Waifu... [i]fine[/i] her name is Ying technically)\n[*]if you want to press a button for a gauranteed pentakill (Skye)\n[*]or perhaps if you like killing half of the players in the game repeatedly and healing the other half (also repeatedly) while you solo the objective and [b]turn people into CHICKENS[/b] (Pip), there's that too.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay itself is very fast and fluid, and the maps offer a variety of ways to flank yet at the same time focusing players through chokepoints that create tense team battles and last stands. The two game modes that are currently out offer different styles of maps as well, with Siege being generally smaller and more focused, and Payload having larger maps with sprawling flank routes. Hit detection feels very good most of the time, though much of this can be attributed to that everything has really large hitboxes.\n\n[h1]TEAMMATES Y R U DO THIS?![/h1]\nThe game is ridiculously fun, but much of your gameplay will be dragged down simply by your teammates. This isn't a Paladins problem, just any game that has objectives in it. If you like playing the objective, well, you're going to have to do it for your team. Like playing flank or sniper? Well you have to also be tank and take the point. Like playing support? Well you're going to have to take the point AND do all of the damage for your team, because even though the hitboxes are the size of a Lost Planet alien thus making sniping trivially ridiculously easy, [i] your 4 flankers and snipers on your team can't kill a single person without you doing most of the work[/i]. It'd be nicer to have a large amount of incentive to take objectives, as well as make it glaringly obvious, but until then I'd recommend brining a friend or four with you.\n\n[h1]Business Model[/h1]\nLet's get this clear: the game is [i]really[/i] generous. As a gamer I'd say almost [i]too[/i] generous, at least until there's more of, well, everything. You can get any hero you want and get them decked out in a full custom loadout by only playing a few games. You can get cosmetics (mostly recolors) also through the in-game currency, or get better ones that are actually pretty unique and awesome from the myriad of promotions and giveaways. Almost half of the heroes are free straight up, and they're all good ones. The game has progression somewhat, but it's just so... [i]fair[/i] and easy. We need more things to get! I assume this will be remedied soon though, as the last update already added a ton of new stuff.\n\n[h1]Developers and Content[/h1]\nFinally, the developers and the development.\n\nI think this explains everything right here:\nhttps://youtu.be/f-GuMIN5aaY\n\nThe devs are pretty fun guys and do talk on the subreddit as well. Hi-Rez has both a good and bad past, but their last entry Smite is still going quite strong as far as I know, and now they have Paladins which is their largest yet.\n\nThe content in the game right now is much better with the last update, which doubled the game modes to 2, added new maps, a new hero, and lots of things were polished. If we keep seeing updates like these, then the game will be in even better shape in not too long.\n\n[h1]TL;DR: With its objective-based gameplay, the amount of people playing snipers; its refined, quick-to-kill, fluid arena shooter feel; and its sense of accessible but customizable progression, as well as its huge accessibility in being only a 4gb download and being entirely free to play, this game fills its own unique spot in a sprouting game genre and right now is a really, [i]really[/i] good time to hop into it. I think it's a more different game than you think that I know that you think that I think that you do.[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1475216240, "timestamp_updated": 1475261906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 218, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.825823605060577393", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "41961005": {"recommendationid": "41961005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172347455", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1533793111}, "language": "english", "review": "run smoothly on my potato laptop\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1525952940, "timestamp_updated": 1525952940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.699005842208862305", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42022889": {"recommendationid": "42022889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092612877", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 42709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1324, "last_played": 1551868089}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd figure since this game is finally going out of beta let's just be a bit meme-ish and compare this to OW\n\nSorta joking but I'm just gonna do a quick comparison between my experience with OW and this. I'll be doing short comparisons on gameplay, sound, performance, visuals, and \"social\" potential.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nI honestly found Paladins significantly easier than Overwatch has ever been, like legit, I can easily get top 3 with kills using a support and most of the time I'm the most useful in Paladins. Sometimes easily getting 10-20+ kills as a flanker (Maeve best girl fuck u fite me) while getting less then double digits in deaths.\n\nOverwatch however, if I were to take a similar flanker like Genji just switch the numbers around and dial it down a bit and more or less the opposite of good.\n\nNow I think Paladins is easier because of the ways you can heal in the game, in Overwatch your choices of healing are either a skill from a character, your supports or finding med packs.\n\nPaladins consists of your skill from a character, items you can buy to help heal, skill cards or just not getting involved in combat for a couple seconds grants you healing.\n\nBut this section mostly depends on what you like, I personally prefer not being over reliant on supports to keep me alive however some might not.\n\n[b]Sound[/b]\nSo the thing with Paladins is that sound wise it's still relatively buggy, when games end you might hear repeats of a certain gun being shot repeatedly and the bug even happens sometimes during top plays. Those aren't really big issues but it just sorta drags down the presentation over all. This isn't really a problem for Overwatch as far as my couple hundred games recall.\n\nI think this is where Paladins loses this round. Imo. Overwatch simply just has a much better way of letting players take advantage of paying attention to their surroundings, something that Paladins is somewhat lacking. While yes both games let you be aware of who's shooting at what direction at the most part Overwatch just handles it better. Simply due to how Overwatch actually has a mechanic where the enemy actively actually is meant to sound louder than your teammates, not too any drowning degree but it's there and blends in pretty well overall. Even things like enemy footsteps can help you try indicating where they're coming from time to time.\n\n[b]Performance[/b]\nRunning this on a 1070/7700HQ/16GB Ram\nAnd I gotta give this to Paladins, while this is purely an anacdotal section Paladins just simply runs better for me all around. I'm consistently capable of keeping 100+ FPS, mostly 120 90% regardless of what's going.\n\nOverwatch on the other hand nets me some rather jarring FPS on occasions, sometimes going from around 100 to 60-70.\n\nHowever one thing to note is that I think alt tabbing too much can destroy your current Paladins. It seems like the more I alt tab in the game the worst performance got. I actually got to the point where I was getting 30FPS maxed for whatever reason.\n\n[b]Visuals[/b]\nVisually speaking, Overwatch. While visuals are subjective it's really hard for anyone to say \"I prefer Paladins' art style over OW's\" without being a blind a fanboy, everything from maps, to hero designs just has an instant level of \"wow this is unique\" to it. I never really went to a Paladins' map and thought \"wow this looks really good\". \n\n[b]Social[/b]\nThis is actually the segment which actually made want to do this \"sorta review\"\nI feel like Paladins should really learn from Blizzard on how to make chat work in a game.\n\nPaladins has little too much lacking that I got spoilt with from Overwatch\n- Overall limited chat\nOkay so when I played OW on occasions I can even make jokes around with the enemies and sometimes they actually do become my friends in game due to how there's a pretty big social reach there.\nI can chat with my team, everyone in the match and whoever else I want to by just pressing tab and swapping between chats.\n\nThis isn't really possible in Paladins, in Paladins you only get to talk to your team in a round of Paladins and you're somewhat limited in that regard. \n\nAnd what decade do we live in where I have to consistently go /r message (username) (content) just to reply? Seriously? Where again, in OW you can just press tab tab tab tab to switch between chats on the go that's not possible in Paladins.\n\n- There's also no way to spectate your friends (at least as far as Ik) which sorta sucks when you decide you wanna play with your RL friend but he or me doesn't really know how long a match the other friend is going on for. \n\n- hell you can't even chat when a top play is replaying. Which is again, something that OW spoiled me with. Where you can instantly react to what happened in a POTG/Top Play instead of waiting until you get back to the end game lobby.\n\n+ There are a lot less quitters mid game in Paladins than OW.\nSoo... if anyone's actually been playing OW recently you'd actually notice that a lot of people quit pre-emptively before the game even ends just because they died one too many times. However I don't really think this is  a problem for Paladins since you're forced to play the game or quit and wait for it to finish before you can just go \"quit match > Find quick match > Join game > repeat\"\n\n\nPrice of admission:\n40$ or... 0$\n\nWell that was easy.\n\n[b]Extra tidbits I like that OW has but Paladins doesn't:[/b]\n- I do like how Overwatch lets you see other player profiles so you can see what a player mained/mains just so you can get a better understanding of their skill. \n- Speaking of, you can't really see how well you've been improving/worsening either, you can see a set amount of previous game stats like win/win/win/loss/win for about 15-20-ish? games. But that's about it\n- You can't see stuff like your stats for this mode, your win/loss ratio, not overall or with a certain character. Overwatch lets you see indivual win/loss rates for a single character and time played with said character.\n- You also can't individual configure keybinds/sensitivity for indivual characters. Something, again. Overwatch lets you do. So, you wanna use J/K/I/L as your movement keys for this certain hero? There ya go.\n\n\nWhile I do think Overwatch is the overall better game I've actually grown to like Paladins, maybe it's because my aim and skills don't actually look like dog shit in comparison but I do believe it really does need a bit more polish here and there,really question why you'd release it out of beta to begin with.
