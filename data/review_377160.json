Movement and gun usage feel organic and satisfying, closer to what one would expect in a FPS game. The crafting mechanic is also greatly expanded compared to previous games, with the ability to craft modifications for weapons and armour, adding to the immersion of the game. Crating also plays an important role in the new settlement mechanic, where furniture, farms, walls and defences can be built around certain areas. This is a welcome and interesting step that adds variety to the game. \n\nWhile it is more satisfying to use guns in Fallout 4, gameplay is significantly hampered by how cluttered environments can seem. The fact that everything, from screwdrivers to coffee cups, can be potentially needed in crafting encourages a hoarder-like gameplay where every single container is checked. This significantly slows down the pace of gameplay and interrupts the process of being able to appreciate the environment. Complicating this is the prevalence of special loot,  which are often hidden in unassuming places. They often offer permanent character upgrades, making it unpalatable to miss them, yet the cluttered areas in Fallout 4 make it a nightmare to comb for them. \n\nCompared to previous games, the lighting and general environment of Fallout 4 are a lot brighter, making the world a lot more appealing to play in. However, exploration quickly becomes tiring when one realises that settlements are extremely rare, with new areas usually resulting in more enemies to fight, rather than new characters to meet. Even then, the amount of interactions offered with settlers is very limited and disappointing.\n\nDialogue in Fallout 4 is bad. Options are summarised and presented in a wheel, and can often be misleading in terms of what the character actually says. The choices themselves tend to be fairly limited, as are the opportunities to meaningfully define the identity of the character through what they say. A lack of meaningful dialogue is also seen in the poor development of NPCs in Fallout 4, as there is usually little opportunity to discuss their background or ideas.\n\nWhile there is an attempt by Bethesda to create morally 'grey' choices in the game, with all factions having some form of negative, this does not succeed in creating meaningful narrative choices because the factions (and the ideas they represent) are poorly created. Often it seems that the 'negatives of a faction are shoehorned in just for the sake of having moral 'greyness'. This is most evident for the Institute, which just seems to be a trope of 'science gone wrong without limits'. If there were more opportunities to talk with NPCs, and perhaps understand how the ideology of a faction might be flawed, the themes and choices in Fallout 4 would seem a lot more meaningful as they would be more well developed.\n\nQuests in Fallout 4 have an even more overbearing feel of 'fetch quests' where something is reached or retrieved at a location after killing the enemies in the way. While it is true that most quests in RPG games, when boiled down, are fetch quests, this is usually hidden by adding multiple stages to the quest, as well as layers of interesting scenarios, environments and characters. The fact that quests in this game seem so much like fetch quests is testament to how poorly the previously mentioned factors are done. \n\nOverall, many of the core elements of Fallout franchise (dialogue, choices, themes) are poorly done in Fallout 4.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1550320297, "timestamp_updated": 1550320297, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580836832523345947", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49194358": {"recommendationid": "49194358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060527161", "num_games_owned": 364, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 2270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 117, "last_played": 1550880524}, "language": "english", "review": "Fallout 4 should be a fine game, yet I'm probably 1/10th the way through the story and 1/3 the way through the game's content and I can't bring myself to keep playing.\n\nAs a shooter, it's fine. There's nothing necessarily wrong with it, but it's not fantastic. Enemies are more interesting than in previous games, since they have better AI and unique abilities. The first time I saw mole-rats jump out of the ground was fantastic.\n\nThe settlement builder is fine. Buildings, resources and the systems at work make sense. You can ignore settlement raids if you don't want to deal with them. And building a base from which you can do all your crafting and is reasonably well-defended doesn't take much time, effort or thought. \n\nIt does neither of these well, though. There's nothing compelling about either the shooting or the settlement building.\n\nAs far as story goes, it's been okay so far. Nothing we haven't heard before, but better than an excuse plot. The companions are a total upgrade from previous Bethesda companions, having better personalities and more interesting and unique things to say at unique locations. It makes them more interesting to travel with, and it's the first time I actually cared to have companions with me in a Bethesda game, so I gotta give them props for that.\n\nUnfortunately, this game suffers from what I'd call Unfocused Mechanic Syndrome. It wants to be open-world, an FPS, an RPG, and tell a specific story. Unfortunately, I think they ran into limitations on what they could realistically put into the game, and ended up gutting some of the RPG elements so they could include things they thought would be cool. \nLike the weapon mod system. Great idea on paper to be able to take your weapons and mod them yourself so you can play the game the way you want - have an excess of 10mm ammo? Make your stealthed pistol into an uzi with a drum mag! \nUnfortunately, it ends up making all weapons feel the same with about 5 variations depending on your goal - short-range DPS (usually a shotgun or machine gun), long-range DPS (a rifle), short-range silenced, long-ranged silenced, or missiles. \nYep.\nThere's no more unique weapons or weapons with interesting effects because you've basically been given a few guns with sliders on them and told to make them the way you like them. Some of them are straight-up more powerful than the others, but if you want to use your plasma sniper rifle as a machine gun, you can. Sounds great on paper. Makes finding new weapons feel as boring as pumping a 'strength' stat.\nIn short, they traded unique weapons for player customizibility.\n\nCharacter leveling, too. They locked a bunch of mechanics behind the 'perks' you need when you level up, and made many of the others straight boosts to a certain kind of weapon damage. Sounds fine on paper. But with no changes in game mechanics to alter how you play the game, just the damage you do or if you can pick that lock, it makes the game feel the same whether you're level 7 or level 70.\nIn short, they traded an interesting perk system for a simplified one that extended playtime through unlocking content that shouldn't have been locked to begin with.\n\nThe quests. ...No, the world. New Vegas had several towns where people lived, and then the wilds. The wilds were home to wanderers like yourself, adventurers who plundered the treasures of the wasteland and would continue to do so until they died or the wilds were tamed. In this game, the towns and wilds are mushed together and consequently muddled. \nYou don't really have towns except for what you build yourself and get generic six-line \"Settler\" NPCs to inhabit, so there's fewer interesting NPCs and the towns feel bland. They're built out of locations in the wilds, which means you'll usually find yourself walking through a poorly-constructed prefab base from which you're supposed to create your own, and everything you can collect in the world is now fodder to build that base into a town. You're no longer wandering on your own, you're carrying the bland and disinteresting towns with you as you constantly scavenge more resources and clear more similar-looking settlement locations. \nIn short, they traded the unique locations for the ability to build towns full of generic buildings and NPCs.\n\nNote what's happening here: all of the uniqueness is gone. Unique weapons, perks, NPCs, player characters, locations, towns, and quests - and this happened because they were trying to add new systems that didn't gel with the old ones. They saw the systems clashing, they knew something had to be cut - and they decided to try to get a little of everything, rather than maintaining focus.  \nThat doesn't work. Fallout should have been an RPG, not sim-city. Find one thing that you can do, and do it well - not a bunch of things that only work halfway. \n\nFallout 4 isn't a bad game, but it isn't good. It had enormous potential, but too many conflicting systems and hardcoded rules gutted most of it.", "timestamp_created": 1550948506, "timestamp_updated": 1551221808, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657186448574066162", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48995384": {"recommendationid": "48995384", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970383187", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 49632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550140599}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 Because it's better than Fallout 76.", "timestamp_created": 1550182518, "timestamp_updated": 1550182518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 79, "votes_funny": 50, "weighted_vote_score": "0.719436764717102051", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48803082": {"recommendationid": "48803082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198336326911", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 12396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2004, "last_played": 1551852963}, "language": "english", "review": "This was the first Fallout game I played, and I can now confidently say that, after having played the other ones (the one I've played the least is actually New Vegas, what do you know.), this hardly even counts.

And the sad part is that, much like people have pointed out, the game itself would be much better if it didn't have the name attached to it.\n\nI love the companions, I love that Codsworth can say my very common name, I love the gunplay, I love the general art style and the detail of the world, I love some locations in the map, certain quests, the crafting and settlement system, I love that you get certain comments depending on what you do, and I love this game to pieces, but the thing is, almost none of these reasons are very much like Fallout, and if you can manage to get past that initial shock and distaste, you might find there's quite a lot to like. Maybe, I'm not your mother. Maybe it would have been better if you had played it before every other Fallout game to just appreciate it for what it is, which is not a compliment, due to its other glaring issues (the perk system, dialogue, lack of focus in role-playing, etcetera). But nobody can stop me from enjoying this game. So fight me. \n\nAlso, Nick Valentine. That's a plus. He's every lady who played this game's universal crush. Oh, and the silver shroud quest.

The main story was captivating and kept me interested (Not wanting to focus on side quests like in Skyrim, they were better in my opinion excluding DLC). Speaking of which, the DLC for Fallout 4 is awesome, I got so much more than what I thought I was paying for, I purposely hid sneak peaks and summaries so I could come into it with a fresh mind. I especially liked Far Harbor in particular which may have gotten a little deeper than I would have originally liked but it quickly grew on me. As for the main game I really enjoyed the factions you got to choose from and all the different endings that you got out of them. I especially liked the Brotherhood of Steel ending which I felt was a justified ending and got really emotional.

Sometimes the dialog felt like I wasn't getting a lot of choices and the game crashed a lot! I was genuinely frustrated to the point where I just wanted to give up but like many of the other games in Fallout and Elder Scrolls, mods, and mod managers combined with removing autosave functions helped significantly.

Textures, terrain details, color and lighting enhancements, better character customization not saying the base game character customization is terrible just that it can be better.

The downside however is the lack of 'RPG' which not only defines a Fallout title, but also any game produced by Bethesda Game Studios. I believe this is because of the move towards a more mainstream audience thus 'dumbing' down the game in order for it to appeal to a wider range of consumers. There are plenty of choices to be made when playing the game, however most of them have little to no impact and sometimes 2 different choices will often end up having the same result. Unlike it's predecessors, Fallout 4 has no karma system and almost forces the player into being the good guy which is a very restrictive move by the developers for a game that's supposed to be an RPG. Apart from this, the quests, gun-play, characters, voice acting, exploration and world building are all solid with the settlement builder being one of my favourite features (especially with mods). On the subject of mods. I currently play with over 160 installed, all of which improve and expand upon the game in one way or another, and add features which should have been in the game to begin with. Unfortunately, the story is more of the same but Bethesda manages to keep it interesting especially with a few different plot twists down the line.\nOverall, It's an enjoyable game to play and has plenty of content especially with the GOTY edition which comes with 6 DLC packs, 2 of which expand greatly upon the game with new land to explore.

You get the power armour straight away which you can basically wear the entire game because powering it is incredibly easy The game play is O.K. Like Fallout 3 and New Vegas in which the gameplay was also just O.K. Where the other Fallout games stood out to me was the characters, stories and the real feeling of being put into a living breathing world.\nThe story and characters in Fallout 4? Hot garbage. Why did they think giving the main character a voice was a good idea? Why are dialogue options restricted to a simplified dumbed mass effect wheel? Why did you add outposts? Why do we get the power armor straight away? The hardest creature in the game (Deathclaw) is rekt by us after getting power armor in the first 15 minutes of the game???? HELLO BETHESDA? DESIGN CHOICES?? It feels like its trying soooo hard to create \"Fallout moments\" just like how all modern Battlefield games try to create \"Battlefield moments\". \nThe game literally starts out with \"This is your son, this is your wife, you love them! Oh no, now your wife is dead and your son is taken, you are angry! Go and get em!\".

But decided to switch to the P.C. This game is good. Just good, \"but why is it thumbed down?\" I hear you saying, it's because it's not a good Fallout game, I know I know, I hate what I'm saying as well but hear me out. Fallout 3 for me was the peak of Fallout, I know some say it's New Vegas but to them I say, Exploration. anyway, the previous games had a sense of choice, you could say certain things depending on your Character traits, let's say you were really smart, a prompt would show up when you spoke to an NPC, this NPC was threatening you, you could defuse the situation using  your intelligence. same with perception, in one scenario a Raider could come to you and if you had a high enough perception you could notice that the gun is unloaded or broken and He'll back off. but there is a distinct lack of that in fallout 4, all the player dialogue is just variations of yes, no, mean, happy. with a slight sarcastic tone. Also in the previous games you could change the tide of the game with one decision. Want to save the wasteland by bringing fresh water? NO. KILL THEM ALL! bam no more quests for that part. You want to blow up the first city? you can! but think it's not really important? well just know, when you blow it up you kill off everyone (except one who turns into a ghoul) you blow up. Multiple quest givers, a player house, a follower and the only person able to jump start the main quest. now you have no quest marker telling you where to go. but at least you have 500 caps and a nice hotel room. but fallout 4...what can you do? you do mildly mean things but that's about it. your on a straight path. very linear. also the fact that the main character speaks (the person you play as) takes away what role playing elements it had left. it blocks you from creating a personality. if elder scrolls or fallout 3/ New Vegas did that I wouldn't have been able to create Vognar the Red or Victor Redmond. who became unique people.

and its been too long to request a refund so im sadly deleting it from my pc forever, which is kinda sad even despite all my troubles because the xbox just dosnt have the modding capacity like EMBs

Nothing. \n\nWant to get those and those perks? You don't really need any perks at all. \nWant to plan and build awesome bases? You can't because you'll hit the build limit. \nWant to build flawless defenses? Enemies will spawn in middle of your settlement.\nWant to gear up your settlers for autonomy? They are useless defending themselves.\nWant to modify your weapons and armor? Modifications are dirt cheap at stores.\nWant to hunt legendary loot? Enemies are already weak, so loot is unneccessary.\nWant to hack computers, pick locks? Useless minigames to waste time.\nWant to search everywhere just in case? It's not worth it, it's all same mediocrity.\nWant to enjoy some quests? Dialogue is inane and quests redundant.\nWant to think it gets better, finally something behind next corner? It never does, there never is. \n\nI want to enjoy the world, characters, exploration, quests, but I can't. There is nothing to explore since every location is same as another. From what I've gathered enemies and containers are just lootboxes that scale to your level and have couple of value differences that alter its contents slightly. You can spend huge amount of points to picking locks, hacking and scrounging which basically gains you slightly more of these lootboxes that are already overbearing.\n\nIf I mod the game, delete all the annoying characters that keep repeating the same lines and hammering the walls, forget the quests, build my base without limits, spawn hordes of enemies outside of settlement borders and watch them try my defenses, I might enjoy the game a little.

Theres no real indications of player \"Special\" stats effecting the play through at all like in past games with the low intelligence runs you could do.\n\nThe game looks amazing but it loses points with me due to the texture pop ins on Ultra high settings, The game is also very dully coloured, everything is pretty much grey and brown, its been 200+ years since the bombs fell, not everything should be completely *BORING*.\n\nThe weapon and armor options are awesome, but theres a lack of unique looking unique weapons and even then unique rewards you can get arent that impressive as you can find weapons with better legendary upgrades than the uniques.\n\nThe companions are awesome, each one has a story and perk and they like and dislike things the player does and says, so a huge plus, i just have to ask why they cut the ability to have dogmeat /and/ a human companion, thankfully its easily fixed with mods.\n\nThe story overall is okay, but the endings are terrible, what happened to being able to force different factions to work together? What happened to finding out to all the other factions in the game? it loses points for me for that.\n\nSo, while ive had a ton of fun with this game, it really does make me question Bethesdas future and my future with their games.

Fo4 effectually forgets everything that fans of the series loved in the originals, New Vegas, and even Bethesda's own Fallout 3; trading that out for an experience more akin to Borderlands than any other mainline Fallout release. I'm not outright saying that Fallout 4 is a terrible game, it's far from it, but it's simply not the game Fallout and RPG fans rightly expected.\n\nFallout 4 starts with an excellently produced opening cinematic explaining the state of the world in the year 2077, and then you are quickly transitioned to a married couple living in Boston, Massachusetts. From here you choose either the husband or the wife to play as, and then customize the look of your character to your liking. After a bit more exposition, you find yourself running with your spouse (your infant in their arms), to a vault as sirens blare that the nuclear apocalypse has finally come. Due to events unspoiled in this review, you emerge 210 years later - the sole survivor of Vault 111 - on a mission to reconnect with your missing child, who is no longer in the vault when you emerge.\n\nAs exciting as that opening-plot summary may have sounded, any veteran of the Fallout series would be able to quickly identify countless problems with it. Fallout has always been a franchise about creating your own character who finds their own motivations in a devastated world, with seemingly innumerable options. None of that is true in Fallout 4 however, because the character you play as will always be from before the apocalypse, have had a spouse at some point, have a child, be either a military vet (the husband) or a lawyer (the wife), and will swear an oath at the onset of the game to find their child, which should make all other content meaningless until you have. This kills one of the most iconic aspects of the Fallout series; player [i]narrative[/i] freedom. It's the basis for why I've not recommended this game, as it's the first domino to fall that proves Fo4 is not a [i]Fallout[/i] RPG, which will be explained further.\n\nSwitching to something more positive; I think Fallout 4 looks superb. The textures and faces are just passable, but the lighting(+godrays), modeling, animation, and artistic design of the Boston ruins are all visually stunning. The game even performs markedly well for a Bethesda title, apart from some FPS drops in the downtown areas. There were several bugs on release, but most of those issues are fixed now. For once, I have no major complaints about the performance of a Fallout game.\n\nAnother favorable aspect of Fo4, would be the irrefutably improved combat when compared to prior entries in the series. The shooting is now both precise and reactive, and the AI is clever enough to have some self-preservation instincts. Most fights are undertaken while exploring, and as for the exploration, I'd say it's just as good as you'd expect from any Bethesda game. The world is full of interesting places, and most of the best moments in the game are bred through this pairing of combat and exploration. However, there is one caveat to these mechanics.\n\nThe issue I have with the combat/exploration duo; is the horseshoe design of most of Fallout 4's dungeons. This is to say, the type of design Skyrim had that circled you back around to the main entrance at the end of each interior level. This is an okay design choice within itself, but considering this is Fallout, where the places you explore are meant to be realistic settings, the horseshoe level structure gets repetitive, and by consequence, immersion breaking - early on in the game. Otherwise, the broader world design suffers no such gameplay errors though.\n\nThe last encouraging thing I have to say about Fo4, is that the power armor, crafting, and settlement systems are all awesome. Power armor is finally given the depiction it deserves, as it's now less of a normal armor type and more of a vehicle that the player drives. The crafting utilizes nearly every miscellaneous item from the game, allowing them to be broken down for components to modify weapons and armor, and to build settlements. The new settlement system is basic, but thematically makes sense in the world of Fallout, as it shows people attempting to rebuild civilization and organize societies for their own well-being. While I don't agree that gameplay gimmicks are where Fallout should target its energy, these systems are well constructed and engrossing, nonetheless.\n\nRefocusing on Fallout's main tenants of design, I'll very bluntly state that the player progression is atrocious. The leveling system in Fo4 removed skills from its makeup, and now relies solely on the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system and perks. This is a problem, because the level of diversity you can apply to your character is limited to 70 perks (many of which are boring stat-multipliers), where as you used to have over a dozen skills with values of 1-100, which made for incredible variation in player type, as well as more worthwhile perks. To compound this issue, Fo4 almost never provides different solutions to quests and dilemmas [i]based[/i] on the character you've built; making progression pointless in roleplaying terms.\n\nSpeaking of things in Fallout 4 that are pointless, the choices are too. Well, that isn\u2019t entirely true, some quests do have a final decision you can make on how to resolve a situation, but in essence you can't choose to [i]be[/i] anything but a constant quest-sponge. This is partially due to the aforementioned, restrictive progression system, but the actions you can take are so limiting both physically and in conversation, that you can't kill people you don't like because half of all named characters are essential, and you can almost never turn down a quest in dialogue. [i]Player \"choice\" at its finest.[/i] Oh, and as for the damned dialogue...\n\nYet another dumbed-down aspect of Fo4 that was once essential to the series, is the dialogue. The crux of this issue is the limitations the system imposes by always artificially mandating 4 response options, even when more or less may be fitting. This makes conversations feel inhuman, in an uncanny-valley way, which bleeds into both the personalities of the characters and the depth of the quests. Characters (other than SOME companions) are never given the justice they deserve because your interactions with them are so narrow, and quests default to almost always being shoot and loot affairs, because the dialogue is not built for intense, thoughtful debates. Every roleplaying element has proven to be a disappointment, and I\u2019ll expose why.\n\nTake a moment to consider this fact: [b]there is not a single writer credited for the creation of Fallout 4.[/b] The lead designer, Emil Pagliarulo, is the only person whose job description even partially included writing. This illustrates why there is a lack of thought put into the roleplaying, dialogue, choices, and quests; as they require a consistent team of [i]professional[/i] writers to construct and ensure each element works in harmony. That's what's at the heart of Fo4's troubles in my eyes; a complete disrespect towards writing in any form, which is what made Fallout what it is today.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Fallout 4 is a perfectly well designed game on the basis of being just that; a game. What it is decidedly not however, is a Fallout RPG, because to be one of those you have to actually adhere to what made previous Fallout's so great. Those who have not played a Fallout game before will almost certainly enjoy Fo4, but as a long standing fan of the franchise, and as someone whose favorite game series was Fallout, all Fo4 gives me; is heartaches by the number.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 6/10 - Entirely Mediocre[/h1]\n\n(Posted On: 8/13/17)", "timestamp_created": 1448318019, "timestamp_updated": 1529718547, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 147, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.879698395729064941", "comment_count": 37, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34996694": {"recommendationid": "34996694", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034292043", "num_games_owned": 565, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507576027}, "language": "english", "review": "Bethesda 2015 : \"Let modders fix the game\"\nBethesda 2017 : \"Let modders fix the game and we take the money for it\"", "timestamp_created": 1505567698, "timestamp_updated": 1505567953, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2291, "votes_funny": 204, "weighted_vote_score": "0.929100513458251953", "comment_count": 36, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34616931": {"recommendationid": "34616931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047337385", "num_games_owned": 1857, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 2732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491898870}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't support cash-grabbing attempts and sincerely hope they remove it entirely.\n\nApart from the cash-grab attempt that is the Creation Club:\n\nFallout4 did not live up to the hype. While the visuals are certainly an upgrade to its predecessors, almost every other element takes more than a few steps down the ladder. The role-play element that seemed to be the primary focus of 3 and New Vegas is gone, you have almost no impact on the story or events. Multiple paths to the same goal have diminished to \"path 1 kills these guys, path 2 kills those guys. There are no more alternate paths.\"\n\nPart of this degredation to the roleplay element comes in the form of the voiced protaganist; voice lines are expensive and as such you now have a choice between 4 dialog options at all times - no more and no less. Installing the mod to show you the full sentence they speak, rather than a vague descriptor (sarcastic is always an option) you see that more often than not ALL dialog options achieve the same thing. Yes, I'm not sure but I guess so, sarcastic yes, no... but I have to. Branching paths exist only in superficial forms such as which faction you choose to represent. Regardless of which faction you choose, you will be performing the same exact quest and quest goals but for different quest givers in different places. In other words, they're the same. The illusion of choice is a STRONG element in FO4, and they don't do a particularly good job of maintaining the ILLUSION part of it.\n\nCombat is lackluster. Mechanically, the guns work fairly well, but fall flat in other ways. Guns are extremely weak, legendary enemies such as the legendary raider will take dozens of shots to the head to kill. Scaling enemies work the same as they did in Skyrim. Between the levels of 1-12 the raiders are level 9. Meaning at level 12, they're easy but at 1 they're very hard. As soon as you reach level 13 they scale up for the 13-21 bracket. Now they're level 18. This means that in leveling up from 12-13 you made the same enemies signficantly harder! This is a very poor means of scaling and arguably scaling should be removed altogether. Some areas would be impossible at low levels, but you could work your way up to them or stealthily explore them. Eventually you'd be good enough to take on the challenge. But instead, with scaled enemies like this, you can just go anywhere at any time as long as you're at the right point of the bracket.\n\nThe gun selection is deceptively small, almost everything is a variation of the pipegun. Other guns do exist such as the revolver. but they're extremely rare and odds are you'll be using 3 variations of the pipegun for short, medium and long range. All of which are ugly, boring, and nowhere near realistic for their caliber. Not to mention, gun damage should only increase or decrease with a change of caliber; NOT with a change of items like the stock, which should only increase accuracy and recoil.\n\nQuests are almost entirely fetch, 'explore' and 'liberate'. Explore quests are glorified fetch quests that essentially complete themselves once you pass a trigger at the end of a 'dungeon'. Only now, you're not bringing anything back. The quest could have said to kill all enemies in the 'dungeon' but as long as you pass this trigger, the quest is complete. Dead enemies or not. Liberate quests on the other hand do require you to kill all of the enemies, but these are almost exclusively for gaining new settlements.\n\nSettlements are boring, the selection of items is small, creativity can be achieved but the building system is so clunky and ugly you won't be finding amazing creations from anyone who hasn't modded the game. \n\nTL;DR\nThe illusion of choice is so strong you effectively have no choice at all. The story is lackluster and filled with concerns, settlements are ugly and clunky, combat level brackets ruin difficulty, legendary enemies can be impossible and far beyond realistic and weapon selection is deceptively small where almost every gun you see is just a variation of the pipe gun.", "timestamp_created": 1504123043, "timestamp_updated": 1504124088, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 166, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.810588061809539795", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34754991": {"recommendationid": "34754991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195939729", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 21532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1543193907}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Bringing back Paid Mods?

Premium content. Mini DLCs. It doesn't matter which words are used to describe Creation Club, when intention behind it is clear.

And I'm worried that if Creation Club keeps this momentum, it will take away more than it will give.

Modders have been keeping Bethesda's games alive for over a decade, and now they've come up with the idea of premium mods, that are supposed to be higher quality than those on Nexus.

Selling mods. That totally worked out fine on the Xbox and Playstation. It also worked out extremely well on PC when they shoved it in for Skyrim. You know what else went well? How well recieved it was for modders who cashed in. The modders got so much respect and had no problems what so ever.\n\nYou know what especially didn't happen when paid mods were introduced to Skyrim? The \"mod store\" sure as hell didn't get spammed with duplicate mods and random people trying to cash in on other people's work, work that was free prior to paid mods(And which was taken down and transfered as paid mods as soon as paid mods became a thing). You know what else didn't happen? The \"mod store\" also wasn't infested with a bunch of useless waste of time, cash grab, shitty \"mods\" that some twat threw together in five minutes. /sarcasm\n\nSeriously, I'm so fed up of the games industry right now. We've got season passes, \"remasters\" of games that are only a year or two old, a bunch of microtransactions not included in season passes(While being sold and released during the season pass' life), we're also seeing the advent of multiple season passes, not just a single season pass per game but upward of three or more season passes for a single game being refreshed every six fucking months. On top of this? We've got lootboxes. Lootboxes upon lootboxes in literally every single game being released these days which ranges from shitty cosmetics which used to be free and unlockable to full on items to make your weapons better(Like the old days of P2W in F2P MMO's). You know how far they've gone now? Lootboxes, paid boosts and \"legendary\" units/items only obtainable through lootboxes, in single player games. Yes. Single player games now have RNG(Basically gambling) lootbox bullshit in them that give progression boosts. Fuck. This. Shit.\n\nNow, the absolute worst of it is the fact that what was once free is now paid(Which seems to be a very common trend these days in the \u20ac60 \"Triple Ayy\" games industry). This is content that makes Bethesda's games what they should have been on release and adds a bunch of QoL improvements that should have been in the game on release and haven't actually been developed by Bethesda. Bethesda make the worst inventory systems and have done for years now. It's always been up to the community to fix it and make sense of the shitty organisation in inventory across all Bethesda games. Now, with paid mods, you'll be expected to pay \u20ac2-\u20ac5 for a simple inventory QoL fix. Like, wtf?! You can't justify this crap. Let's also not forget the fact that there's no gaurentees that these mods will be supported in the future. So, say you buy a mod. Your game gets updated. Your mod breaks and the modder who created it doesn't update the mod. Tough shit. You're SOL and just wasted your money and, possibly, your hundreds of hours game save that relied on a mod to work. Congrats, you've just paid some random asshole and Bethesda to fuck you in the ass and take away hundreds of hours of gameplay away from you.\n\nAnd then you have the whole shitbrigade defending this crap and saying \"Oh, but these things won't be paid mods!\" but they will. They absolutely will. Give all this shit time and before you know it your favourite inventory mod or travel mod or whatever the hell you like will shift from free to unsupported unless you pay. Then we've got the precedence of what it sets for future titles where this shit is baked into the game and there will be no way to support mods outside of it, as in Bethesda and other companies will lock down these games so they can not be modded without using their service. I don't need to explain just how much of an impact that will have on PC gaming. Just remember the amount of freedom as PC gamers we will lose when files and sections of games are locked behind some Single Player DRM which only purpose is to stop people from installing mods outside of the built in \"service.\"\n\nJust remember that everything that was said five-ten years ago about microtransactions came true. Every. Single. Thing. Now every game has microtranscations. Now every MP game has fucking in-game shops to buy skins, weapons, boosts and whatever the hell else. Now every game has a fucking season pass. Now most -- at least -- have locked DLC or \"microtransactions\" gated on release unless you \"pre-order\" or pay extra for this shit. Just as it was with microtransactions and the warnings we had about that shitfest ten years ago it's going to be the exact same with paid mods. If this shit sails, in two to three years time we're going to see DRM for mods(Which is already a thing from the Skyrim paid mods fiasco btw) in every single mod, the mod scene move from being as open and dynamic to allow people to create what they want and enjoy to a more business orientated system which caters to those who make, basically, FotM content. What will happen then? No more breakouts like Battlegrounds, survival genres, nothing because every single modder and their mother will be trying to cash in on flavour of the month bullshit content with not a single bit of original thought between them.\n\nThis is not good for gaming. This kind of content should never have paywalls blocking entry other than the initial purchase of the base game. If a mod really goes beyond and sets a game aside then it should be up to the developers/publishers of said game to reward the modder, not have others pay for it.\n\nThis is not good.", "timestamp_created": 1504018533, "timestamp_updated": 1504018533, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2382, "votes_funny": 47, "weighted_vote_score": "0.943399786949157715", "comment_count": 87, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34889587": {"recommendationid": "34889587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063434418", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483308966}, "language": "english", "review": "People didn't want paid mods 2 years ago, why would they want them now?", "timestamp_created": 1505160940, "timestamp_updated": 1505160940, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1344, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.904643893241882324", "comment_count": 25, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35122081": {"recommendationid": "35122081", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969797584", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486847111}, "language": "english", "review": "I paid full retail for this game and all the DLC. \n\nNot happy about this recent development in paid mods at all. \n\nI guess I am not alone.\n\nPlease get the message Bethesda.", "timestamp_created": 1506064170, "timestamp_updated": 1506064170, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2328, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.912332773208618164", "comment_count": 37, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35122035": {"recommendationid": "35122035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055055887", "num_games_owned": 993, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 5878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513435349}, "language": "english", "review": "\"They are not going to be paid mods\"- Bethesda", "timestamp_created": 1506063933, "timestamp_updated": 1506063933, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 958, "votes_funny": 91, "weighted_vote_score": "0.89535444974899292", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35121353": {"recommendationid": "35121353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108965777", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509351808}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey bethesda, here's a nice \"fuck you\" \n\nHere, I'll mark it on your map", "timestamp_created": 1506060467, "timestamp_updated": 1506060467, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1045, "votes_funny": 596, "weighted_vote_score": "0.905805349349975586", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34571944": {"recommendationid": "34571944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060139734", "num_games_owned": 515, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 37198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1522923774}, "language": "english", "review": "Fallout 4 is the epitemy of everything wrong with modern gaming, it has a total of 2 compelling quests, its gameplay is worse then the rest, and to top it off they added microtransactions to it. it is the worst of the fallout series.", "timestamp_created": 1503995997, "timestamp_updated": 1527017520, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3831, "votes_funny": 59, "weighted_vote_score": "0.908268332481384277", "comment_count": 92, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32860698": {"recommendationid": "32860698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297564639", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 22962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1542173305}, "language": "english", "review": "I shall start by saying that if you are deciding to buy this game then don't let the negative reviews sway you.

It has an exceptional amount of content, and the early sense of exploring the wasteland is thrilling . Unfortunately, it turns out to be a massive letdown. Here are five reasons why.\n\u00a0\n1) The engine is not up to the task. Its handling of shadows is infamous. On a GTX1080 it suffers significant framerate drops, even with settings turned down. It is also plagued with glitches, such as characters sinking into the floor or the player getting stuck.\n\u00a0\n2) The UI is poor. Endlessly scrolling through the Misc section of your inventory to find the latest note or disc which you picked up is infuriating. The lack of any sort of indication of the locations of your companions is a glaring omission, especially given how prone they are to lag behind or disappear altogether (I had to use console commands to retrieve Dogmeat at one point).\n\u00a0\n3) It\u2019s not a good RPG. You are rarely given compelling choices, and most of those are crude binary options. Skillchecks are limited to dialogue, based on RNG and are easily maxed out regardless of your character build due to the levelling system. I never felt like I was playing *my* character. I completed Fallout 2 six times just to try different character builds and choices. Once is enough for this game.\n\u00a0\n4) The writing is bland and forgettable for the most part. It doesn\u2019t help that I came to this after Shadowrun: Hong Kong \u2013 a game with a compelling storyline and deep characters. Nothing about this game made me care about the people, factions or places it depicts. It was hard to choose between factions not because each had strong merits, but because I disliked them all. As the story funnelled me into wiping out person after person, I realised that I didn't care about the named characters any more than the countless faceless enemies who I'd wiped out in the wasteland. It all felt so meaningless.\n\u00a0\n5) It\u2019s packed full of busywork. Settlement building is utterly pointless and inconsequential; it doesn\u2019t matter if my settlers have no food or beds.

Being able to enhance the game through the modding system is very nice as well and gives you more hours of play as you find new things to try. I have spent hours buidling and actually restarted the game now 4 or 5 times trying out different things. I do use quite a few mods and I'm sure the contributes to the CTD's etc in the game.

The game is a massive overhaul of the former 3D Fallout titles. All actual thinking is removed from the game and now perks mean nothing. Get your overpowered suit of armor 10 minutes in, kill your first deathclaw 12 minutes in. I can't help but ask what is going on in Todd Howard's head. The game revolves around a 3 phase core; \n[list]\n[*]step 1: go to a location; \n[*]step 2: kill everything at said location/complete a shitty quest; \n[*]step 3: loot everything you can and move on to the next place.\n[/list] All the \"RPG\" elements of Fallout are stripped away from the game in favor of a more [i]accurate[/i] representation of combat. \n\n[h1]the graphics[/h1] The art style is okay I guess. Some of the locations look bland and boring and quite frankly I prefer the locations from 3 or New Vegas over these. The color choice is honestly quite sketchy at best and at worse just plain boring. It's akin to going outside and looking at dirt, then turning around and looking at a pile of rocks, then turning and looking at a pile of bricks, then turning and looking at a pile of dog shit. I understand its supposed to be gritty, but couldn't they have made some scenic areas? Something like adding some still functioning neon signs or maybe an area where the vegetation started to regrow? Regardless at its core the game is overall pretty bland on the color choice. Some of the textures look quite hideous for the amount of time and the hardware of todays standards. They don't necessarily detract from the gameplay experience, but when you notice them they do detract from the overall immersion. \n\n[h1]the story[/h1] Okay, lets talk about the story. [spoiler]A nuke crashes into the Boston area and your son gets kidnapped from you at the vault you take shelter in.[/spoiler] Not a bad premise for the story, but not an original one either[spoiler]and by that I mean the kidanpping part[/spoiler]. It's better than being a prisoner who becomes a savior by far, but nothing new on this front. The only problems I have with the story is that it isn't very memorable nor does it have any reprecussions for you ignoring it. You can spend 2000 hours not giving a single fuck about your [spoiler]kidnapped son[/spoiler] and nothing happens. No synth takeover, nothing. It would have been interesting to have a time limit of sorts to [spoiler]save your son[/spoiler] and if you dont get to [spoiler]him[/spoiler] in time then a massive synth incorporation into the society happens. Why this was never thought of or put into the game I'll never know. \n\n[h1]the sound[/h1] Overall the sound design is pretty good. I like the atmosperic sounds of the world and it made me feel more engaged in it. Even the creatures of the world had very wonderful and creepy sounds, I loved it. The guns on the otherhand sounded like... well kinda weak. When I fire a gun in my neck of the woods it makes a loud [b]boom[/b], but when I shoot in Fallout 4 it just feels like I'm playing with an [strike]airsoft gun[/strike] a spring gun. It's unsatisying to hear all these amazing overworld sounds and creature sounds and then when you go to shoot it just feels... meh. In this aspect it makes me feel more obligated to playing a melee character which is really fun. Speaking of which \n\n[h1]the gameplay[/h1] The combat in the game feels pretty solid, especially the melee parts. Every hit makes nice impact [spoiler]not really damage-wise but thats what I get for maxing out the difficulty[/spoiler] and its overall an enjoyable experience. The gunplay is very solid too, every shot I can tell exactly where it's going to hit and shooting things is quite a nice experience. The VATS system used in this game is pretty cool, I like how instead of stopping time like some sort of DIO-esque character you instead slow time to slightly faster than a crawl but slower than a second. The killcams also look quite good and allow for some pretty gruesome screenshots. If you want to get this game the best factor of it is the combat hands down. It's not perfect but it's the best its ever been in a Fallout game. The exploration isn't as rewarding as they make it out to be and the randomly generated loot just makes the grind even more of a grind. Adhesive is going to kill your mid to late game if you don't stockpile it as soon as you get started. \n\n\n[h1]the crafting[/h1] I like the idea of crafting upgrades for your weapons and adding say extra damage or extra firing rate give the already lackluster weapons some actual viability on harder difficulties. Of course punching things is the only good meta in the game though and using a suit of power armor just makes the game a cakewalk. I could easily sneak through any area with a power armor and my fists and kill literally anything that moved, breathed, or had a pulse. Giving something that fundamentally broken so early on is a fool hardy move and also given that the combat even on the hardest difficulties is nothing short of piss easy it makes the fanbase move on to getting mods that increase the difficulty or change the start of the game or the \"perk\" system. \n\n[h1]the \"perks\"[/h1] Alright so let's move on to the meat and potatoes. These aren't perks at all, they're minor passive buffs to stats with specific weapons or with your ability to not eat dogass at picking a lock. The only perk in the entire tree worth getting is Blitz. In fact, its so useful it helped me break through walls and almost broke a quest for me [spoiler]it did however break the castle quest and now I can never complete it[/spoiler]. \n\n[h1]my TL;DR[/h1] The game at its core is flawed and a mess, however that isn't to say the game is awful. It's an average game full of below average qualities with an above average combat system and a superb sound design. If they would have tried to make the game more like an ACTUAL fallout game (y'know like with choices and stuff) then I think it would have been a far better title. Gutting the perk system and replacing it with this bastardized shell ruins the RPG element and basically put it on par with a Call of Duty clone or an MMO but singleplayer only [spoiler]commentary on how ESO is literally singleplayer the multiplayer experience, but not[/spoiler]. The foundation is there but they forgot to put up the walls. And fill in the floors. And put in plumbing. And put in a powergrid. The game falls short on so many levels to its predecesor that honestly I wouldn't even recommend it at all unless you really want to play it for the combat.
