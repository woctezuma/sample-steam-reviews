Unlike another game I played over the weekend (09/03/16) there were actually people on this game. But there's not very many people playing this game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=757644964\n\n[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]\n[b]Story:[/b] The story is Gordan Freeman has gone batsh*t crazy and fighting against himself. Apparently once upon a time you could change skins, and there was a community for this game. But just like walking through a ghost town, all you see are the houses where people used to live. There are still PLENTY of servers to join, but no one to play with. It's always kinda sad to see this happen to a game.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] As far as I can tell, Half-Life Deathmatch: Source uses the same weapons as Half-Life. Just like Half-Life 2: Deathmatch uses pretty much the same weapons and features of Half-Life 2. The only difference is that as of now there are still people playing Half-Life 2: Deathmatch.\n\nFor those that like handholding and my sarcastic descriptions, here are the weapons you get: The almighty Crowbar, whom I informed everyone that I was a master of crowbar-fu. A pistol, which I had the accuracy of a stormtrooper... was it lag? or am I bad? The world will never know. You've got your revolver, which Chuck Norris can slam a revolving door [i](yeah, I stretched for that one.)[/i], your various assortment of SMG, shotguns, railguns, crossbow, laser tracking rocket of death, grenades, trip mines, alien gun, mining laser, and death-by-blue-vortex.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=757644974\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] I feel like it's weird to see Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is priced at $9.99, while Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is priced at $4.99... I guess it's that extra 5 dollars for the retro-status. *sigh*\nThis game is probably a pass, I could go either way on the recommendation status of this review. Based on what I played the game does what it's supposed too, there were a few people to play against, it wasn't a bad FPS death match game ... back in it's day it was quite the popular game, chances are you'll pick up this game in a half-life bundle, and truthfully you'll have more fun just playing Half-Life offline.\nBut, that's my thoughts on it, thank you for taking the time to read this review!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=757644986", "timestamp_created": 1473210116, "timestamp_updated": 1473210134, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605825364589691162", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18151943": {"recommendationid": "18151943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101854126", "num_games_owned": 512, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442960129}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Half-Life Deathmatch: Source [/h1]\n\nThis deathmatch game is really great, lots of maps and weapons that make my nostalgia go crazy!\nbut the game is dead...

This port makes the game run on the newer engine that is simply just called Source. Unfortunately better engine doesn't always mean better game.\n\nHalf-Life Deathmatch: Source does everything you would expect. Better sound quality, better poerformance on newer computers and simply just faster to boot up. Unfortunately Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is a lazy port and doesn't really deserve to be played.\n\nIf you want a better experience on the Half-Life multiplayer I would suggest for you to pick up the original [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/70/HalfLife/]Half-Life[/url] for better experience. Sure, the engine might be clunky and outdated but trust me, you'll have better time playing it over this mess.\n\nWhat is so different about Half-Life Deathmatch: Source compared to the original Half-Life multiplayer? Everything. Half-Life Deathmatch: Source feels nothing like the original. You get stuck on things; the movement feels extremely awkward. And that's the biggest problem. Even though the newer engine handles physics better than the old one it still manages to screw up the mechanics of the old multiplayer. Then comes the random crashes. And last but not least, oh no no this one right here is a huge problem, are that everyone in the game are bullet sponges. Sometimes it takes an eternity to kill just one enemy. Unless of course you've hoarded each and every exlposive weapon on the map. Then the multiplayer just becomes a domination spree for you.\n\nSo I don't know... How could I conclude this?
