These are robots, that I had to grind for hours, to get the parts I needed to make them; the reason i actually played robocraft has been flushed down the toilet.\n\nWhat on earth have you done FreeJam? What is the point in robocraft now? Did you listen to the wrong end of the player spectrum? What is the point in weapons that are so stupidly nurfed? This was a great game, and I hate being the type of person say this, but you absolutely wreaked robocraft. If this is the direction you want to take robocraft then its a very sad day.

tiers of armour and everything made sense. The game would force you to be strategic with how you made your bot and how you would need to protect your pilot. There used to be none of this crappy one leg one gun trash. I absolutely loved the original game. Way back you could build almost any kind of design and make it work, now you either have to copy some brokenly overpowered design that you can't seem to put a dent in. Double shotgun hovers, plasma copters, tesseracts. all the creativity in this game is gone. \nNow I shall talk about the more recent updates When they added tiers back to the game, I was kinda excited. Then I was disappointed, the tiers are practically meaningless. it requires actual effort to not be in tier five. the games I played were repetitive and got boring really quick. nobody on the game knows how to communicate or how to actually play the game. The thought pattern of most players is \"is that robot? I must kill\", this often results in players not capping and wasting time. the Catch-up mechanic is completely broken too. I have had many occasions where the crystal to allow you to catch up has spawned with a 5% difference and never spawned when there was a 50% gap. The games recent changes also show that Freejam has no care at all for the experience of players and are just looking to hopefully turn a profit before this mess of a game finally crashes into the burning mess we all saw coming when they ruined the core feel of the original game. They have stolen the \"Season pass\" from Fortnite to attract the eyes of anyone new to this game and grab their money before they realise that the entire game is an unenjoyable experience. They have also attempted to copy the feel of games like Overwatch with certain design aspects and the \"Best player\" cards at the end of a match.\nOkay enough rambling, as I said before, this game used to be amazing, Reaching a new tier was one of the greatest feeling in the world as it unlocked better weapons and everything scaled with you as you got better and better learning how to make greater quality robots. Effort was actually required in order to get to higher tiers. there used to be an actual punishment to death. Now the game just wants your money.", "timestamp_created": 1549116540, "timestamp_updated": 1549116540, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 200, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.915530622005462646", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36201380": {"recommendationid": "36201380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038716051", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 143568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 431, "last_played": 1551652823}, "language": "english", "review": "As you can see by my time with this game I have plenty of experience with it and have been playing for years now.\nI have to say what was once an amazing game has now been turned into an aggravating, annoying, shell of what it once was. What could have been a groundbreaking game is now just bland and uninteresting due to the lack of effort by Freejam.\nMany questionable decisions by freejam has turned this once amazing game into tedious grind with no payoff. \n\nThe CRF:\nWhen I first started playing the only weapon was the smg. I have seen every major update and change come and go. The first and most prominent thing wrong with this game is the CRF, or the Robot shop.  Before the shop was added, every player had to build their own bot. For better or worse. Thats why the tagline for this game is \"Build Drive Fight\" with build being first. Since the start of this game it wasnt just about how well you did in battle but how well you built your bot. They went hand in hand. Those who took the time and effort to build a good bot, were rewarded by doing well in the battles. Now that they have the CRF players can buy any OP bot of the moment and never have to build a thing. Essentially doing away with half of the game and arguably the most interesting aspect of it.\n\nTiers/Progression:\nThere use to be a tier system in this game that allowed for small bots to face off against small bots and large bots against large bots. It also helped add progression to the game along with the tech tree which also has been removed. Now without a tier system all bots fight against each other. Small vs large. So if you feel like taking out a small bot that you know is not the best in battle just for fun or to try out a new design..well..too bad. Now every match is the same. There is no mood to matches. Sometimes I would want to play in a high end bot where people were more competitive. Sometimes I just wanted to play for fun in the lower tiers. All that is gone. Now its just fight...win/lose...fight again. Alot of the time against the same people because of the dwindling population. Plus the tech tree system gave you a goal to aim for. When first starting out you didnt have access to every movement type or weapon. You had to level up and unlock things. Which gave a reason for having levels in the first place. Now all that is gone. Progression is gone. Levels mean nothing, which is why the level cap is so insanely high...because its meaningless. (10,000 lvl cap. Just as an idea of how high that is...my main account hasnt even reached 500)\n\nSpecialties:\nWhen i first started to play this game each bot was a specialist. By this I mean each bot was only able to use one weapon at a time. Be it smg/laser...Nano's...Plasma..etc. This gave every bot a purpose. Smgs were your fighter bots, plasmas were your bombers, nanos were your medics, etc. Each person had a role to play and could choose to fill that roll. Now all that is gone. Each bot can have whatever weapons you want. So they no longer specialize and they no longer require decent team play. Its all just a fight for top score as if that has any meaning to anything.\n\nHealing/autoheal:\nHealing, aka, Nano's have undergone an insane amount of changes. There was a time where a healer or medic was exactly that. They were almost required as there was no built in healing system like there is now. Now people charge in to fight and as soon as they start taking damage they run away and heal up. Where before without an autoheal system, players had to be cautious and value their lives instead of just charging in. Which of course made the medic all the more useful. Now a medic isnt even needed, or bots can just have a nano as just a way to rack up points when not fighting. Also again hurting teamwork. Also there was a time when nano's actually were the weapons they are called. Because each bot could only have one so called weapon, if you chose to be a medic you also had to have a way to defend yourself in a worse case scenario. So nano's use to deal damage, although not much. That also is gone. So pure medics are almost nonexistent. \n\nBugs/features:\nFreejam is absolutely horrible about both bugs and needed features. They always havebeen. There use to be a bug with tanks colliding with the ground. When it happened people would get stuck or go flying into the air...all sorts of odd things. After this was reported it took Freejam over a year to get around to fixing it. Because Freejam are much more concerned with pushing out a new weapon or shiny new item to distract people from the buggy mess that the game is. When it comes to features, the player base is pretty much ignored. The players since early on in development have asked for things like being able to rotate our bots when building, which is still not added to the game and FJ has no intention of adding. They have asked for the ability to reconnect to a match when they get disconnected. That only now is being worked on. Basically Freejam does what it wants when they feel like it, not what the people want.\n\nNow I could be here all day ripping the game apart piece by piece but this is already getting longer than I expected it to.\nBut dont get me wrong its not all bad. Freejam did do things I actually agree with. Getting rid of tiered blocks was a great idea. No more bots with ugly multicolored blocks based on tier. Now you can paint them the way you like. That was great. They got rid of the pilot seat, later bringing it back as a decorative item, which meant that you no longer needed a large bubble in your bot to hide/protect the pilot. Having to build/design your bot around that bubble. It also stopped bots from blowing up in a single hit because the pilot had been taken out.\nOverall it can be a fun game for a short time for somebody new, but you wont last long. The main people still playing are long time fans who still play because they loved what it once was and are now too hooked to quit. (That is till D.R.O.N.E. comes out) \nI'll break it down to a scoring system for you.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nSound: 7/10\nNetcode/connection: 6/10\nGameplay: 5/10\nReplayabililty: 5/10\n\nOverall: 6/10\nFor new people: Ok game for now till something better comes along.\nFor Old people: \"I wish something better would come along\" and/or \"I wish there was an old robocraft server\"\nDo I recommend it....\nNo. Freejam doesnt deserve it for what they have done to the game and not listening to the community.\nSorry this was so long, but if you made it thru and this helped in any way, please give this a thumbs up.\nThank you.", "timestamp_created": 1509567895, "timestamp_updated": 1509634482, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 663, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.955286860466003418", "comment_count": 41, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22826866": {"recommendationid": "22826866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042355428", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 82141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483310658}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b]TL;DR:[/b] Robocraft did not deliver on the potential it promised and instead changed the core gameplay mechanics to mimic other shooters, destroying what made the game unique.[/h1]\n\nI have played this game for over 3000 hours (the standalone launcher does not add to steam hours) and supported the game with over 100GBP (150$+). I was a moderator for the game because I believed in it and wanted to support the community, but was removed from the team because I spoke out to a developer about the direction they were taking \u2013 not because I wasn't doing my job, but because I spoke my mind. \n\nThe game has changed. Freejam have tried to make the game more accessible to new players, with a focus of getting as many players as possible. But instead of focussing on what made the game great and trying to get players to love it, they changed the gameplay mechanics in order to please a wider audience, which destroyed many aspects of what made the game great and unique in the first place.\n\nInstead of a currency reward system that allows players to buy the parts they want for their robots, they now have a \"random loot crate\" reward system, which is a blatant attempt at copying other games and trying to trick people into spending real money on the game. Non-premium users get tempted by the items that they could have received if they had paid for premium (every loot crate that gets opened show the premium items) with the option to purchase it now to receive the items. Furthermore, only the top scoring player on the winning team receives the highest level crate (which promises better item drop chances), while every member of the losing team receives the same low quality crate. This leads to selfish play for the highest score rather than the rewarding teamplay experience that it used to be, and also leads to the losing team to stop trying because they receive the same bad rewards either way.\n\nThey also made the most interesting part about the game \u2013 the fact that building skill and design decisions directly affects battle performance \u2013 much less meaningful over the last couple of months, by removing the pilot seat component, introducing auto-healing (another aspect to mimic other shooters), and allowing each player to put several different gun types on their robots, which removes the need for playstyle specialisations. This also negatively affects teamplay, because there is no use for dedicated medics or dedicated frontline or support types \u2013 every player is now a (selfish) one-man-army trying to score the highest points.\n\nThis game had a lot of potential a year ago, but the developer's decisions over the last updates have shown that they care less about making a good game and more about the money they can make by trying to get more players with lower skill levels, by copying other generic shooter-types and removing/reducing the unique aspects that used to make Robocraft great.\n\nFreejam have gone the way many F2P games go and opted for the cash-grab alternative.

It had everything you could ask for: balancing, a good community, active and attentive devs, weapons that complemented each other, fun gameplay, good progression, lack of \"pay2win\" and so forth. Needless to say, it was awesome.\n\nThen the January 2015 update was released.\n\nThe January 2015 update added a new gamemode where you destroy towers, levelled up, and respawn if destroyed. Initially, me and the rest of the community thought \"Cool.\" and waited to see what else was in store. Little did I know that the downfall of Robocraft had begun.\n\n(Order not completely accurate)\n\n\"Megabots\" (gigantic robots basically) were removed as soon as the update came out, if not before.\n\nCrates were introduced (partially replacing the robits system), level based CPU limits eliminated, and the tech tree removed, eliminating progression, reducing creativity, and generally made the game much worse. Despite the huge outcry and the veterans and other players who started to leave the game, the devs simply ignored the community and moved on.\n\nHelicopter blades were added, enabling people to make flying fortresses (maybe literrally). Personally I don't think much of this.\n\nThen weapons, most notably an anti-air cannon and a minigun, were added, making weapons unbalanced and the game more frustrating to play. As a pilot in Robocraft (a more \"traditional\" one who used plasma bombers), this particulary saddened and angered me.\n\nA robot shop was added, further reducing creativity.\n\nAn intro was added into the game, giving the game a more \"cheezy\" feel and making it seem as if the developers were copying other games. By this point, I personally felt that the developers were catering more toward children (12 year olds) and no longer valued older players and veterans.\n\nAll this time, veterans and other older players were leaving the game as it became increasingly apparent that the developers were not listening to the community. \n\nA new chat system was added, featuring a clan system that the community had been asking for for a long time. This was not nearly enough however, as the other changes above (as well as others) and the careless developers made the game unenjoyable for me (and potentially other older players, although I can not speak for them on this matter).\n\nI finally left Robocraft for good in mid 2015 (shortly after the new chat system was introduced) after a brief stint operating a hovercraft with SMGs.\n\nIn it's current state, Robocraft is unbalanced and unenjoyable. The developers are careless and possibly largely inactive (aside from bugfixes and tweaks). Gameplay is frustrating, gamemodes horrible. \n\nAs another reviewer (spynathan) has said: \"From Robocraft to Robocrap.\"\n\nIf, somehow, all (and I mean all) changes to the game were reverted back to sometime before the January 2015 update, say, November 2014, me and other members of the community (read their reviews to see what they have to say) who have left Robocraft may very well return.\n\nUntil then, goodbye Robocraft.\n\nP.S.

In 2015 or so the game was really good until Freejam completely destroyed it and ruined it. (Something you will notice is that Freejam is completely incompentent and has absolutely no idea what it's doing). Yesterday I and a few friends decided we should try it again to see how it is, and we were all pleasently suprised -- It was actually fun, and not nearly as bad as it used to be!\n\nHowever, I can not recommend this game. The developers have no idea what balance is. They implemented a weapon that completely ruins aircraft and makes them almost unplayable. As someone who as always been a flyer main, this is extremely frustrating. I put a lot of time into designing the perfect craft that is lightweight, fast, and good at taking down other aircraft. All this time is put to waste because of 1 person at the back of the map with lock on missile launchers that you can't dodge, there are no flares, they turn towards you literally instantly mid air and circle around you so that once they have fired there is no chance of survival and they fly toward you and instantly kill you. I mean, I'm sorry I wanted to play as an actual plane that actually flies and not some hovercraft stuck near the ground, but I guess fun isn't allowed. \n\nYou will encounter 1 almost every single game. It is impossible to enjoy flying aircraft while these disgusting pieces of imbalanced mess are on at least 1 robot every battle. Aircraft are not meant to fly in canyons and valleys. Their entire purpose is to fly high and bomb things from above, and to kill enemy bombers. Throughout Robocrafts entire history, ever since they slit the games throat in 2015, the game has been plagued by horrible balance issues that had 1 stupidly overpowered weapon that smites down anyone who dares to try to have fun in Robocraft.\n\nBalance aside, the game is still bad. As a FTP player you have only 4 paints, as a PTP player you have only 20 or so. Modern monitors can display over 16 million colors (The human eye can't even see that many), so why are we so limited? It would be so easy to just add a color wheel! Wait times are very long, and the render distance is tiny. You can only see other bots from maybe 500 feet away. There is also a sad map selection, with maybe only 10.\n\nThe new \"\"\"\"progression\"\"\"\" system is complete garbage. Previously you had a tech tree and would slowly work your way up, and would only fight people with access to the same levels of tech. You could also only have 1 type of weapon on a craft at a time. Now, progression is tied to loot boxes. After a battle, you get a loot box, you open it, and then you're allowed to buy a new type of item. It's as bad as it sounds.\n\nAlso, you can now have up to 5 different types of weapons. This leads to overpowered \"anti everything\" craft. And of course, there is no reason to be creative and build something nice. You will just be killed by death cubes. With the removal of the tech system, the way of tech scaling was also lost. Now, as a new player, you will be placed against people who have had this since day 1 and have all the best gear and the most overpowered death cube of them all.\n\nEdit: Yes I realize that freejam is \"fixing\" the game and bringing it back to \"the good old days,\" but I really don't care. Stop telling me. Why should I come back again and spend even more time than I already have for the promise that one day it might be good? This is not even a solution to the problem, and only makes it worse and further points to the larger issue. FreeJam is incompetent. They have absolutely no idea what they are doing, and that is that. Frankly, it is worse that are bringing back the old tier system. FreeJam is fickle, and it refuses to make up its mind and get its act together. They keep changing the game, they do this constantly and they always have. \n\nIf you like the game as it is at any given time you can be almost sure that the game you loved will be completely different next month. If you enjoy this game and want to give FreeJam yet another chance of redemption, then great. Good for you. I am not you, and I can't make you do anything. However, I will not and can not support, respect, and forgive FreeJam. Do not pretend like this is going to be the rebirth of Robocraft, and that everything will be perfect.

It was a really fun game that had nearly limitless building. I was here before you guys were on Steam and have many more hours than recorded. You could kick the crap out of anything if you built a bot really well. There was no skillcap to how well you could build a bot and the pilot seat was an amazing mechanic. I would build wheeled railgun tanks with tons of thrusters and a gun frame that was seperate from the armor, and it would literally climb 80 degree walls and I could shoot off cliffs at players, this was before aerial vehicles. I could lose the whole front end and I would still have a gun frame with guns in the front, and I could grind out these resources while having fun in a couple of days, without shelling out ANY money. I could build an insane megabot that I could then destroy players with without spending money if I played average and didn't get upset at dumb plays. I could face a bot that is really good at killing mine. You game was great, anybody could do what I could without spending lots of money if they were decent players. Then came the crazy overhauls, No more pilot seats, lock ons, no limit to parts based on level, loss of tiers. Your game only lives because of the impressionable children that can afford to shell out money just to make some progress and the youtubers you pay to promote your content.

Robocraft was such a nice game back then! I remember... we had the Tier-Classes which were really important for a fair match! (Today you get thrown into a match, flooded by \"pro's\" which one -or two shot you with the ion distorter or any legendary weapon, which practically isn't affordable if you don't want to spend 100 bucks for these shitty protonium crates.)\n\n2. Adding those \"crates\" was the worst idea ever. We all know that games with these \"crates concepts\" died shortly after release. Should i tell you why? Because there will be a lack of fun! Back then I wanted a strong weapon. What I did was farming RP because I had the motivation to get this weapon! After like 10 - 20 matches I had enough to buy this weapon. It felt rewarding because you knew that you worked for it. Today you get a gold/diamond crate (..meh..), with maybe 1 or 2 rares which in my opinion belong into a dustbin. Beside this \"rare\" catch you get f*cking blocks and without premium chances are pretty good that you won't get the good shit for years!\n\n3. What happened to the Tech-Tree? It was abandoned. The Tech-Tree gave you freedom to unlock whatever you thought was useful for your bot. Whenever you saw something interesting you worked for it and also had fun! By removing the Tech-Tree and RP Robocraft lost its foundation.\n\n4. The \"repair-feature\" during a match made \"Nano-Bots\" worthless.\n\n5.  The weapons were nerfed way too much. Remember the rail gun? It was strong as f*ck, but it had to reload several seconds to unleash a strong shot. Also the chance to miss was pretty high and on close quarters you had to run away, because you couldn't do nothing but miss! - In my opinion this was balanced! Also the drivers seat was removed. Why? You had the urge to protect you driver, because you knew if he wasn't secured to 1 Block you would've been insta-killed. In my opinion this feature added tactics, because you had to figure out where the weak point of the enemy robot was.\n\n6. Now to a new feature: Recycling! Prices are way tooooo low. You just get 25% worth of that item and we all know you just get crap outta those crates. So to buy an other item which won't appear in a crate you got to farm.... how long? 1, 2, 3 hours like in the past? Heeell no! It takes forever just for an item!\n\n7. Now to the Forge: Prices are too high! How the f*ck are you able to forge a moderate item when the recycling just yields 25% worth of that item?\n\n8.  Back then you had to buy cosmetics, garage space, and other non-game-breaking equipment with real money. The garage space was limited, pretty fair tho?\n\n9. I like the idea of the Factory, but there are several problems. People don't got Robits because the crates just yield crap and the prices are too high. So how do they buy robots? They don't. And this is the reason why the Factory is senselessly!\n\n10. The company of course needs money, because they also have families to feed. But this (in the past) glorious game was ruined  because of greed! It wasn't a smart move to change the game concept from \"FreeAndFunToPlay\" to a \"PayToHaveFunOrFarmYourselfDead\" concept. The company will see that if they  hadn't been so greedy they would have earned more money....\n\nRest in Peace Robocraft.

I'm not going to be rude or to be nostalgic, I'm only going to state actual [b]facts[/b] that justify this negative review.\n\nAs of today, what do we have now? A game that vaguely ressembles something in which we assemble parts to create a [i]robot[/i] that we bring in battle to fight with team mates and against opponents. [i]Vaguely ressembles[/i] because the reality is a game that terribly lacks anything properly thought like gameplay, balance, progression, sense of achievement, fairness, social network (and communication means), and so on and so forth. The result is a \"game\" in which parts are more and more numerous, yet the diversity during battles is poorer and poorer. The remaining players are more and more selfish, aggressive, unfriendly, unfair, rude and behave in an hateworthy way. The robots are more and more ugly, unbalanced, while a majority of theorical designs and combinations are absolutely useless.\n\nThe result for you, as a potential future player? You trying to build something nice, struggling to do it (because hours and hours and HOURS of grinding), yet you end up being obliterated in combat by atrocities that took 5 minutes to build, because hey they just have the best parts and [i]you have garbage[/i] that cannot possibly do anything good. That is, if you haven't spent an enormous amount of ingame currency in an item that is labbeled as extremely rare, yet it is terrible. And of course you keep being steam rolled by players who already have much better equipment than you, yet this equipment is \"combat rated\" the same level than yours.\n\nWhat? You won a battle and you've certainly been the best player of your team? Congratulations, you haven't earned anything more than the other players of your team. You've been carrying over several players who could even have obtained better stuff than you. That is, IF you have a better score than them, because now the score doesn't reflect how useful to your team you have been and rewards only those who have kept stealing kills or who kept shooting crystals while leaving all the dirty job to you. Whatever, you cannot possibly be rewarded for being good and doing what needs to be done for the sake of victory, actually you'll always be punished for that.\n\nThe only thing that rewards is being lame, having a nooby behavior, being selfish, working [u]against your team mates[/u] and abusing the features/parts that are perfectly legit, yet extremely unbalanced (or by comparison that do work while the rest is utter buggy garbage). No wonder why the remaining players are so hateworthy.\n\nSo now, do you have any feedback to give, or any proposals? Forget it: as much as the devs claim that they listen to the players, they don't. The only thing they will do, is being gadly praised by na\u00efve players who barely have any experience in the game at all, or by kissasses whose goal is to be noticed by \"dev senpai\" (maybe expecting a moderator position in the process, not for the good reasons, obviously).\n\nThe development team seems to be completely oblivious to concepts like product/project management and design. They do and undo things. They plan and unplan. They throw up ideas and hype the playerbase about them, yet they do nothing about them, or at best they half-do them. If something ever gets done, nothing ensures that it will remain anyway: it can very well be removed, for bad reasons. They don't finish anything correctly and neatly, they don't test thoroughly. They don't know what their priorities should be. When looking for an increase of the player retention, they jump to solutions and tools which they don't master at all (or even understand anything about), instead of doing the obvious thing: listening to their players and understand what goes wrong. To have an objective analysis of their game, they favor the opinion of random kids who barely touched the game 10 minutes, instead of asking their experienced players (some of which who also have experience in game/product design or marketting) who are looking for the best for everyone and setting aside their personal needs.\n\nTo make it short: they do nothing the right way, favor those who praise them for bad reasons (or who find all the excuses possible in the world for everything that goes wrong) and are extremely disrespectful/neglecting toward those who are truly trying to help them and who will praise them with sincerity if something was done well. If not outright rude and insulting toward the last ones. If anything, the way they work is exactly similar to that of teenagers: no objectives, no methods, no backup/documenting, no tracing, no measurement (to check if the objectives have been met), no feedback analysis, no measurement of. They just do things randomly, basing themselves on their whims, and expect that somehow [i]this will do[/i].\n\nI won't expand on this or that feature, people have already done so before me. I will however point out something crucial that the CEO himself is completely oblivious about: you cannot state that the \"player retention\" is maintained when you implement a feature that explicitely forces your players to login everyday to get a random reward.\n\nSo that's it. All the experienced, fair, creative, sincere/honest and nice people who used to play this game are now gone and have abandoned every hope of seeing the game back up. Now, all you have left to play with are a bunch of horrible kids whose only goal is to thrash you as much as they can with the most disgusting and unfair robot/methods ever possible, an who will kissass the devs. No friendship, no humour, no joy, no laughs, no creativity, [b][i]NO FUN[/i][/b]. Even the features themselves are more and more anti-fun and promote selfishness and unfairness instead of teamwork, skill and friendship.\n\nPlease FreeJam, don't take this review personally, but you've screwed up and keep doing so.

Got gradually better and better. Then went into debt and became a pay to win trash. Paying for better items over other people should not determine a good game. \n\nOn yet another note with the horrid game my friend who also happenend to play the game was recently trying to join the game once again as mega bots were reintroduced!\n\nSadly to find his account suspened again. He hasn't played the fucking game in OVER A FEW MONTHS! His account was suspened once by a bad dev who was removed for banning people for insulting him becuase he is a horrible fucking dev and person to begin with. The game has a profanity filter you can turn on and off. The fact that you a player can determine whether you want to see that or not should not allow you to be punish for said swearing. \n\nI helped him the first time he was suspened and got his account fixed. However after a few weeks he grew bored as I did and we stopped playing it. Some how he was magically rebanned. Asking a Dev for some explaination as to why he had been banned the dev simply made a remark on his previous supsension which was only one seeing as they have a 3 strike system in place. The guy them proceeded to tell him if he wishes to continue playing the game to MAKE A NEW ACCOUNT. Seriously fuck this game and these people.\nOn another note, building in the game is a free platform for creative construction. If an indivdual wishes to build a giant cock that flies and shoots lazer then so fucking be it. The face that they gave the freedom for someone to contruct whatever they want means an individual should be alloud to do so in the first place. To tell them they arn't alloud to build what they want is fucking moronic. If they do no wish for said things to be built they should disallow it in the first place with some sort of system that detects it. Personally I feel there should be no limit to ones imagination. Limiting people is the reason why this game is slowly fucking withering away. \n\nThey are trying everything they can now that the game is dying at an incredibly fast rate. Re-adding megabots, trying to give some currency for playing matches. Making crates easier to obtain. All invain of course seeing as they have already lost the majority of there players. The crate system didn't help and forcing people to progress at an incredibly slower pace than ever before.\nAlso on that note there is no balance or moderation with the bots anymore in matches. This is also leading to why the game is getting no high amount of new players. Anyone who joins will be thrown into a match with people who have far greater and more massively powerful bots then they have. They get destroyed in an instant and with only one or two games they see no fun in just joining and dying over and over again. Instead of obtaining new players and having them stay and want there friends to join boosting the player base, they are instead leaving the game and telling others around them that it's not worth the time it's just another pay to win game that requires grinding to no end. \n\nReally sad to see how this game has just fallen apart. Introduced to me by Jerma and Ster, I thought the game was fantastic and I couldn't stop playing it, every update was fantastic and packed with new content and changes to fix the game and older broken things. Now well it explains itself for new and old players alike. \n\nIf any of the Dev's read this, stop this nonsence with banning people for calling you names or buiding a dick. It's a joke not cancer understand the difference.\n\nas of 6/27/2018 this is an update to point out how yet again freejam has ignored players and just straight up lied to them. Logged onto my account to see how the new update of finally removing these stupid crates was going. As per usual they made plasma bombers op as all hell and made healing stupidly to strong to the point where I couldn't kill a single enemy in a fight that lasted 2 minutes. I'm not even kidding that the fight lasted 2 minutes with both of us shooting each other with medics healing from the side line. \n\nOn another note I went to set up my old tesla combo for the front of my car that I usual run for healing and ramming people who try to chase down my hurt teammates. I went from having 4 of the 3 blade tesla's to 0. Along with a bunch of my other parts for some odd reason they have vanished. I don't honestly fucking know why my shit has just vanished I just enjoy the fact that the tech tree is also not fully unlocked as I have over 110 fucking levels and some of the things like the flak cannons and tesla's are now locked and need to be unlocked with tech points. I love having to grind to get something I already owned all over again. Nothing like having my tesla blades vanish along with them being locked with various other parts i'm missing. \n\nAlso on this magical point that I'm making about my missing parts other people have posted about this in there reviews and on many complaint forums to get the same generic responce from the dev community guy saying he \"looked at there account\" and saw nothing was missing bullshit responce. What a fucking joke. It's as about as hilarous as there fucking \"free fair play rules\" What a fucking load of shit. Banning people perminantly off there game REALLY fucking smart great way to show that your a company is just fucked along with the still rapidly dieing game. \n\nWE ARE REMOVING CRATES!!!! hurray oh wait it doesn't fucking matter. It was announced and done far to fucking late for it to matter. The dev's and other people should have realized this when E.A. was going through this crate shit and seeing how fucking horrid the backlash was. Maybe it should have given them the thought that maybe this design could end up harming there game far more than i would benefit them at making fucking money. The honest to god thing you should not be focusing on as a fucking developer and game creator is how to make as much money as possible and should be focusing on oh I know \"THE FUCKING GAME\" your community is everything and as far as it seems the community dev is about as reliable as my fucking to go to space by sitting on a firecracker. What a fucking let down honestly. I wish this game hadn't fucking gone straight into the ground. \n\nSo for further note if my account is looked into and they claim nothing is missing I'm going to just laugh as my two friends I played this game with fondly remember me fucking gunning it into the battle that they where running from to fucking ram the nearest guy with my tesla fucking \"car pusher\" as the joke was implied. \n\nlastly as the most ammusing thing for all the people who posted about this game not being pay to win and shit the community post following the removal of crates just puts the cherry on top as they specifically call out and say they are sorry about the pay to win design. What a fucking laugh that gave me.

The items you get from crates at the end of a game are just complete useless, so useless that selling them for money is not even worth it. They are more useful as a \"dust collector\" then anything else. There is no more skill involved anymore as the devs also took that away. Brining in lock on missle launchers, and making that if you shoot your self you dont lose energy, which takes away from the entire point of being strategic with your shots and conserving energy. The distinction in classes which were; medic, sniper, support (plasma, laser) are just gone. Anyone can be eveything, which just takes away the fun of using strategy and working together to defeat the enemy.The 10 second heal which is that if your not shot with-in 10 seconds your robot heals. This just makes everyone go rambo cause they pretty much charge in, shoot, then heal, needing no medic or team-mates to help them defeat the enemy. And lastly, the pay-to-win aspect of the game (buying crates to get items, being able to buy legendary guns, buying items to boost heal regen, etc...) are just so damn gamebreaking that even with hundred of hours of grinding (which I have done in this game) someone spending money on the game could match you and destroy you with no problem.

The game was not only fun, and had great potential, but the developers were out to make a game, not a profit. They listened to their community, and strived to improve the game. After the \"New Meta\" update, a lot of people were angry, but a minority supported this direction. \n\nThis resulted in many neutral updates, and one of the most hated updates of all - Team Orders. The update removed what made Robocraft fun and enjoyable, and turned Robocraft into another Dota 2, except instead of heroes, you had bricks with guns attatched. Despite Freejam noticing, their attempt to fix the problem with \"Unleashed\" was not the Trump Card everybody wanted. They removed tiers, replacing it with \"Mk\", and added a whole lot of gimmicks. Soon, they completely removed tiers. \n\nAfter that, they continued to remove what made Robocraft unique. First tiers, then ranking, then level in general. Although I do like the paint system, tier flattening led to a lot of unbalanced items. They also unnessarily added new weapons - additions NOBODY wanted. And now they're still adding MORE weapons, while people are suffering from ghosting. Robocrafter YouTuber Lathrix had SEVEN games IN A ROW where somebody was ghosting (which is when a lagged out player damages and destroys other players even though they are destroyed). When the devs should've been fixing the game, they were adding to the game. \n\nNow, the average match is very simple - build a tesla plasma bot. Wait for your team to severely damage an enemy, and then go in for the kill. If you deal 80% damage to an enemy, killing the enemy will reward you with more points, which brings me to say the truth: In any Robocraft gamemode (The developers SPECIFICALLY stated that kill stealling was an option in the FFA gamemode \"The Pit\"), you are forced to fight against YOUR OWN TEAM. People become utterly selfish, not healing, and stealing a kill you worked hard to get. \n\nJust go to the reviews section of the Robocraft Steam Community, then scroll down, and savour the red square boxes with thumbs down symbols. It's so clear in the reviews. 3,691 recent reviews have been submitted, and 55% of those reviews (~2,030 reviews) are negative. Freejam is also silencing moderators who oppose the company, and actively responded on Twitter to the community \"deal with it\". Yet, they are still adding more weapons, that will a) add a potential risk for unbalanced weapons and b ) makes you want to spend real world money even more.\n\nFreejam has gone from a small indie developer team that made an award winning small free to play game that people put thousands of hours into, to a money hungry profit machine.\n\n[h1]How Freejam could improve the game:[/h1]\n\u2022 Make crates mono-tiered (or squashed), or just outright remove them. They're completely based on RNG and they just steal money from you. Premium doesn't change a lot of it. \n\u2022 Revamp the points system so that if you say deal 50% CPU damage, you earn 50 points while if you kill an enemy, you earn 10 points. This will counter kill stealing.\n\u2022 Fix ghosting. It can make a Protonium Crate earning hover bot that made someone put ten hours of their life to make the bot get to a Bronze Crate because a ghoster killed them.\n\u2022Get rid of the Premium Paint system.

I tried to give this new update a shot even though i kinda knew it would just **** it up even further than it already was. I do miss the old days. RIP Robocraft.\n\nHere is why:\nBefore in the golden days of Robocraft you had a tier system which imo was awesome since it created more balanced matches in higher tiers because you worked your way up learning the game, getting better at building and knowing how to play effectively etc which would make most matches competitive since everyone else in that high tier went through the same process. Yes there were cons to this since you could make tiny bot with an overtiered weapon to troll and kill newbs in lower tiers but that could easily been dealt with by restricting the use of these weapons in the lower tiers but now the balance is all over the place... each Robocraft big update more recently claimed to bring balance instead creating more imbalance by allowing inexperience players to play with veterans so you would get a situation where you are the only vet in the match on your team and the rest seem to be clueless and you are facing a team with more experienced players and they steam roll you or vice versa i'm on the team with the experienced players and we steam roll the newb team.... i find it hard to actually get a good game these days... to me a good game is when both sides find the match fun and competitive not just an easy win. The golden days of Robocraft is when you got good games and the people you played with or against were much more mature than these days.\n\nNow i didnt mind the tesla, tracks update i liked it... i didnt even mind the crazy fit any weapon you want on your bot update i still played even though the game was just a shadow of its former glory... you could still have a lil fun and mess around... but this most recent fast and formidable update is just.... i really dont know wtf to think... i feel like there is no goal anymore.. at least before you had levels to grind so you could get the max cpu... now it kinda seems pointless... there is no progession... they took are tiers, tokens, and now levels away from us.\n\nIf you are a new or fairly new player you will probably like this... well hopefully for freejams sake but all you vets out there thinking of coming back, it may just leave a bad taste in your mouth like it did me so thats why i cant recommend this game since its not the same game i fell in love with before it was even released on steam\n\nEDIT: oh and the god damn crates! THE ******* RNG KOREAN INSPIRED ******* CRATES!

I actually could still find some fun after the F&F update after messing around but now its just too boring. The final nail in the coffin was the recent fast n formidable balance changes... guess what? now you can stare at the protonium crystals on the towers and base long enough to feel bored from the first tower because protonotivity was reduced and some other things played a part too llike certain nerfs to energy n weapons.... matches can be painfully long and more ppl just alt+f4 it just to make the pain go away.\n\nI will be uninstalling the game right after this review.", "timestamp_created": 1479470312, "timestamp_updated": 1479748330, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 309, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.863118469715118408", "comment_count": 68, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26116893": {"recommendationid": "26116893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086041899", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 27088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456333207}, "language": "english", "review": "There's a reason this game's awards are all from 2013/14, this game was great.

They had some great ideas, some bad ideas, and overall just can't seem to solidify its design. The game itself, in the end, suffers- it's fun at its core, but the plethora of issues snowball into a massive tidal wave of problems that just can't be ignored. I certainly can't ignore them anymore.\n\nA lot of reviewers seem to suggest the fault lies in a few simple decisions that FreeJam made- such as removing tiers, removing megabots, adding crates, etc. The truth is, those actually weren't that big of a deal- yeah, they may have removed some features some people liked, but those were probably some of the few GOOD decisions they ever had (minus the crates, but we'll get to that in a minute).\n\nSo what is it, you ask? What makes this game virtually unplayable now? Well, in order to answer that, we've got to get into... basically everything. Almost every element of Robocraft is faulted and never fixed. While the idea of Robocraft is fun, the way the game works certainly isn't.\n\n#1: The building\n\nRobocraft is a game that's primarily about building a vehicular robot, then fighting other players' robots in a small handful of game modes. Basically, it's that idea you had as a kid- \"What if you could make your own lego tank and fight other peoples' lego tanks?\". A cool idea on paper- and certainly one that COULD be executed well- but not one that Freejam seems to be able to accomplish. The way the game plays out in practice is more akin to a MOBA- only instead of having a plethora of viable characters and builds to choose from, you can instead use your hand to count how many viable types of robots there are. \n\nYou have a lot of options, it would seem- wheels, various types of legs, tank treads, wings, hoverblades, helicopter blades, etc. They add in things that LOOK or SOUND cool, but certainly don't work in the regular game. Want to fly a robot with wings like a fighter jet? Too bad, drones are better, and you'll get shot down faster than somebody suggesting a good idea to Freejam.\n\nNow, as of writing this, the developers have stated they intend to balance out the various types of robots. They're rolling out an update for wheels and have said they're interested in re-balancing wings. Still, this feels like a bandaid- it's something they should have done from the very beginning. To be honest, I don't have much faith it'll work- almost every supposed balance update seems to just shift the meta, rather than balancing it. Because, again, the developers don't seem to really understand HOW to balance it.\n\nWhat's worse is that all the promo material and pretty pictures give you this idea that you can play these really cool looking things. Sure, you CAN.... if you want to be a useless team member who gets destroyed every game with ease. The reality is, only a small handful of robot designs \"work\". I'd be willing to accept that some reasonably work better than others- a lazy \"cube\" shouldn't work as well as a masterfully crafted tank. But that's not the case- literally almost every 'bot shown in the store screenshots and promotional material are worthless.\n\nThis turns the game into a min/max fest which seems to appeal to only a very small minority of players. The rest of the players- long time veterans, or new players alike- get left in the dust. The sad thing is, it doesn't even work as a competitive game- at least fighting games or MOBA's like League of Legends (which also have some character balance issues) have a competitive edge, but Robocraft can't even accomplish that.\n\n#2: The weapons\n\nAs with the robot types, weapons have horrible balance. Right now, the short range options seem like the only viable choices- namely, the shotguns (or \"Ion\" weapons). Of course, it wasn't always like this- once upon a time, it was the opposite, and the long range options were the only option (Railguns, Lasers). That's the problem, though- it's never at a point where all or most options are viable. \n\nYou're just left with the un-said but clearly received message of \"Well, you COULD choose things other than what works... but have fun fighting an uphill battle\". It's frustrating to be a clearly more skillful player, yet get absolutely trashed by players who are using the \"right\" equipment. Not even what should reasonably counter your weapon/robot loadout, either- the close-range ion users have absolutely no problem wrecking the long-range railgun users.\n\nAgain, I'm sure this will change- but it will only CHANGE, not get better. That's the problem.\n\n#3: Crates\n\nRobocraft seems to have taken a hint from CS:GO and decided to change its match reward system to a \"crate\" system. Your performance reflects the type of crate you get, which is great... in theory. The problem is that it's all still randomized- you'll very often just get total trash from crates. Recently, they seem to have updated the game to finally include the ingame currency again, but that's still just a bandaid. You're still left with swathes of content beyond your reach without grinding for AGES and selling the useless parts you constantly get (boy, I sure am glad I got another honeydew horn).\n\n#4: Terrible matchmaking\n\nAgain, Robocraft is a multiplayer game- its matchmaking system should be its strongest point, but it's not. Not only does it take forever to get into a match, but players can (and often will) leave matches or disconnect randomly. This wouldn't be such a big deal if they could reconnect, or other players could join in- but they can't. Once a player leaves, that's it- the game is basically already over with.\n\nFurthermore, there's absolutely no matchmaking balancing. At all. You're left with terrible matchups, where one team can be almost entirely anti-air, and the other team is all aircraft. You can see how this doesn't work out very well. It's a joke- a bad one.\n\n---\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend Robocraft anymore. I did, once upon a time, because it was fun and showed promise- but not anymore. Unless the developers make a total 180 and really balance the game all at once, it's going to die.

One day I opened up the game after an update. Basically it said, we are removing megabots and giving everyone who had megabots at that time about 2400 gc (can just buy a pile of crap). In addition to the bye bye to megabots, they decreased the amout of rp earned in a battle by like 90%. I just stopped playing then. I was angry, and the robocraft team got alot of complaints from me. Another update came along and I tried it. They took out all currency and replaced everything with crates you earn after a battle. This brought a little money balance back but the game still is not even close to as good as it once was. I just can't recommend it. It is ok right now but it was so extremely good at the beggining that it is horrible compared to what it used to be.", "timestamp_created": 1464140573, "timestamp_updated": 1464140573, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620043635368347168", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22715774": {"recommendationid": "22715774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123273612", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 121486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482815268}, "language": "english", "review": "Stay away from this game. Simply put, the development team (FreeJam) is utterly incompetent. There have been so many points in time where the game could have become significantly better with a few minor changes here and there (primarily related to rebalancing weapons/components or various quality of life changes). Instead, FreeJam ignores those high-impact low-hanging fruit, and instead decides to flip the entire game on its head and release major updates that change everything in a big way. This accomplishes nothing other than introducing a multitude of new problems, while rarely addressing those issues that could have been easily fixed. Sure, during the course of the coming weeks and months, FreeJam will slowly but surely resolve some of the screw-ups they made during their last update, until the game once again gets to that point where it could be great with just a few small changes...but then the cycle repeats itself and as expected, just on the horizon is another game breaking update.\n\nOther major issues with the game:\n\n1) Building/engineering used to be a major component of the game, and high level players used to take pride in their building skills. Nowadays, building skill is hardly worth anything anymore. Any new player can slap something together in 5 minutes and compete toe-to-toe against a bot that took hours to complete. In fact, don't even bother building anything, because within weeks, FreeJam will render your bot utterly useless by breaking it. Either they'll nerf your movement or make various components 10 times heavier, etc. Regardless of how they break it, just be ready to say goodbye to your favorite bots, as they won't be able to perform nearly as well as they once did \"because FreeJam said so.\"\n\n2) Significant weapon imbalances and easy-mode weapons. Simply put, FreeJam rarely gets weapon balance 100% right, or even close to it. In the current state of the game, there are weapons that are grossly overpowered, and there are weapons that are grossly underpowered. There are also weapons that take little to no skill to use, and yet have been high-impact weapons previously (a new patch attempted to address some of these issues, but the jury is still out). \n\n3) FreeJam doesn't care about players who have been around for years, players with thousands of hours in the game, players who have been active and have helped spread the word about the game. They won't listen to your feedback, no matter how good it is or how well-written it is. Instead, FreeJam does its own thing, with a bias towards catering to new players. Basic things that the competitive/veteran community has been requesting for years...still not here. Things like clans have been \"on FreeJam's radar\" since mid-2014 or earlier - and guess what? Still not implemented, and it is almost mid-2016. The sad part is, by the time FreeJam actually decides to implement clans, all of the top clans in the game will be dead, as all of their veteran members will find better things to do with their time than to play this. \n\n4) Minimal skill required. If you were looking for a game where putting in tons of hours would give you a significant skill advantage over new players, please look elsewhere. FreeJam has stated that they want the game to be more accessible to new players. This might be good for new players, but for anyone who has invested a significant amount of time into the game, it is just a slap in the face.\n\nFreeJam: One step forward, two steps back.

Over and over and over again, making a great game with potential into a piece of garbage, never truly fixing anything, just making Robocraft worse, into a husk of its former self. When I started playing Robocraft in its early days, I absolutely loved it. I had a great sniper spider(which are now absolutely useless and will win you nothing) and won so many games with it, and got lots of money as well(when you actually won money instead of a bunch of useless parts you can sell for less than 1,000 robits). I stopped playing it for a while, and when I saw there was a new update with megabots, I was all over it again, back with my sniper. It was the golden age of Robocraft, where the only people who didn't like the game were small raging children, though they hadn't taken away what the players liked in the game, but then the update came where everything changed, where the tech tree, that all veterans had laboured over for hours to unlock all of, was trashed, and when you no longer got the sweet reward of cold hard cash after winning a game, the day it became a pay to win game. A game where all you needed was some money and you got all the premium you wanted, where you could get protonium crates till your eyes bled. This, developers, is where you went wrong in my eyes, where you took almost everything aspect that people liked, but why you decided to do that, I will never know, because you probably don't care about those who liked the old version better than this hunk of junk you call a game. You nerfed planes and snipers to the point where you would never see either, because nobody would even touch one with a 79 and a half foot pole. They were once feared, the great weapons of the skies and shadows, but they were already balanced, although you didn't seem to see it as that. They were glass cannons, things you could kill in mere seconds, so it took skill to play them, but you nerfed rail guns and made every weapon a threat to a plane. This used to be such a good game. And now it's absolute trash. You have failed devs, and you failed badly.\n\nThis part goes to those who think \"this is just some angry veteran who doesn't like the change. Nobody cares!\" You people are the ones who probably have never played the older Robocraft, who never experienced the fun of Boss Battles, and I bet you didn't even know Robocraft had boss battles. Well, they did, but they took that away, just like every piece of the game that people liked in the first place. You don't even know how hard it was once to be a sniper, because I bet you probably have never played with one and kept it. You don't know the frustration of the enemy team having a healer when you don't, back when robots couldn't self heal. Let me tell you, a healer, back then, could just about single-handedly change the outcome of an entire game, making them actually useful. You have never experienced your team being destroyed by a singlular plane, but I bet you've never been killed by a plane. None of you were there when it was legitimately hard to go up in a tier because the blocks were so expensive(although that is one thing I would actually change about the old Robocraft, but people just accepted it, and I did too). You never had to unlock anything on the tech tree, and feel the hardships of getting to that gun or block that you wanted. You have no right to denounce the veterans of this game who have actual issues with this game, because you didn't experience this game when it was not only harder, but better. So much better, by leaps and bounds. You also may say that if you don't like the game its become, then don't play it, but the veterans of this game want to voice their opinion in hope that the devs will actually listen to the players and change it to be more like the Robocraft they loved, which you've never experienced. Yes, the old Robocraft was harder, but you actually needed skill to play it. There were strategies going into games, people actually working as a team, but now it's just charge into battle and hope for the best, with guns majorly out of balance, that are hard to get and are just about the only thing you actually need to be good, no actual skill required, just money.\nA message to devs, if you ever even read this, which I highly doubt. I bet if you released to old version of robocraft before all the massive changes(lets just say before the update with the missle laucher), that the new version would have barely anybody to keep it running, because, really, be honest with yourself. The old version had so much higher ratings, and there was so much more love for Robocraft. There might be more weapons and fighting styles in the new version, but nothing beats an actually good game(not what this game has become).

It was amazing at first and it was one of my favourite games, but then the devs decided to push a huge update that just ruined it! They removed the leveling system for blocks and mega bots which were an important  part of the game and took a really long time to save up for and a lot of work to get, then in addition they removed the whole levelled armour system. Having different tiers and strengths of armour brought strategy into the game, making it a fun and tactical game which was amazing and actually made the game balanced, but they removed that as well and replaced it with cubes with no differences in strength. What they thought would make this better is being able to paint the bots cubes, only 3 colours unless you pay constantly for premium to access the other colours of course! I can completely understand the 'colour you bot' idea, but my god what did we gain? At least give us some sort of tier system, or something other than this rubbish. If not, don't lock colours behind a pay wall, as this game was meant to be (initially) completely free to play. That idea went out of the window, along with the good game. Then they add dlc. Not your 'new maps and weapons' dlc, but the ability to pay \u00a325 for a couple of shitty cosmetics and crates. Oh and crates? They're the worst idea you've added yet!

Some for the good, mostly for the bad.[/b]\nMy previous reviews have always been positive, albeit quite criticising. \n\nAfter the recent removal of the megabots from the game, i installed it again. In ignorance? With hope?\nOr perhaps it was because FreeJam has given me that tiny bit of hope, that they would make robocraft great again.\n\nUnfortunately, with the recent edition of the shotgun, they just completely messed up and lost all of my trust.\n\nIncrease of TTK (Time to Kill)? That was a \"maybe\". Well, TTK is getting lower and lower with each passing day.\nSkill should be an important factor! Well, with the addition of 3 guns that really don't require much skill, really doesn't strengthen that comment. \n[b]FLAK[/b]: Introduced to sooth the pain of the players that lacked the skill to deal with drones. (What is shooting me? I don't see it? I'm looking everywhere, except of course above me, because i'm a ground vehicle)\n\n[b]LOML[/b]: Yes, this gun is as awesome as it sounds. Lock on and fire, no need to aim as the rockets will find their way to your target,\n\n[b]Proto-seeker[/b] (or as i call it, the turdgun): On first introduction, it was litteraly a gun that fired crap. It hardly did any damage and was just plain annoying. And you could fire it without your enemy even seeing you, due to the ridiculous range. Just aim in the general direction of your enemy and you would simply hit aim. No skill required.\nIn the next update, the range was nerfed, but the damage was buffed. \"Great\" job FreeJam.\n\nLet's talk about the \"making robocraft a competitive game\" comment that was made. It was most definitely a priority.\nhttps://twitter.com/MarkDJammer/status/613285367886667780\n\n- The leveling is now a lot easier. What used to take weeks/months to do, can now be done in 1 week or 1 month. Depending on how much and how often you play.\n- There is no more steadily unlocking of items. Meaning, combined with the leveling, new players who reach the end game in no time.\n- There are no tutorials in the game, so what you learn you learn by doing, without having any clue what or where to start. \n- The removal of the pilot seat: The importance of building a good (and competive bot) is no longer as important anymore. To \"balance\" this out, FreeJam decided to let your bot die, when it's at 25% health. It could still be functional and combat ready, but that no longer matters.\n- Regen: Another \"awesome\" addition to the game. Because removing a part of this \"competitive\" game wasn't enough. And likely to make up for that *facepalm* die at 25%, you will heal up if you're not being shot at for 10 seconds.\n- Tactical gameplay: Also note the irony in this part. In order to help the megabots (weren't they removed? Yep) move about more easily, about 50%+ of cover on all maps has been removed.\n- Ranked: Just because you call a square a ball, doesn't make it a ball. And \"ranked\" in Robocraft is as much ranked as a pig is a carrot. It doesn't matter what \"rank\" you have or what \"rank\" your enemies have, the end result is still the same.\nAll that matters is win and loss and if you lose, score. Be in the top half of the scoreboard when you lose and you will not lose \"rank\". There are 5 \"ranks\". Bronze (1-5), Silver(1-5), Gold(1-5), Diamond(1-5) and Protonium(1-5), with Protonium being the highest.\nThis is one of the biggest fails FreeJam has made, as far as competitiveness goes. As a bronze player, you can be fighting with and against even Protonium players. The matchmaker doesn't really care (if at all).\nThen there's the \"ranking up\". Just win and you'll rank up. Currently 6 wins in a row, will get you to the next \"ranking league\". \nCombine this with the \"awesome\" matchmaker and perhaps you will guess that being a high-ranking players doesn't mean anything, there's also no point. Whether you are on the bottom or the top, you'll be playing with the same kind of players. Even new players, who don't even know what to do (yet?)\nOne little note: The one reason to rank up is to get the league badges. They do look really nice.\n\nNow let's be honest... it can't be all negative, right? No, you are right. They did remove the tiering system and all armor is now the same. This means that artbots are actually viable. They also decreased the cost of the cubes you need to build your bot. AND... they added the paint tool. (4 colors standard, 16 (or was it 12?) with premium).\n\nSecondly, they added the CRF (Community Robot Shop) in which players can upload their own designs and allow other players to buy them. However, the rating system has a big flaw. You can only rate a bot after the first real battle. As such, the ratings mean little to none, just like its ranking system.\n\nConclusion: Robocraft is turning more and more into a game that you'll play for a while when you are bored. All the promises are basically ideas that can be withdrawn/changed or be completely the opposite.\nWould i recommend it? No. Not anymore. Robocraft Developers are basically like a 5 year old kid that has an attention span of a goldfish.\n\nNote: I have over 1000 hours in the game. As such, i do know what i'm talking about. I could boast about my ranking, but whether it's Bronze 0 or Protonium 5, it just doesn't mean a thing.\n\nDeveloper comment\n[quote]\nBy Sergii Design Jammer\n\nSurely we have no plans to revert everything we was working on for a year. Surely we avoid removing content from the game if we don\u2019t absolutely have to: after all, this will surely make many players unhappy.\n\nBut we are spending years of our lives working on the game. Surely we don\u2019t want to make the game worse.\n\nIt\u2019s well known fact that without content updates online games die quickly: players get bored and leave. So even if it was true that before Aeroflak the game was perfect, this perfect game won\u2019t last long without things like Aeroflak (i.e. without content updates making big impact). So to survive, the game needs to evolve constantly, even though many mistakes happen along the way for sure.\n\nSo the choice for us is to let the game die, or to evolve it. We understand the disappointment of players who liked the old ways more, but honestly leaving the game as is wasn\u2019t an option at every stage in the past and won\u2019t be in the future.

If the prices won\u2019t be fixed, then it is way too grindy to do anything, reforge values are incredible (75%+?). For example, from items that cost 20000 to forge you can only recover 25.\nFor newbies, I assume, it simply won\u2019t do. As well as for players, who don't already have everything.\nThey also divided RP/63 to get to Robits balance. \nHowever, if you were smart enough to buy thousands of weapons to reforge them, literally millions of money could be saved. I wasn't.\n\nCrates?\nEven with premium I get 3-6 simple blocks from gold/diamond/protonium crates. And some customization trash. And I can\u2019t even recycle it from the crate\u2019 screen. \nOh, since you can recover only a few robits from the crate, even protonium ones, good luck playing thousands of battles to get some weaponry. And only BA/LA battles, TDM gives 1/4 reward of BA/LA or 1/3 of The Pit.\nWant to donate to buy 300 crates and get some good items for you bot?\nYou will only get thousands of simple blocks and very few movement parts and weapons. But, duh, you will can tons of customization dirt.\n\nNewbie-friendly?\nAh yes, simple robot blocks. They are now 10x times more expensive, some newbies cannot even build a normal robot since they do not have enough money even for blocks.\nI do not even know how newbies can get into high-tier now, seeing everything is way too expensive even for old players.\nSo much of a newbie-friendly game. Also, the matchmaking with FJ' fixes.\n\nMatchmaking?\nDid I mention that even 500 CPU (sized) bots are still thrown into 1500-1750 CPU battles?\nAh, now I did. \nAlso many afk's, since being afk and wait till the battle's end is much more profitable than trying to do anything.\n\nRobot-building?\nForget about it, simply place some cubes, just make sure it is not too hollow, some weapons, at least 6 of them, and you are ready to go.\nBuilding does not really matter for a long time.\nOf course, there is a meta-builds, but why build it when you can buy it from roboshop?\nObviously, FJ undestands it and now you can buy it for free.\n\nGame-modes?\nThe Pit is incarnation of killstealing along with ion distorters little bots. Not very interesting.\nTeam Deathmatch is a good mode still, however, FJ hates this mode and to promote Battle Arena they made severe nerfs to rewarads from TDM, so if you like to play TDM you will never get much money (now you really won't get anything, since you get only one item from the TDM and you can recycle for around 50 robits, while new weapons and modules cost thousands and hundreds of thousands).\nBattle Arena/League Arena - gamemodes with highest rewards right now. FJ likes to think they are making game similar to MOBA and promote this gamemodes as hard as they can, reducing rewards from other gamemodes and increasing rewards in BA/LA.\nHow bad BA/LA?\nSmall maps, countless campers, in the lattest update you are guaranteed to lose if you have Robocraft's target auditory (10-12 year old kids, from FJ's comment on the official forums) and one or more disconnected people or leavers.\nSo, if you want to play BA, do not forget that disconnect and wait for two minutes is much faster than try and lose in the battle witch lasts for 15-20 minutes in average. \n\nWeapon rebalance?\nHigh-tier battles became way too boring and low-tier battles are full of shotgunners.\nSeriously, a few shots from SMG and you have no energy. And SMG's don't really damage anymore.\nProtoseekers, which I disliked, first were changed into close-combat ones, which was much less fun than longranged annoying weaponry, but now they were nefted into dirt and completely pointless to use.\nPlasma?\nUnless you manage to land the hit into dead center of the robot it is weak and after each strike you can go to make a tea to wait for energy to reload.\nRails?\nOh, somewhat useful, one of two weapons that can damage enemies now. But you have only two shots before you have to wait ~10 seconds to energy to restore.\nIon distorters?\nOnly weapon of close combat capable of 1-3 shotting any bot. And there are many of glass-cannons on low-cpu battles literally humiliating newbies, who can do nothing against them.\nFJ also told that low-tiered weapons will be useful.\nThey are not, however still being a little better than high-tiered ones. Still bad. And forcing to turn beatuful bot into cactus of small plasmas/smgs is a disgrace.\n\nModules?\nBlink is fun, this much I can tell. One of the best ideas FJ made ever.\nInvisility is strictly limited to shotgunners, has some uses for planes and copters, but not much.\nMegamodule turned into powerboost is a must in high-tiers, without it there is simply too big delay in weapon' fire.\nDisc Shield Module is not really of use now, but I sometimes see someone to use it only to enemy rush through it and kill the DSM' user with ion distorter (shotgun).\n\nBugs?\nOne of my friends can\u2019t play, since he is getting white screen/falling underground/crash issues.\nHe is, obiously, not the only one.\nAnd I got another fps drop, but I am used to it.\n\nExploits?\nFJ removing bonus to players' score when the latter spot the enemy to fix exploits.\nI really think it is not a way to fix exploits. \nAnd desync is still not fixed, FJ cannot into fixes, duh.\n\nEAC?\nPoints 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are still relevant. They are seriously doing almost nothing.\nAs for point 2 - I do not see crashes and issues with the game in the last update, but in previous update I could start the game only a few times out of ten, because EAC would simply not start and then the game would crash since EAC is not running.\nAs for point 3 - now it is hard to understand if it's FJ's fault for optimization or the EAC's, so I can't say anything about it. To be honest, optimization is not very bad, however, there are lag-spikes and sluttering with micro-freezes from time to time. \n\n\nI am not saying I am quitting, I already have more than 20+ detail each and some robits, so I will stay to see when FJ hits the rock bottom. Seeing this update it shouldn\u2019t be too far away.\nHowever, this update is much worse than I expected and I expected something bad.\nI am disappointed in FJ and especially Mark, the latter one could read the forums and not hide in his twitter ignoring any messages that matter and making silly updates which make the game worse.\nI really do miss the classic robocraft without regeneration and with pilot sits.\n\n(Updated 29.04.2016)\n\n\nOLD:\nNew anticheat EAC does not prevent hackers to use hacks, yet it:\n1. prevents the usage unsigned drivers\n2. gives absolutely horrible matchmaking, almost always kicks from game and if be lucky enough to get into the game you may get into the middle of the match (and get kicked again), too many false positives and crashes\n3. cause of low framerate\n4. messes with other software outside robocraft\n5. dissallows software like fraps and macroser even when they used on other programs\n6. recognized as malware by some antiviruses\n7. EAC devs suggest you to run the game in virtualbox if you encounter problems like unsigned drivers\n8. There is no guarantees gathered data (screenshots, keylogging, logins, passwords, usernames, chat messages, etc) from you will be kept private.\n\nI do not think it is the full list of the issues.\nBy the way, I mostly run the game without turning on steam, so I do not have much hours on the record.\nAlso my friend's brother died from this.\nHe had serious depression and robocraft was his only relief. \nBut then FJ started \"patching\" the game and as game progressivly got worse he couldn't bear with it, stole the gun from his dad and killed himself when there was nobody home.", "timestamp_created": 1461925445, "timestamp_updated": 1465491313, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 217, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750002145767211914", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26148729": {"recommendationid": "26148729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163361425", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506857003}, "language": "english", "review": "Used to be an actual good game that I played almost every day, but then all the updates came and mucked it up. \n", "timestamp_created": 1477070518, "timestamp_updated": 1477070518, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 237, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.776524066925048828", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23618373": {"recommendationid": "23618373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121435263", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461452976}, "language": "english", "review": "tl;dr Was good, then became a p2w. Avoid unless you have a massive disposable income and are fine with a company trying to swindle you.\n\nI got into this game a year or two ago. A genius idea it was back then. Near unlimited creativity, fun gameplay, a good community, low lag, yadda yadda yadda. That's all auxillary stuff. It's what makes a good game into a great game. But what about the essential stuff? It was all there, too, and in innovative fashions: a well-developed and balanced tech tree, specialization to create diverse teams, currency rewards based on how well you performed, quick and fair matchmaking, the list goes on and on. All of this was essential; you play well, you get currency, you upgrade your robot in the direction you want, and you go through the tiers, facing harder opponents as you go.\n\nAh, what I wouldn't give to go back to the days when this game wasn't a steaming pile of pay-to-win trash.\n\nCreativity? Gone. Premade robots are the only real contenders now. Why is that?\nProgression? Gone. Now you get a linear tech \"tree\" that unlocks without the tech points of before.\nHow do you get new parts, you ask? Why, with the currency of course!\n...Except not the same currency.\nNow you get a currency which is only granted to you based upon how many parts you sell. And how do you get these parts?\nWith the completely original and foolproof crate system, how else?\nFor just a single match, YOU can get a crate of at least five items that YOU didn't choose. Oh, not even that, though, since one is dangled in front of your face like a pet toy, essentially going, \"You COULD have this, but you have to be a PREMIUM MEMBER!\"\nAnd there's the center of the problem. Membership.\nJesus H. Christ on ice skates, membership costs so much that you'll need to just start paying with your dignity. $1.99 a DAY. That's about $60 a month -- money that could EASILY buy you at least three retail games on sale, or a full-price title -- and about $725-730 a year. \nYou could buy at least 25 decent games with that kind of money.\n\nOh, but that's not even the half of it.\nWhat do you get for your money? Well, you get:\n-A color wheel (Did I mention you only get a whopping FOUR colors to choose from, if you're a normal member?)\n-Some rare weapons in crates (that don't do nearly as much damage as they originally did)\n-Instant access to the stronger weapons (I omit the word \"tier\" because there IS no tier system any more; little Johhny that just joined the game and threw together a gun on a car frame with no armor will go up against someone with 2,000 hours with a fully decked out air bomber. Funny thing is, if you get lucky, you can take down the \"highest level\" players with entry-level gear.)\n-Some cosmetics and stuff that don't do anything\n\n...I think you get the gist. It's not worth it.\nSo, in conclusion, it's a prime example of what happens when money goes to a dev team's head but they want to keep that \"free to play\" sticker on Steam so poor losers with nothing in their wallet can actually play something. Or, rather, suckers with too much money to spend waste it on their pay to win scheme.

That update has made it literally the hardest thing to do due to it's mechanic. It could've been handled better like just a new reward you get along with earned currency.

Only then may you reach the top and stay there for a couple of weeks before more dumb shit is added so you can grind and grind even more.\n\nPreviously the game had a purpose and a set objective, which was you getting to the highest tier (TX-1) and unlocking everything step by step in the tech tree. Everything had a tier except cosmetics - weapons, cubes, thrusters, you name it. Each tier cube had a unique colour too. Black cubes was a symbol of respect, everyone followed you around and hid behind you since you could take the most damage, while purple cubes were not a symbol of respect. These days you can colour your whole bot in four ugly colours, white, grey, pale orange and pale blue. All of the nice colours are hidden away behind premium. Oh boy, premium! Just 99p a day! Who do you think I am, the prince of Nigeria?\n\nIf you had a T2 bot, you were matched fairly against players from your own tier. Even if you had T6 railguns, you were still put with players of the same level. What about today? Newbies and veteran players all get grabbed in handfuls and mashed together into a \"match\". Who pays the most for rocket launchers and legendary bull shit is the winner in every match, even if you played the game from the alpha version, you can get owned in 1 second by some snobby spoiled little tw4t with a rich daddy's credit card. Don't even get me started on the crates in this game.\n\nItems were purchased with GC (galaxy cash) or RP (robo points iirc), but you could not buy a million GC with your rich daddy's credit card to get the highest level stuff. Instead you needed tech points to unlock items, which were only available through playing the game. You unlocked items in the tech tree, in which cubes, weapons, wheels, electroplates etc. were unlocked level by level using tier tech points. These tech points are earned after every battle, and were unique to each tier. If your bot is T10 for example, you would earn T10 tech points, with which you were able to unlock a variety of T10 equipment, but nothing higher or lower. You could also convert these tech points to uber tech points (using GC) which could unlock every item from every tier. The tech tree was BALANCED. Why break a working, operational system? Are you really that money hungry, freejam? You should rename yourself to paidjam or gamblejam.

I highly recommend that you don't play it.\t[/h1]\n\n\n[h1] I ask in [u]Your[/u] best interest to Not Play this game\t[/h1]\n\n[h1] Enter the Shredzone [/h1]\n\nThe Shredzone update could have been the update to fix all of the problems the community has with this game. I would like to bring your attention to the could have part of that statement. Starting with the recycling rate. 10% of the part cost is returned to you. Only Bloody 10%! We can't even come close to buying any of our desired parts. All hope for the parts we want is now based on RNG-sus. This is all thanks to the Loot crate update which added these idiotic loot crates for us to gamble our parts. Most of the time, the parts are useless to us. 50% of the recycle price would be nice as it would finally make things affordable instead of needing to pray to RNG-sus in hopes of gaining the parts we want. At least this update has added an great tutorial for newer players, giving them false hope that they will enjoy the game. By the time they realise that the game isn't actually that much fun, they would have spent money on the game, to gain the advantage of [i]having more blocks[/i]. However, i honestly doubt that using this method, FreeJam will be able to claw their way out of the abyss of debt that has been accumulated. They have finally taken account of some feedback from players which is a step in the right direction. The changes are mainly to the weapons and not outstanding issues which many players are trying to bring to light. Finally, the new chaingun, another weapon added to \"balance out the game\". Laughable due to the fact that this type of weapon can be achieved using multiple wasp SMGs. This game is finally unsavable. All we can do now is sit back and watch the game run itself to the ground.\n\n[h1] Battle For Earth (outdated) [/h1]\n\nNew update, new edit. Welcome all to the \"improved\" Robocraft, Battle for Earth. Here we shall squeeze every last penny off you, through methods which have been tried and tested by multiple one-hit-wonder android games. The grind, i assure you, will be real. But who cares about that when you can spend countless amounts of dollars to be able to buy protonium crates. These crates will give you the advantage against others as you will be able to build not five, not ten, but only one decent robot a day (provided that you keep buying 300 crates every day). Pleas for changes are fallen on deaf ears as the developers have not addressed any issues raised in the previous update.  If any existing players are reading this, i ask you in your best interest to boycott this game. Any new players can refer to the title. (I'm lazy that way, don't judge me too harshly)\n\n[h1] Epic loot update (outdated) [/h1]\nWell Well Well... Finally, new update is out and once again, the update has broken the game to an even more unplayable state. Anyone who has played the game since the very beginning has seen the evolution of a once promising game, become a hideous monstrosity. With the new \"Epic Loot\" update, the game has now sunk deeper in to the lowest common denominator. Copying other games. Of course we all know which game this is trying to copy *cough cough* CS Go *cough cough* it is now almost impossible to progress. The game in my professional opinion has become so unplayable that even i, who have never reviewed a game before, have reviewed this game to comment on how horrendous it has become. The game is still in early access. I mean for crying out loud, this has to be an bigger scam since the Nigerian prince (still waiting for the transfer) and the metropolitan police (need to wait for the money from  the Nigerian prince to unlock PC). It is just a horrible excuse to change the game dramatically without much consideration for the existing player base\n\n[h1] The Epic Loot Update\t[/h1]\n\nNow this update is obviously released out of greed. Play one game and you will see what i mean. The loot crates give premium users more than double (epic and rare items) what players who play for free get. Although you may argue that premium users should get more, it demonstrates the desperation that the developers have for [b] Money\t[/b]. This is what the update is released for. The rail cannons now use more power per shot and smgs don't fire as quickly as before. Medics are now obsolete, repairing robots slowly enough that i can make an cup of tea, write this review as well as watch an couple youtube videos before they are fully healed (excluding the 10 second self repair of course).Ask any person who journeyed with robocraft throughout the years and they will tell you that \"[u] Robocraft has been ruined\t[/u]\"\n\n[h1] What to expect\t[/h1]\n\nBy playing for free, you only get four colours, less Robits (previously known as RP), stress from grinding as well as high blood pressure from realising that most, if not all, shotgunners that killed you were or are premium.  The battle arena is a blatant attempt to copy [spoiler] League of legends and DOTA\t[/spoiler] and incorporate MOBA into the game. Team death match is just destroying robots (No respawns). The main point of the game is building robots and fighting, which this game does quite well. However, needing to destroy at least 75% of the enemy's robot, now without the pilot seat, is an absolute deep pain in the ass. Especially if all that is left is a thruster and a single block. The reduction in speed of the SMGs have definitely bent each one of us over and screwed us, since it only takes 10 seconds to start auto repair, the singe thruster bot would have full repaired by the time we tracked it down.\n\n[h1] Explanation\t[/h1]\n\n\"It isn't all that bad\" you may say, innocently or while the developers are elbow deep in your rear and skillfully puppeteering what you type and say. Most of my hours came from the very start, but there are quite a few things which turned me away from wanting to play this game:\n[list]\n    [*]Removal of tech points\n    [*]The removal of megabots\n    [*]The addition of extremely OP weapons\n    [*]The removal of the tech tree\n    [*]The lack of consideration to long time players\n    [*]Removal of the pilot seat \n[/list]\nThat is barely scraping the surface of the problems. I am not demanding in-game items to be given to me. What I am asking for is [strike] for 25% of their stock with a certificate to be served to me on an silver platter and 10 percent of their profits\t[/strike] change. For example, adding in again the pilot seat will bring the fun back into building to defend the seat (the description [u]still[/u] says \"Jump into the pilot seat of your robot and drive it into battle...), adding in the challenge mode to encourage team work(with megabots of course).\n\n[h1] Final thoughts [/h1]\n\nThere are a number of things I quite like in robocraft right now, but listing one or two them would require more effort than the developers have put into the new ideas. Each update is well presented, but taking a massive dump on the game and putting a bow on it [u]Does Not[/u] conceal the fact that the game has been defiled (well that ship sailed a long time ago). Any new idea implemented causes dramatic change to the game from the developers basing the whole game around the update. Download and play it if you want, but keep in mind that it will never be as gripping as it once was. I rate this new update 1/10 but 10/10 for the game's concept.

In 95% of cases, you either bend down uncompromisingly, or bend over you. The remaining 5% is a normal, interesting fight. When hit in one battle with an invisibility-equipped Tesla, the odds of winning greatly fall, with two Tesla in the opposite team losing 80%, with three 100%. And this is not even discussed, in this situation it is simply not possible to do anything. Tesla can not catch up and can not escape because She is the fastest robot. To release a full party in 5 people versus 5 singles, is a normal phenomenon. Also the chance of winning depends critically on how many players will fly out. About 1% when a fight is 3 by 1 instead of 5 by 5. About 5% of battles is 3 by 5. Another 20% is 4 by 5.\nAttitude of support, samogod.

Let me remind you that this avatar existed for more than 1000 hours of play and did not break anything.\nAs a result, we have a spoiled game with a brazen moderation.

It was a game where you battled to get more stuff for your ship, used the stuff to battle and get more stuff, and eventually unlock cool items to put on your ship. Players were sorted into \"tiers\", which were general leagues of power for a ship. You simply could not place powerful items on your ship and expect to keep facing noob players. The tier concept allowed good players to maximize ships for specific laugues of players, and for less skilled players to know that, once they place enough items on their ship to go into a new tier, they will be at a slight dissadvantage unless they prepare right.\n\nIt made the concept of unbalanced gameplay less unbalanced. Now, unfortunately, you know absolutely nothing about your opponents, or whether specific items will be overspending for your level and land you in a new group of opponents, or if your weapons aren't quite powerful enough to face off with the people at your level. You go in blind, and can't even leave the damn match with any means other than the task manager when you screw up your build. This could mean a solid ten minutes of gameplay in which you are simply wasting your time.\n\nIf it's really a concern about unbalanced teams after someone leaves, then just throw in one of those pre-made ships piloted by an AI or something. Or better yet, don't make it a damn trial and error session just to make a ship for a specific group. I couldn't even make a ship with nothing but cubes and a few smg's without getting blasted apart by people outside my preparation.\n\nSeriously, I don't know what to use and what not to use.

I understand it's in Early Access, and I understand this is only one 'phase' of many. Who knows? Maybe in the future, I'll end up wiping this review and posting another one, but here are some finer key points of my letter, and the reasoning behind those points.\n\nTL;DR Game used to be good, now the balance sucks, and the economy is worse. Wrote a letter, here's some points and clarification.\n\n[h1]Damage and Balance[/h1]\n\n*Lock On Missile Launcher\n\n[quote=/u/RichterRicochet]\"...Those were the days, when you could fly and not get shot down by Flak and LOML* walker bots with ease... ...because the Flak system has not been properly crafted to focus on AIR targets.\"[/quote] This point was my first. In real life, Flak shells are used as Anti-Aircraft weaponry, because the shells can be fired high into the air and explode, leaving shrapnel to tear planes apart. \n\nHowever, in Robocraft, the 'AeroFlak Cannon' (aptly named so as to make you believe that it should be used against airborne targets) instead causes significant damage with those same shrapnel explosions to anything not connecting with the ground, whether they're meters in the air, or a few centimeters off the ground. These explosions hit all blocks within the explosion radius and can potentially destroy a bot in as little as three well placed shots.\n\nNot only that, but if the shells don't explode and connect with a player directly, they do their standard explosion damage, though given in a smaller radius. Mind you, the AeroFlak Cannon is a high-powered weapon. The damage is does is very significant, and you're likely to take massive damage, even if you're hit directly. With this in mind, you'd think that the trade-off would be either a very low rate of fire, or a higher power consumption (more on that in a moment). Surpisingly, no. The Flak fires at a steady pace of roughly once a second, however, add more guns, and you're firing more often. Roughly twice a second.\n\nNow, regards towards power. Each robot has a power meter that goes from 100% to 0% and recharges over the course of ten seconds (or eight, if you have the optional Power Booster attached to your robot). Here's the problem that we face with the Flak cannon. It has only a power consumption rate of 10.8% per shot, allowing you to fire off at least 10 before needed to recharge (however, the power is recharging constantly, meaning you may face upwards of 11-13 shots before the enemy needs to recharge completely). Worse still, it does over 30,000 damage a shot, and your average armor cube has 2100 health, meaning at least 13 or 14 armor cubes are getting toasted. (The damage does fall off in the blast radius, thankfully, but not by much.)\n\nBut that's not all folks! These cannons are damn near indestructible, with over 130,000 points of health themselves. And, if you do not directly hit the weapon block, it doesn't take damage. The only exception to this is Plasma weaponry, which has a small explosion radius (roughly the size of a grenade), which leads into my next point, surprisingly.\n\n[quote=/u/RichterRicochet]\"Those were the days, when plasma damage was actually reasonable, and Plasma weapons were affordable... ...I've taken several low tier plasma weapons and placed them up against walker bots with seemingly little armor... ...even after a full hail of plasma shots... ...only a few blocks are destroyed... The damage is absolutely abysmal.\"[/quote]\n\nAnd by golly, is that true! In a recent update Plasma weapons (or grenade launchers, as they could be considered) were actually REDUCED in damage, compared to their high powered counterparts. As a trade, they instead were given a higher blast radius and lower power consumption. But, there in lies a problem. If a player cannot do enough damage to destroy a high-powered weapon at short-to-medium distance (as is Plasma's intended purpose), then what use do they have on a player's robot? Now, understandably, higher tiered weaponry does do considerably more damage, but at that power consumption and fire rate trade off, the Plasmas were more balanced than the AeroFlak Cannon. Need proof? The second highest tiered Plasma, an Epic Quality item (just like the Flak, an Epic quality), has 40,000 health (roughly), does 38,000 points of damage (roughly) with a slower fire rate than the flak cannon, and a lower blast radius. So, while they do roughly the same amount of harm, the Plasma was balanced in such a way that it could be combated and successfully defended against, unlike the Flak cannon.\n\n[h1]Engines, and how useless they can be.[/h1]\n\n[quote=/u/RichterRicochet]\"Those were the days, when engines actually had the power to push something, instead of just gently dragging it off the ground to simply float in the air. I have [a ship] which has over eight separate engines pushing it forward... The ship isn't maneuverable in any way, and it's not meant to be... ...I expect it to be able to fly, on even maybe four engines. But, if I lose my main rear engines... ...my altitude drops steadily, and immediately, with no way to get back in the air until a heal; by which time, my enemy has already caught me...\"[/quote]\n\nThis was one of my biggest issues. The game expects players to have an understanding of physics when it comes to building flying robots, as in where to put wings and how much force required to get a vehicle off the ground. Yet, I don't believe even the developers do. The engines in this game are vastly underpowered, requiring usually no less than five to get someone off the ground. The smaller engine tiers hardly provide any lift at all and I wonder why they're still relevant. Now, I'm going to point out, the robot in reference here has 6 of the highest tier and two of the next tier down pushing it forward, and the acceleration and lift are absolutely meager. I'm surprised the damn robot flies at all.\n\n[h1]Community Backlash, pricing and other various points.[/h1] \n\n[quote=/u/RichterRicochet]\"Those were the days, when Megabots ruled, prices were moderately fair, and recycling really meant recycling and not shredding... ...[Players had] bought all the parts that they needed to sustain themselves for a while, and now [after] the Epic Loot update, those prices were cut from 50% return, which is moderately reasonable to in some cases less than 33%... ...to top that, the prices of some items went up, further blocking progression, and yet again causing more community outrage...\"[/quote] God, bored of this review yet? Oh wait, points... So! The economy in the game drastically shifted with the introduction of Epic Loot, because gone were the days of battling for currency, instead now you battled for parts that dropped in a random crate after each battle. The better you did, the better the crate (from Rusted to Protonium). However, you'd be led to believe that Protonium crates would offer higher tiered items, the Epic and Legendary ones. Yet after testing players have shown a very low drop rate for these items. Players would often hope for Movement or Weapon parts, but would frequently receive cosmetics instead, these cosmetics \"recycling\" for a very low currency count. (I.E. a 10,000 robit flag resold at 750 robits.) \n\n\"At this point, this is not a game I wish to see to completion, it's really not. Because if the current 'meta' is to stand in a similar fashion... ...then there will never be any balance... New players will come in, get rekt, pack up and leave... I've never been one to complain... ...I now understand why people are so upset.\" As an avid supporter of the game, I've not only poured time into it, but money as well.
