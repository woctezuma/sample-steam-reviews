When I played it back in 2010-2011, I didn't realize how good it actually was. And I'm talking about both experiences: singleplayer and multiplayer. Now, 2016, I bought this game on the steam winter sale. And god, what a good choice this was.\n\nThe multiplayer is the strong point of MW2. The community may be smaller now, since there have been so many new CoD games, but there are still people playing. You can find a party even at 4am on a wednesday. The multiplayer quality is fantastic. The amount of content keeps you coming back for more. A lot of customization options, which includes call signs, emblens, perks, attachments... Killstreaks are a good reward for the players skills. I personally like the matchmaking system instead of dedicated servers, because it keeps the game alive, because everyone can become a host, we all know there are a lot of limitations to host a dedicated server. \n\nThere is also a mode that can be played both singleplayer and multiplayer, called Special Ops. Here you do some very cool missions, usually not very long. They use some locations from the campaign. But it's very good because it's VERY challenging. It's very skill based, and it will take you some time and patience to do all Spec Ops missions. It's much more fun to do with a friend rather than doing alone. Spec Ops gives MW2 a very unique perspective over the other CoD games, because in my opinion it's a better mode than Survival and Zombies.\n\nAnd then there's the singleplayer campaign, which continues the story from MW in a very good way. The story is short, you can probably beat it in 3-4 hours on the regular difficulty, but it's a very entertaing story about war. Although you probably wont spend a lot of time in this mode, you will enjoy the cinematics and the whole story a lot.\n\nIs MW2 the best CoD game so far? Yes. Best FPS game so far? No, but one of the best.\nBut wait, isn't the game too old? Yes and no. \"Yes\" because it was launched 7 years ago, but \"no\" because the game aged really well in all aspects.

I have reviewed all three parts of the game if you are considering buying this. \n\nCAMPAIGN REVIEW (Single Player):\n\nThe campaign is about 6 hours long roughly. It can be shorter or longer depending on your selected difficulty. The story itself is very good and is set 5 years on from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. It is not a Hollywood Blockbuster but at the same time it is not some random quickly written story that was put together in a few hours. Every mission has different objectives and you can feel the climax building up to the finale of the game. Every level is action filled and there is never a dull moment in the campaign. As you progress you will play in different locations in the world such as: Afghanistan, Brazil, Russia, the Atlantic Ocean and the United States. Even after completing the story there are Intel collectables to find and of course Steam achievements. There are also quite a few Easter Eggs in the campaign levels. The story for this then continues on into Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3\n\nSPEC OPS REVIEW (Single Player / CO-OP):\n\nThe Special Op missions are mostly the campaign levels but switched the other way round and with different objectives in the level. There are a total of 23 spec ops missions in MW2. 21/23 of these can be done on your own or with a friend. There are 2 Spec Ops missions that can only be done with a 2nd player. The missions get harder and harder as they go on. Some of the levels in this have been re-used from COD4. There is no matchmaking for the Spec Ops so the only way to find another player is to invite / join a friend and begin playing. There are also quite a few Steam achivements for this like with the Campaign.\n\nMULTIPLAYER REVIEW (Multiplayer):\n\nThe Multiplayer is what is considered the strongest part of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Unlike COD4 this time the game uses Steam Cloud, so your rank will all be stored online and will sync every time you close MW2. The highest level you can reach is level 70 with the addition of 10 prestige levels. When you reach Rank 4 you will have the ability to create your own classes where you can choose your main weapon, secondary weapon, perks and equipment. You can also stick attachments to pretty much all of your weapons on here. You can also unlock weapon camos for your main firearms, which some look very cool when placed on. You have the ability to join friends in a session and vice versa (provided there is space) and host your own private matches for this. \n\n\nConclusion: I highly recommend buying this game if you are reading this out of personal interest or if the game has gone up for sale. I recommend playing the Campaign before going to Multiplayer to get a feel of the game, but it is of course entirely your decision.\n\nThings to be aware of - \n\nThere is no direct controller support for this game. \n\nIf you are considering the DLCs, it should be noted that there are less players than that of 2009 - 2010, so the only two main playlists are the base game and those who own both of the DLCs. If you only buy 1 DLC, you will find literally 0 games on there.\n\nMW2 Multiplayer has no dedicated servers. It uses a matchmaking system that will pair you up with other players in the same playlist and game mode as you.\n\nThis game uses VAC. So if you are banned for cheating / modding the game, your ban will be permanent. There is no way to lift a ban. You have been warned.\n\nAt the time of posting the Multiplayer peak for this is around 10,000 players which is more than enough to find a game and play. Campaign / Spec Ops population doesn't go above 5,000.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns with the game feel free to leave a comment.\n\nSingle Player / Spec Ops Hub - http://steamcommunity.com/app/10180\nMultiplayer Hub - http://steamcommunity.com/app/10190\n\nThank you for reading and enjoy the game if you decide to purchase!", "timestamp_created": 1385414147, "timestamp_updated": 1411848316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 475, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.882103443145751953", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25216530": {"recommendationid": "25216530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158623484", "num_games_owned": 450, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1965, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547838740}, "language": "english", "review": "The good ol days back when CoD wasnt garbage.", "timestamp_created": 1472421783, "timestamp_updated": 1472421783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 159, "votes_funny": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.850538134574890137", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45766830": {"recommendationid": "45766830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112020811", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1541754446}, "language": "english", "review": "Actually this game is a masterpiece!

I game from work mostly as the connection is top quality there. When the game selects me as host it allows me to clear the game of the things that make it unplayable such as cheaters and lag. (Most players claim to be a good host or have a good connection, this is what I game on: http://www.speedtest.net/result/6887526429 )\n\nOverall, MW2 is the best cod imo (under the right circumstances)\n\n\n-----\n -> Cheaters (aimbot [player aimlock], wallhacking [seeing through the wall], texture hack [manipulated textures in-game which give you a viewing advantage])\n\n -> Lag and poor host selection (Lag means failing to keep up with another or others in movement or development).\n\n\nTo a player:\n\u2022\tlag can cause your aim to seem `off` and result in a lot of hitmarkers\n\u2022\tlag will cause your shots and explosions to appear late (delayed) on your screen - you may think you knifed someone and then a few moments later, you`re dead and you think BS. Either you, the other player or both of you had a lag which resulted in what you saw.\n\u2022\tlag can cause rubberbanding (warping) and or player teleporting\n\u2022\tlag can cause your players position to reset (while it appears as if you ran half a mile to a building, you could find yourself back where you were a few moments later, as if you did nothing)\n\n\nSo if you have a slow internet connection, it`s not a good idea to run background downloads or uploads while you play, or stream music or watch video content. If your internet is slow, downloads/uploads could be done overnight or during the day when you`re out. Music could be downloaded to your PC and played locally. Videos could be watched from another device like a laptop, tablet or phone (preferably on another network e.g. mobile data, neighbours wifi etc).\n\nTo summarise, lag is annoying and players should do all they can to reduce their chances of ping spikes as it`s possible to lag in any and every online game no matter how good the `server` is.\n\nSome guides you may find useful:\nHow to identify a good host - https://steamcommunity.com/groups/mw2gamingnederland/discussions/0/1696048879948788239/\nWorkaround solution for Mac users - https://steamcommunity.com/groups/mw2gamingnederland/discussions/0/1727575977559594974/", "timestamp_created": 1529233348, "timestamp_updated": 1530897692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.808443307876586914", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15115773": {"recommendationid": "15115773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015893164", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546196991}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Call of Duty...No exo crap suits or crap ops will change that", "timestamp_created": 1427661184, "timestamp_updated": 1427661184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800289571285247803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38761481": {"recommendationid": "38761481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100002619", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1533186474}, "language": "english", "review": "Still a classic boots-on-the-ground CoD.

I was fascinated with how fun and \"realistic\" it was. I was immediately hooked on the games. I played Cod 2 and 3 religiously, and I will never ever forget the day I heard about Modern Warfare. Finally. FINALLY a game of 21st century setting. I was ecstatic. I played through the campaign and had endless hours of multiplayer logged on my Xbox 360. After doing everything I thought possible in that game, my dream came true, and another was released. To some, there's almost no difference between CoD4MW, and MW2. To others, like myself, there's an indescribable gap between the two games, where MW2 is on a whole new and higher level. To me, no other shooter game has had the balance MW2 had. It has set a standard for me that I look to in other FPS games, often times I find no equal, save the original Black Ops game. This balance is what made the game for me. I've never been a person to be \"naturally\" good at video games. MW2 was one where I excelled. Because I had a fighting chance. I found my niche and I stuck with it. I maxed the game on my Xbox 360, and eventually grew into PC gaming, leaving consoles behind. I only have a few minutes played on this game so far, but I had to actually back out and type this up even after the first few matches. It has been such a trip for me going through the menus and the lobby system. If you're considering buying this game for nostalgia, do it. Do it and don't take any flak that comes to you. Do it, and relive your early teens of shitty girlfriends, mountain dew, and yelling at your parents. If you've never played MW2 and are looking to see the hype, I'm afraid it's gone forever. There's a few people around on the servers, but the HYPE, the actual maxed pace heartbeat of a game that took the world by storm is gone forever and ever.

The disadvantage sadly is you'll find those people most in following game mods: Teamdeathmatch (and Hardcore as well), Free For All, Domination or Search and Destroy. Most of the other game mods like Groundwar or Capture the Flag are dead, or you'll find only 4 players who are searching for... whatever.\n\nAnd if you find a lobby? How is the gameplay in 2017?\n\nIt's okay. On the one side you have some people who played the game since it came out and dropping killstreaks one by one, on the other you have people who just playing with the easiest mechanics to play the game, playing with the overpowered grenade launcher or in everyday language Noob Tubing. \n\nBut is it playable?\n\nYes it is. You have the playertypes mentions above, but the lobby isn't full of them. There are still enough normal players around who just enjoy to play some rounds to feel the nostalic or just have some fun with friends. I've never heard someone using the voicechat, so theres no one who screams in your ear how bad you are. Just sit back, play some rounds alone or with your friends and have fun.\n\nBut what's about the hackers?\n\nYes, there are a few hackers still in MW2. But in my whole playtime I met less then 5 who hacked very \nobviously and if you're joining a hacked lobby, just quit and search for a new one.\n\nAll in all I recommend this game, when it's on sale.  I think 20\u20ac are to much, maybe 15 or 10 would be better. Also it's not a game that you can play 24/7. But some rounds on the weekend with a couple of friends, messing around in Teamdeathmatch or Search and Destroy can be very funny.", "timestamp_created": 1513882215, "timestamp_updated": 1513882215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.809262692928314209", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13053260": {"recommendationid": "13053260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017526676", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1364540400}, "language": "english", "review": "As a huge fan of Infinty Ward's Call of Duty series, I have to admit that this one, Modern Warfare 2 is my personal favourite.

The meager playtime you see is just for single-player.  I realize that this is an absurd amount of time spent on a game like this -- but if anyone's qualified to review this, it's this guy here.  Clearly, this review will be mostly multiplayer oriented.  However, I did finally check out the story mode in 2018, so here goes.\n\nHere's my impression of the single-player story: SENSORY OVERLOAD.  This game has no pacing whatsoever, in that there is literally no downtime to kind of recollect yourself.  There are explosions non-stop, motion blur and shellshock effects everywhere, enemies swarming all over the place like the story itself, and so on.  From start to finish, it is non-stop action.  The levels are mostly decent, albeit the psychic enemies with perfect aim (along with the absurd viewkick) on harder difficulties can frustrate.  The only level I truly despised was the first favela mission, as dealing with the infinite enemies was a chore.  The optimization is mostly fine, except this is a straight console port.  No FOV slider, no PC specific adjustments, etc.  This game also seems to be CPU focused, so anyone with a weaker CPU (or especially streaming on 1 PC with OBS Studio) may face challenges.  However, this game's single-player is perfect for those who just want an obscene amount of mindless action.  I dig it.\n\nThis review's focus is on the multiplayer, though, as that seems to be what most people are curious about.  And after wading through the highest of the highs MW2 offers with the lowest of the lows, there are things people should know about this game in 2018, should they consider buying it.\n\nI've played most other CoDs, and personally, this game's gunplay feels the best out of all the games in the series.  Guns shoot where you aim, even on most lag, and the player can use a lot of different guns and perk combinations while still being functional.  It really is true in this game that, \"If every gun is OP, nothing is OP.\"  There are, say, only a few guns and perks I would advise against using, although the UMP/Famas/Intervention is king.  The former is true if you're like me, and staunchly refuse to use the dirtbag One Man Army/Grenade Launcher/Danger Close exploit.\n\nThis is the perfect segway to speak about the playerbase that still plays this game.  Let's get this out of the way.  Yes, there are a lot of players that will use the noobtube nonsense 100% of the time.  Couple with that, there are quite a lot of cheaters in this game, too.  They only serve to frustrate and get reactions from others players, who are just looking to have fun.  However, fortunately, there are also a lot of players just looking to play and get a few games in for that 2009 nostalgia.  The lobbies in this game truly are run by jungle law, as Activision (unsurprisingly, since they don't even seem to care about CoD WW2) doesn't moderate cheating in MW2.  Therefore, your experience in this game will be based simply on the other players in your game.  If they're not cheating, not tubing, and the host isn't on Dollar Tree internet, this game is still fantastic online.\n\nKeep in mind -- this is a straight-up console port.  The optimization here is quite a mixed bag.  On one hand, the framerate is capped at 90fps, no FOV slider, ONE slider for audio, and so on.   However, the game does still run smooth on max settings (i7 CPU and a 1080ti), and I've only encountered a handful of crashes.  Not necessarily exclusive to console games, but just as important to mention, MW2 IS P2P-CONNECTION BASED.  This is a deal breaker for a lot of PC gamers, sometimes moreso than the 90fps cap.  If anyone is looking for a CoD with dedicated servers, MW2 isn't your game.  For others not put off by this, though, this game runs smooth enough.\n\nThe only other complaint I have is the DLC, which completely fragments the playerbase.  I truly wish Activision would do what they did with CoD4 and World at War, and package in the 10 DLC maps with the base game.  I happen to like playing the DLC maps, but the playerbase expectedly drops off significantly.  The silver lining here is that there aren't nearly as many cheaters that play in DLC lobbies, but at the expense of proportionately more noobtubers.  The dilemma here is this: do I play in regular lobbies with more players but more cheaters, or do I play in DLC lobbies with less people but less cheaters?  I ultimately have been choosing to take my chances with the regular lobbies, so I cannot recommend the DLC at this point in time.\n\nBut, really, this game is just so much fun online when everything breaks right.  MW2 comes with 16 maps in the base game (almost double what CoD WW2 gave us at launch!), tons of guns to unlock, perks to improve, classes to experiment with, and so on.  Although it's a mystery that people don't play Ground War on PC (unlike on Xbox 360, where there's usually a full lobby up), as well as some other modes, there still are many games with TDM, some Domination, and even some S&D too.  There's three conditions to having a fantastic time in MW2 multiplayer, in my opinion: no cheaters, no tubers, and no bad hosts.  Should these conditions be met, I can absolutely still recommend this game.\n\nOne disclaimer: I have not played the Spec Ops portion of this game, although I guess it's a good co-op diversion to sink some time into.  I guess.  I have no idea, so I would look elsewhere for opinions for this game mode.\n\nAlthough I really love this game, I realize that MW2 isn't for absolutely everyone.  The player may need to have the patience of a buddhist monk at times to await the right lobby to actually play the game on fair terms.  However, when that happens, MW2 is FPS nirvana online.  And if the player doesn't care about multiplayer, then their experience gets a whole lot more reliable with the over-the-top single-player story.  Either way, MW2 is a flawed classic, but it's still a classic.", "timestamp_created": 1514965074, "timestamp_updated": 1514965110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765192627906799316", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24468383": {"recommendationid": "24468383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067476350", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 1149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488614888}, "language": "english", "review": "when call of duty was worth it (full stop)", "timestamp_created": 1469226807, "timestamp_updated": 1469226807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 74, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.778159856796264648", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26353758": {"recommendationid": "26353758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042968315", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494729903}, "language": "english", "review": "You know, honestly speaking...
