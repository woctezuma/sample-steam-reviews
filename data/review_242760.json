The mechanics are not terrible.  The enemies can be pretty scary, and this game is pretty much black, when its night time in the forest. \n\nTheres a few bugs in the game, but not enough to ruin the game.

This is probably all of the good qualities.\nFrom the bad:\nMany bugs at the time of 03/03/2019, but this is not the main thing.\nAnti-cheat in this game is not, cheats are disabled only built into the game, while other players who install mods and use third-party software can easily read, spoil the impression of the game and go unpunished.\nSearch for game servers is configured disgustingly, there is no search filter for signal delay, server password, VAC protection.\nThe list of available dedicated servers is in a separate tab because of what the players do not play on them, they are too lazy to choose and search for something.\nSupporting The Forest Dedicated Server as such is absent, the developers do not respond, and the Dedicated Server itself works disgustingly, periodically loses connection with Steam because of what the players entering it do not see their buildings and other players, they see only their own inventory. This is valid until you restart the server.\nSaving the world is not compatible with each other if you transfer them from a single player to multiplayer, and even if transferred from multiplayer to Dedicated Server.\nThere are very few control commands on the Dedicated Server, and those don't work properly, for example, the restart command simply causes the server to hang. Also, when Dedicated Server is shut down, auto-save does not occur.\nDedicated Server of this game is the most disgusting with which I just came across.\n\n\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430

camp...Congrats...you've officially reached endgame), or...you end up in a cluster F multiplayer situation like rust or ark grinding out resources so that a naked zerg monkey show can roll by and wreck it while potentially kidnapping your sleeping character (while you're not even in game) so that they can keep you prisoner (to harvest your poop...because why not). But enough about those others...the Forest was a breath of fresh tree scented air.\n\nThere is decent story in the Forest for you to piece together (mostly buried in the extensive caves), and the survival elements are well done with the added gravity of an escalating cannibal threat. The way the violence tiers upward as you are on the peninsula longer and make more of an impact on the environment is pretty fun. Building is intuitive (better than it is in some big budget games) - it goes pretty fast with a friend or two, otherwise it can take a while depending on how ambitious you are.\n\nCouple of suggestions (these may seem like common sense but hey)...upgrade your bag space asap. Stick bag...rock bag. My lord they are helpful when you are trying to build anything. The sled is a huge help too. Also keep in mind that you can slide logs down zip lines if you want to build on an island or something.

You can discover lots of strange things and details. You also get a wide range of weapons and tools which are fun to mess around with. There is little customization besides making your base anyway you want. But for character customization you can change your clothing that's all but i feel like this game does not need in depth character  or weapon creation. I can't think of many downsides of The Forest, i can see how some people would think this is just another building and crafting game, well you're not wrong but what can i say it's just better than most i have played. Story wise you can just skip the story and play for the crafting and building. But it's far better than you might think, when you play The Forest for the first time it's just a big mystery you might get some clues and try to piece it together.

I like that its an open world, crafting is interesting and the cannibals running around I enjoyed, well moslty how they moved around the world and engaged with you. Felt no remorse while torturing them. However there are some things that I didnt like such as the story and the building in the game. The story to me is bad and it feels like it was made in 5 mins to give some purpose. Maybe I didnt spend enough time playing yet but I finished the game just now and im left with wtf was this. Like wtf is Timmy, whats with the stupid construction beneath the ground? Like who would make a base like that underground with narrow corridors and a huge room with glass floor for a purpose unknown. To study the freaks that they would throw below to watch them fight and bet on it or wtf. Where are the artifacts from? Since when do commercial planes crash and have survivors. Noone noticed a big island with fresh water and cannibals running around? Whats with the fucking tennis rackets everywhere. Seriously I do think this masterpiece story was written in about 5 mins or whats more likely was given to you by a pizza boy that delivered pizza to your office and told this idea to one of your game disigners while waiting for his change. But whatever maybe answers will be in the sequel. But my main disapointment was that \"the forest\" is the first game that I did not want to build anything. Maybe its a thing for multiplayer but why would you build here? Like I started the game on normal just to check it out then a few hours later changed to hard and finished it after watching some videos on you tube. In my entire playthru I didnt for a second think that I need a house here. Like what is the purpose of the house here? Games like green hell, conan exiles, the lone dark you really need a house to keep a stash and here with the rubber backpack I did not see a reason to build at all and when I tried to build I found the process to be extremly tedious. So basically building is hard and time consuming in this game and totally not needed) In any case I enjoyed the game and hope to try your future products.", "timestamp_created": 1551301880, "timestamp_updated": 1551301880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49329013": {"recommendationid": "49329013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075502888", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1541572980}, "language": "english", "review": "Actually a MegaPog\u2122 game with great gameplay mechanics coupled with a story you want to unravel.

It's a mixed bag, but nothing really stands out as 'bad'. In fact, besides a few pathfinding issues with large mutants, it's actually really good. It should be noted that I haven't completed a playthrough yet, but only because I'm a completionist and have not decided to climb down the hole yet.\n\nIn terms of the cannibals, they seem to act somewhat realistically. I play on hard mode, but...they seem to have a genuine interest in their own personal well-being. Now, I don't know exactly what attacks look like, since I built my base super strategically by hanging a bridge from the side of a cliff to a house built in the ocean, but I can describe my normal encounters on day 50+.\n\nNow, about that sense that they indeed care for their own well-being. It seems possible to intimidate the cannibals simply by not backing down, and holding your ground when they rush at you, and rushing at them back. You can do this dance of feint rushes to make them hesitant in attacking you. If you just run, they will be encouraged to attack you. If you strike out against them defensively, they will also be encouraged to attack you.\n\nBut, if you pick your targets carefully (such as only attacking the one that musters the courage to attack first of the group, or the strongest member of the group), the rest will become fearful. You can then take them down one by one until they flee. You can then flee yourself, otherwise they will come back. Or you can wait...depending if you need more bodies to burn... >:)\n\nIt's best to try a 'no-f*cks given' approach when dealing with the cannibals. I've literally kept working chopping down trees like nothing was wrong when surrounded by cannibals. Now, if they bring a fire-thrower with them, it changes the dynamic a little bit, because then the cannibals are under the misconception that ranged attacks are safer to perform than melee attacks. But if you chase them down, well, then they were wrong.\n\nIt's also possible to take a break in combat, if you've beaten the heck out of everyone. Bashed and bruised, even a large group will stop attacking if you clearly had the upper hand, and they have no more ranged members. You can just sit on a bench to recharge your stamina, and everybody can just chill for a bit. Then you finish it.\n\nBasically, it is possible to have a 'terrifying presence' in this game like Fallout, but you gain it by actual ingame ACTIONS, not stat points. It is possible to make even a large mutant run away (believe me, they're faster than they look, lol. Tried to run it down, but it just disappeared).\n\nNow, before anybody is under the false impression that the game is easy, I've played in multiplayer. My bro and I would wander off by ourselves, and be fine. But three or four of his friends sticking together? They're constantly dying. That's because they aren't playing the mind game with the cannibals. It's like they know whether you're afraid or not. And whether or not you're going to make them eat that club of theirs. Being smart is heavily rewarded in this game, and numbers aren't going to be an easy route to victory.\n\nThere is a few flaws with the AI, most notably when it comes to large mutants and caves. I mean, I suppose it's difficult for them to pathfind down there sometimes, and they aren't going to climb. Combined with what seems to be an intimidation system, you can end up with situations where a large mutant will simply stand there and stare angrily. On the other hand, there are genuinely unexpectedly 'smart' moments. Once a feral cannibal followed me home, and I turned around to see where it was hiding now. It popped its head up from behind a rock to peek at me in a humerous fashion, reminding me of a ferret or a groundhog.

This can be just a survival game as you can turn the cannibals off on the main menu, but to me the cannibals are the meat and potatoes of this game and I find myself sorely missing them should they not come visit me a couple of times a day. \n\nThe AI in this game is honestly the best I\u2019ve encountered. The game now features different types of cannibals with tribes that will fight if you watch silently, but will mostly unite in their hatred of the guy deforesting their land, (you). The cannibals will still throw a couple of punches at each other if there\u2019s enough of them around however. There are starving cannibals who will try to stalk you to find out where you live and try to scavenge off any kills you make, scouts for larger tribes who will often simply run away to alert others of your locations, hunting parties (though I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re only hunting you), and cannibals just trying to live out their lives in peace that you can finding sleeping in camps or caves. Cannibals will duck and roll to evade attacks, climb trees to escape, light tennis balls on fire and throw them at you, wreck your base if you\u2019re not careful, but they\u2019ll also do things like drop effigies which you can catch them praying at if left uninterrupted, they\u2019ll drag their wounded out of battle if they can, and will run off to retrieve others if you let them escape. \n\nBeyond the normal humanoid cannibals there are mutants who can always be found in caves, but will surface more frequently the more you piss the cannibals off. These (with the exception of the babies) are significantly tougher to kill and do a lot more damage. If they come near your base they mean business and while the spider mutant takes a couple of hits to tear anything down, I\u2019ve seen armsy rip a tree OUT OF THE GROUND and slam it into my base, destroying multiple defensive spikes and walls allowing the small army of ten or so he brought with him entrance into the base. The sumo dude doesn\u2019t even need to do anything super special to wreak havoc, if he runs at your base everything in his path will be destroyed until he stops running.\n\nHow the cannibals interact with you is highly determined by your playstyle, though I don\u2019t think they\u2019d ever be friendly with you. If you escape the plane crash quickly before they find you and are not stalked, you can have the opportunity to build a base without their knowledge if you pick a private enough location not on one of their common routes, and they generally won\u2019t find it unless you are followed home. If in contrast you do everything you can to piss them off (mass cannibal killings, mutant killings, effigy destruction and creation, burning their bodies in front of them), they will be significantly more inclined to bother you constantly. In my current single player game I see at least 4-6 spider mutants a day somewhat near my base, 1-2 armsies, and the sumo dudes have only just started coming out so luckily it\u2019s been one at a time. Even though I am absolutely plagued by mutants, I can always ghost them and move to a different part of the map. You\u2019re in control of how much you see them, which really makes the game AI feel more real and dynamic.\nMultiplayer is significantly less \u201cscary\u201d but if you wanted to build massive bases it\u2019s SOOOOOOOO much faster. It\u2019s a lot of fun playing with friends and pissing mutants off but there is some charm lost from having others about in the forest with you. In single player the fear comes from the cannibals coming out of nowhere and overwhelming you, which really doesn\u2019t happen in multiplayer. Sure when you\u2019re in the caves they\u2019ll still drop from the ceiling but when it\u2019s two against three your odds are a lot better and you know it, diluting the terror. \n\nI know this \u201creview\u201d was all over the place but the game is definitely worth full price. I mostly just wanted to mention stuff that combats all the people saying they\u2019ve never seen the mutants do much. It has the best music and you get a nice sense of accomplishment having to collect each cassette individually. \n", "timestamp_created": 1462903751, "timestamp_updated": 1462903751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 305, "votes_funny": 35, "weighted_vote_score": "0.951162159442901611", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "42618631": {"recommendationid": "42618631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032997693", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1532560660}, "language": "english", "review": "I generally hate survival games.

Chop down some trees, make a house, blah blah blah.  Jesus I was wrong.  First thing i noticed is the enemies are actually pretty terrifying.  I'd be chopping down a tree or hunting a deer and hear screeching from something that didn't even sound human anymore coming from way too close for comfort only for a mutant cannibal thing to leap out a tree at me and almost give me a heart attack.\n \nThis isn't something you ever really get used to either.  The mutants are unsettling as hell in the best way possible.  Sometimes they'll just watch you from the distance, sometimes they'll screech at you without attacking.  Even when you expect them to attack, they're stealthy as hell and almost always surprise me.  \n\nIt's also got the typical survival fanfare down to a science.  You're next upgrade is always right around the corner, but never easy to come by.  Combining that rock solid gameplay loop with terrifying enemies causes The Forest to transcend every other survival game I've ever tried.

No need to due anything story related in order to get all game content.\nRegular updates.\nBeautiful game.\nInteresting crafting system.\nYou get to kill cannibals in ever more interesting ways. (This is worth $15 alone)\nYou get to hunt animals, use skins for crafting, and mount heads on wall of your house.\nCo-op\n\nEven in it's current state, EA, I feel I've gotten more than my moneys worth out of the game. I haven't finished the game yet, but I've seen videos of people who have. I'm more interested in base building and waging war on cannibals. There isn't much of a story. Your plane crashes, kid is abducted by cannibals, you need to save him. That's all there is to it. No quests or anything like that. As you explore you find pictures drawn by kids, and photos, and empty camps that show others have been here before you. You need to put forth a good effort to piece together a story. Almost like a detective. Find the clues to explain the situation. It's there if you want it, but seems to be something the devs threw in there as an afterthought. It's well done imo though.\n\nAs for the base building. It's a bit fiddly, and takes some effort to make a really intricate base. The system of base building allows you to build very complex bases though. Which is great for when you get a large group of cannibals attacking your base you can make all kinds of fun ways to trap or funnel them into choke points for maximum cannibal crushing carnage. After every update all the trees you've cut down will respawn. So getting a bunch of trees suddenly appearing right through the middle of your house is a possibility. Make sure you build your base around the trees you've cut down, just leave the stumps and build around them. Cutting the trees that are growing through structures will destroy the structure.\n\nThe crafting system is fun imo. No crazy animations or wait times for making rope, molotovs, axes, spears, etc. Just open the inventory and start combining ingredients. Certain herbs can be combined to restore health/stam. Combine 2 deer skin with rope and cloth to make a waterskin. Feathers and sticks to make arrows. Add cloth and booze to arrows to make fire arrows. A watch+coins+booze+circuit board to make a bomb. Add sap for a sticky bomb. Pretty simple. Once you add an item to the crafting mat in the inventory (just right click something to add it to the crafting mat, no clicking and dragging nonsense), a stick for example, a list appears telling you every item you can make using a stick. A bow, spear, upgraded spear, snowshoes, arrows, club, etc. It doesn't tell you which ingredients, or how many you will need to make each item though. So trial and error, or google, is needed. It's kinda fun. Almost like a mini game.\n\nNo voice acting, hand holding, tutorial (besides a very simplistic manual that explains the very basics), or anything like that. As soon as you wake up in the crashed plane you have the freedom to do whatever it is you want. No time constraints or anything like that. This is what i love about the game! Nothing is worse than having a 30 minute opening tutorial to explain that you have to eat/sleep/drink in order to survive. Also, no stupid plot points that open up more content. Like doing a certain part of the story in order to craft fire arrows or whatever.\n\nThe game is still being worked on with regular updates. Bug fixes and more content, like craftable/findable items, come every 15 days I think it is. Something like that. There are a few items that have no use. Snowshoes for example. I would imagine that you will need them in the snow areas, but in the games current state they aren't needed at all. I see this as a good thing. It means there's alot more tweaking and game mechanics to be implemented.\n\nThere is co-op but I've never played it. Therefore, I will leave this out of the review. Plenty of other reviews cover this subject I'm sure.\n\nAt the end of the day, it all comes down to if it's worth the money or not. In it's current state, I have gotten my moneys worth of enjoyment out of the game many times over.

This can be just a survival game as you can turn the cannibals off on the main menu, but to me the cannibals are the meat and potatoes of this game and I find myself sorely missing them should they not come visit me a couple of times a day. \n\nThe AI in this game is honestly the best I\u2019ve encountered. The game now features different types of cannibals with tribes that will fight if you watch silently, but will mostly unite in their hatred of the guy deforesting their land, (you). The cannibals will still throw a couple of punches at each other if there\u2019s enough of them around however. There are starving cannibals who will try to stalk you to find out where you live and try to scavenge off any kills you make, scouts for larger tribes who will often simply run away to alert others of your locations, hunting parties (though I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re only hunting you), and cannibals just trying to live out their lives in peace that you can finding sleeping in camps or caves. Cannibals will duck and roll to evade attacks, climb trees to escape, light tennis balls on fire and throw them at you, wreck your base if you\u2019re not careful, but they\u2019ll also do things like drop effigies which you can catch them praying at if left uninterrupted, they\u2019ll drag their wounded out of battle if they can, and will run off to retrieve others if you let them escape. \n\nBeyond the normal humanoid cannibals there are mutants who can always be found in caves, but will surface more frequently the more you \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 the cannibals off. These (with the exception of the babies) are significantly tougher to kill and do a lot more damage. If they come near your base they mean business and while the spider mutant takes a couple of hits to tear anything down, I\u2019ve seen armsy rip a tree OUT OF THE GROUND and slam it into my base, destroying multiple defensive spikes and walls allowing the small army of ten or so he brought with him entrance into the base. The sumo dude doesn\u2019t even need to do anything super special to wreak havoc, if he runs at your base everything in his path will be destroyed until he stops running.\n\nHow the cannibals interact with you is highly determined by your playstyle, though I don\u2019t think they\u2019d ever be friendly with you. If you escape the plane crash quickly before they find you and are not stalked, you can have the opportunity to build a base without their knowledge if you pick a private enough location not on one of their common routes, and they generally won\u2019t find it unless you are followed home. If in contrast you do everything you can to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 them off (mass cannibal killings, mutant killings, effigy destruction and creation, burning their bodies in front of them), they will be significantly more inclined to bother you constantly. In my current single player game I see at least 4-6 spider mutants a day somewhat near my base, 1-2 armsies, and the sumo dudes have only just started coming out so luckily it\u2019s been one at a time. Even though I am absolutely plagued by mutants, I can always ghost them and move to a different part of the map. You\u2019re in control of how much you see them, which really makes the game AI feel more real and dynamic.\nMultiplayer is significantly less \u201cscary\u201d but if you wanted to build massive bases it\u2019s SOOOOOOOO much faster. It\u2019s a lot of fun playing with friends and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 mutants off but there is some charm lost from having others about in the forest with you. In single player the fear comes from the cannibals coming out of nowhere and overwhelming you, which really doesn\u2019t happen in multiplayer. Sure when you\u2019re in the caves they\u2019ll still drop from the ceiling but when it\u2019s two against three your odds are a lot better and you know it, diluting the terror. \n\nI know this \u201creview\u201d was all over the place but the game is definitely worth full price. I mostly just wanted to mention stuff that combats all the people saying they\u2019ve never seen the mutants do much.

Now, I don't usually like horror games/films/anything scary because I get minor heart attacks if someone as much as speaks or claps suddenly. That being said, my husband bought this game and I watched him play it. I was scared to death, but the more I watched the more I just couldn't keep my fingers off of it!\n\nBut to the point. Here are some pros and cons, but keep in mind that it is an alpha game.\n\nPros:\n- Stunning graphics and environment. I was absolutely blown away, and I still am.\n- Very real environment with wildlife offering food and crafting materials, nice weather and sound effects and more.\n- The cannibals are an amazing and unique enemy. A breath of fresh air from zombies (which I am not very fond of). They are clever and tactical as well as primitive, and I am completely terrified of them! They have very smooth, elegant and agile movements, and they can be very sneaky. Watch your back while chopping wood for your constructions!\n- While the environment is beautiful, you constantly feel tense and threatened by your sorroundings, whether it's movement in the distance, a shadow, a rustling of leaves or other sounds.\n- The crafting system is lovely. You can spend a lot of time creating a nice base, and the crafting possibilities are ever improving with new content being added. Custom building can be slightly buggy, but I'm sure they will fix it and add to it.\n- The game has a creative mode. I've seen a few people requesting this, probably not knowing that it already exists. At the start screen, simply type \"veganmode\" and you will not see any cannibals at all. This allows you to just enjoy yourself in peace if you feel like surviving and building. You may also type \"vegetarianmode\", if you wish for the cannibals to only be out at night, giving you a breathing space during the day. This is very lovely.\n- The co-op version is a bunch of fun. It's a great experience to share with your friends - although you must beware that the co-op version is currently very buggy and laggy.\n- Last but not least it really feels like the developers want to make this a top notch game for the final release. They regularly fix bugs while also adding new content like crafting and new places to explore.\n\nCons:\n- I mentioned the co-op in pros, but as I also briefly said, it is very very buggy and laggy. Hopefully they will fix it, which I feel confident that they will. Also, you should note that there are currently saving problems with co-op. The host can save the game while in multiplayer, but your co-player won't be able to join the game again after quitting. The host can continue the game in solo mode, but not with friends. This is a shame. I very much hope they will fix this soon. [EDIT: I just managed to re-join a game that my husband had hosted earlier, so maybe it is possible. However, I started back in the airplane each time I rejoined. Either way, I'm sure all of this will be smoothed out eventually.]\n- Buggy, glitchy, blah blah. It's alpha, it's to be expected. I don't think there are any game breaking bugs or glitches, though. If something is bugged, I haven't experienced not being able to fix it with a quick reload of the game.\n- Currently you might be running out of content a little quickly. I believe they are working on making more content for the game. The boy from the plane who I believe must be the survivor's son is not currently to be found anywhere as far as I can tell from what I've seen and read. I would think they are working on making it a goal to find and rescue him from the cannibals, which would give the game some more sense of purpose. For now, it's just, scavenge, build, eat, drink, fight - survive. But I enjoy that :)\n- The map is the same everytime you start a new game (although you crash in different places, and I think some cannibal buildings also are in different places). I don't necessarily dislike this, even though a new world every time would make exploring all the more exciting. However, I do hope that they make the map quite a bit bigger. If they don't you end up knowing the entire island in and out quite quickly, and then there won't be much exploring left to do. Making the island itself bigger would work, but making more islands to explore using your raft or whatever would be even more awesome. I have high hopes, but we'll see what the devs have in store for us. :)\n- While the developers seem to be doing a magnificent job with regular updates, the game still seems to be far off beta. I am not sure how long we will have to wait. However long it is, though, I am completely sure that the end result will be breathtaking in every aspect. Keep up the good work, devs, you are doing so well!\n\nI don't know if I covered everything, but this is all I can think of for now. I may update my review as more additions are made to the game. Overall, The Forest is a keeper. 10/10 shining stars from me despite the bugs and what not. I would highly recommend anyone who like survival/sandbox/horror games to buy this game - also during early access. The devs are clearly putting the money to good use, so I feel good about having offered them some support at this early stage. In fact, I was very surprised at how cheap it is.

With that being said, i'd like to list the pros and cons of the game\n\n[b]PROS:[/b]\n-Open world sandbox survival done right\n\nWhen I first got this game, I thought it would just be another one of those build a castle and live forever kind of games. I was wrong, thankfully. In The Forest, you can build incredible structures, but the enemies make your life difficult regardless of how good your defenses are. Want to eat but your food reserves are low? Too bad! There's a raiding party of 6 cannibals outside yelling at you about your destruction of the environment. The more you cut down trees and kil cannibals, the more enemies will come for you. It's like the EPA, but they're pissed off and want to eat you. The cannibals will hound you day and night, and they're crafty little things. They will gang up on you from all sides. Just when you thnk they've left and it's safe to kill that lizard that's been running from you for a week, they come out of nowhere and start beating you down.\n\n-The story is actually amazing\n\nYou'd think that they would just make occasional tweaks to the AI to make them better at killing you, and that's it. But nope, the developers of The Forest actually made a compelling and interesting story (and it makes sense!). There's bits of lore to find everywhere. From caves, to boats, and sometimes just on the ground in select places. The game offers lots of foreshadowing and clues to what is really going on there. The games ending is just great as well. It answers damn near all the questions that I had asked about the game, but you know what the awesome part is? The ending is not an easy thing to get to! Why is that? Well I'll address it in my next point.\n\n-Caves\n\nI have a love hate relationship with caves. Caves are always scary, and it doesn't matter how much I've explored them. I STILL get spooked when I go into a cave I know I've cleared in search of some cans of coke and some TNT. There's an eerie feeling about the caves, because they're not just caves; they're breeding grounds and bases for the cannibals. There's noises that you think are cannibles breating, when in reality it's just sounds from the cave itself. Creaking, rocks falling, the occasional maniacle laughter. Oh wait that one is the cannibals, who are likely pissed that you're invading their home. These caves are also pitch black, did I mention that? you need to bring a torch, or 12. I mean, you really shouldn't go exploring in caves in anything less than full bone armor and the Katana or Modern Axe. Nah just kidding. You can explore them with only a lighter and your prayers, and you'll probably get eaten just the same. You know what really sucks though? All the best gear (and gear you need to beat the game) is located in the various cave systems.\n\n-Co-op mode\nCo-op is actually really good. You would expect it to be a glitchy, buggy mess (it's mostly not). The game is still terrifying and immersive, but now you're able to play it with friends! The scaries part of co-op isn't the cannibals though. It's guarding your food from your friend with the appetite of an elephant and the hunting skills of a quadriplegic.\n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n\n-The AI seems to have very poor problem solving skills at times\n\nWhile smacking the occasional turtle and using his remains to collect water, some cannibals might show up to fight you. This isn't a problem when you have traps though! You know what is a problem? The cannibals seem to have the deductive reasoning abilities of a brain dead alpaca when faced with traps. GRR GRR and BLEAT BLEAT will run head first into a trap while RAWR RAWR stays behind and watches his two friends get impaled. He then decides that it's an amazing idea to do THE SAME THING that they just did. It's not as bad now as it used to be in prior patches, but they still do stupid stuff like this.\n\n-Weird ropes sometimes cause death falls\n\nSometimes when using climbing ropes, the game decides that you'd like to take a 5 story fall into a cave with a Virginia and her babies. It doesn't happen often, and has only affected me in Co-op games thus far, but it's still a massive pain in the ass (or legs, as it were).\n\n\n\nI don't have anything else major that comes to mind. The Forest is an excellent game that, in my opinion, is an absolute steal at $15. This game gets a 9/10 from me. I took off a point because of the annoying bugs and glitches that occasionally happen. It is almost perfect, but missed the margin of perfection by just a hair. If you don't yet own the game, I would encourage you to get it.

Nothing more romantic than strolling down a sunset beach being chased by a bunch of naked cannibals. Makes you feel like a celebrity.\n\nDepending on your nature I would suggest, if you are patient: You don't mind set backs,and have a good sense of humour. Get it now. It's pretty awesome even with all the flaws. Regular updates mean you're generally not stuck too long with one issue.. of course with each update you'll generally stumble upon something else to perplex you.. think of it as hurdles.. But everything looks pretty so that's okay.\n \nIf you don't enjoy being murdered by flying tables, eaten by land sharks, dislike leviatating geese, backwards rabbits and other such oddities then I suggest you wait it out till the game is more developed.\n\n\nThe Forest:\n\nDay 1: I awaken from my inflight nap to find this creepy looking kid clinging to my arm.. I knew I should of paid extra for busniess class. I look around the otherwise empty plane. Where the fuck is my inflight meal and booze? there's a little turbulance and next thing we are minus half a plane and going down. Lol that kid isn't wearing his safety belt. He's screwed. We crash and I black out.\n\nI awaken once again, to a near naked oiled up man-thing scooping up the unconsious child, this upsets me somewhat because now I have no one to offer as a peace sacrifice to the natives. After he runs off into the bushes with the kid I yell \"SHOULD OF WORN YOUR SAFETY BELT YOU LITTLE SHIT\" I help myself to numerous trays of inflight meals and booze glorious booze that due to some miracle survived the plane crash and are still sitting neatly on seats and shelves. I pick up random pill bottles and devour the contents and collect a pedometer from a foot, how ironic. Lucky for me, I am a paranoid survival enthusiast and was wearing my outdoor back pack complete with survival guide in preparation for this very event. \n\nExiting the half a plane, grabbing a conviently placed fire axe fitted snuggly in that slack flight attendants chest, I raid a few luggage cases of the non existant passengers, mmm sexy panties. Wandering the beach at sunset, alchohol lines the beaches, natures natural drink cooler and notice a group of nudists. Fuck yes. This island is awesome. I run up to them waving my drink in greeting. The god of Tits and wine has blessed this place!! They stare at me like I am some kind of freak, probably because I'm wearing clothes and this has obviously offended thier religon because the nearest native attempts to claw my eyejellies out, shocked I hi 5 him in the face with my axe and the natives flee, shiny butts bouncing in the sunlight. \n\nI keep moving, being the survivalist I am I slaughter a few fluffy bunnies and a lizard, skin them and find a nice spot to set up for the night. I start a fire with my trusty everlasting lighter. Thank goodness they kindly let me bring my lighter aboard the plane! I build a small shelter out of sticks and cook myself a lizard, you can just taste the intestinal parasites! \n\nDay 2-4:\n\nNot only am I a paranoid survival enthusiast. But I'm also an architect and master of construction! I have found a nice spot to start my new life here on this island, no point trying the planes radio, salvaging and rebuilding the yatch or boats I spotted on the beach or any of that shit.\nI have lashed together some sticks to form a sturdy log sled! I have about 6 logs stacked ontop of the tiny twigs and another 2 logs carried by myself, with one arm. I push the sled along with the mere power of my pinky toe thankful for my Russian hertiage. I build myself a snazzy tree house because daddy issues meant I never had one as a child. I stash my porn in it along with the panties I salvaged from the wreck. I've got 4 walls, a drying rack, a fire, storage facilaties for my supplies, a freaking gazebo and a bunch of death traps surrounding my walls for those pesky natives, who despite the abundance of wildlife and edible plants, have opted for human flesh instead... Gotta hand it to them though, they have some really inspiring art peices, the man shoved through his own tennis rackets and every orifice crammed with tennis balls is my favourite, brings me to tears every time I see it. If I was going to make any effort whatsoever to return to human civilization, I'd totally steal some of thier work and sell it for millions. I've been working on my own style using the cannibals body parts, my centrepeice being 'head on a stick' I just can't seem to capture the same passions though.\n\nDay 5:\n\nWalls seem to be a weakness to the cannibals, they are in awe of them as they repeatedly ram thier faces into it, and growl at it. Small minded barbarians hahah.\n\nIt's not so funny when they walk through my wall... the sole source of my security.. but it's funny again when they walk into my campfire and burn to death. My emotional roller coaster of fun and fear may have something to do with my wandering through the forest earlier eating shrooms.\non my return to camp I accidentally walked into a fire, and caught fire to myself. In the rain. Adeles song has so much more meaning to me now. \n\n*TO BE CONTINUED*", "timestamp_created": 1412999368, "timestamp_updated": 1414198686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 445, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.944632112979888916", "comment_count": 30, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32811063": {"recommendationid": "32811063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170411697", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508707632}, "language": "english", "review": "So I am trying to introduce my wife to the gaming world.

Great Dev support as well.\n\n======\n\nI woke in a broken plane, only to scavange what was left because I was hungry and hurt. Popped a few pills and jumped out of the plane's hull before seeing scattered suitcases everywhere. Each one of them seemed locked, but my trusty axe I found made quick work of them. Found tennis balls in a few, didn't know Roger Federer was onboard. Must of been in first class. \n\nBeing the Natural hunter I was, I beat Lizards and a few bunnies to death with a makeshift club I wrapped in cloth. Skinned them and saved their meat for later. Slapping the freshly carved Lizard's skin on like armor as a sick man I am, I continued to kill its bretheren until I was covered with their protective armor. I dipped myself in a fresh found pool of water near a large tree I couldn't cut. Oddly, I found a makeshift spear inside. Mine. Totally took that shit. And then I was met with a shriek off in the distance. Wolfs? Cyotes? Roise O'Donald? Either way, I was scared shitless as night started to fall.\n\nFast forward a day, after finding a large cliff side with one walkway from behind me for anything to sneak up, so I decide to build a defensive wall to close it off. I take to the nearby forest with a newly made log sled to transport trees back to my new base. A fire pit and Hunters shelter is made. I stow away rocks and sticks I have in excess there incase I need to build anything else. I light up the fire pit and cook a bunny on it, eating it before I huddled up in my shelter for the night. \n\nI woke in the night, only to be met with two sets of beady eyes glistening across my fire pit in the darkness. I pull my axe out in hand, hearing them hiss. Humans? They looked the part, but said nothing to me. One cries out as it dashes for me, I raise the axe and block his advance. I chop the axe into this crazed man, beating him back a few times until he fell to the ground. His friend hissed at me and ran on all fours away into the woods. What the fuck did I just kill, Smeagol? \n\nFast forward about three more days, I have my rear and front defensive walls built out from the steep cliff side to the oceans waters, only one way in. Its safter to light fires at night now and sleep, since the locals seem afraid of this place. I set out on foot, spear in hand and covered in mud and deer hides to keep me warm. I had to find their village. After evading a few patrols of the locals, I stumbled into three huts and what looks like to be a large den. Looking into said den after ghosting around the town to make sure no one is there, I enter to only find a noose to greet me. And another man hanging. I cut the rope to use to my gains. I quickly pull a stick together with cloth and rope to make me a shortbow. And all those fucking feathers, now into arrows. Seriously, I had about two hundred of them. Making a few I test fire the bow. We're good to go. The srieks come back in the distance, I bolt back home. \n\nDay... I don't even know. Sun has come and gone so many times now. Traps lingering in the forest just ouside. Effigies planted about fifty yards out from the front of my gates, only to be mimicked the same way by the locals across the way. They want to show their territory. I disobey. Covered in my lizard armor and deer pelts, I stalk upon a patrol not far from my home. I wait until two break off from the group, while I keep my watchful eye on them from the hilltop bushes. Bow in my hand. The two stop near a pool. I pull tension on my bows string, lining up a shot. Release. Arrow pegs the local in the head and drops. His friend panics, only to be met with me, silently springing from the bushes with spear. His limp body drops into the pool of water. I make effigies of their corpses. \n\nWar rages on and I begin hunting at night. Traps litter segments around the forest closest to my home. I draw them out of hiding with a simple fire. I wait. I watch. They come. Throwing a rock their way grabs their attention, turning towards me. I shoot a arrow at the leader of this five man pack. All hell breaks loose. I slink my way down hill side in the darkness, as they follow close behind. I slip past two traps. One of the locals gets hung up in my noose trap, as two more grouped together and get impaled on my spike trap. Leader and croney is left. I peg the leader two more times with arrows until he drops. Small one begins to run. I draw my bow, having a clear shot. I don't take the shot. I let him run. Let him tell the others that I will not be hunted so easily. \n\nIn this forest, you either die as the hunted, or you live long enough to see yourself become the hunter.\n\n10/10 - Would Crash Again. \n\n---------------------------------------\n\n(( Serious number: 9/10 )) Game is in /alpha/ and already this intense.

Now that the game is released I\u2019m coming back for a review. \n\nThis is quite possibly one of the most underrated games on Steam. The Forest is what every online survival game should aspire to be. Being a single player/co op game gives it some advantages however. \n\nGraphics-9/10\nThe world is vast and beautiful in its own way. Character models are outstanding. Cannibals look creepy as f*ck. The trees blow in the wind, the waves move separate from your character so it gives you the feeling of actually swimming in dangerous waters. It\u2019s by no means next gen, but being a game that released years ago in EA it\u2019s still one of the more fantastic looking games on Steam.\n\nAtmosphere-10/10\nThere\u2019s nothing I can really say untill you try the game yourself. The Wilderness feels lonely, cold. The cannibal caves are incredibly scary. Each little abandoned camp you find in the wilderness has its own eerie sense of dread. Villages looked like they were/are lived in. This is quite possibly the highlight of the game. The environment in the Forest is expertley crafted.\n\nGameplay-8/10\nCombat at the start of the game is great. Melee has weight to it. Bows feel nice to shoot. As the game progresses Combat Can get repetitive. You\u2019ll end up killing boatloads of Cannibals and after the first 10 days or so you\u2019ll start to get a little bored. Luckily building is not only balanced but deep. You don\u2019t have a ton of different materials to work with so the building is limited in variety but The Forest gives you all the tools you need to create your camp. Want a big fortress with arrow towers? You can build it. Want a small hunting camp that allows you to stay on the move constantly? You can build that. Want a sweet boat house that allows you to travel the shores of the island? You can build that. Want a quaint log cabin that reminds you of the old country? You can build it. \n\nThe game gets more challenging as time goes on and depending on the way you\u2019ll play you\u2019ll either be taking on Armors of Cannibals or sneaking around them. Stealth is as important as combat and works well enough. \n\nThere\u2019s lots to explore, caves, landmarks, boats, lakes, mountains. In a seemingly empty Forest the devs have managed to cram a lot of content in. \n\nThe crafting is really where the game shines. You can craft anything from primitive spears to sticky bombs. Bone Armor to stealth armor, clubs, axes, herbal medicines, tools. The crafting is exceptionally deep. I\u2019m about 40 hours in and there\u2019s still things I\u2019ve yet to craft I\u2019m sure. \n\nIt\u2019s also worth stating that the AI is good. Very good. My first ever experience with a cannibal saw us in a standoff. She was just watching me, I went up to her and immediately noticed something was wrong with her. I took out my axe and I lunges toward here. She ran away and came back with friends. They circled me for a while before I took a swig at the leader and they ran off scared again. It\u2019s the first time a game has ever made me feel like the AI was reacting to my character. Even if they really weren\u2019t. The AI will get more full as you progress through the game but the initial encounters made for some great gameplay moments.\n\nSurvival-8/10\nThis IS a survival game. You\u2019ll battle the elements, hunger and thirst and your own sanity. Pretty standard for survival games but The Forest does it in a way where it feels fun. Rates are balanced, and creating your own sustenance is both easy and challenging. I don\u2019t think there ever was a time where I felt like the survival aspect was crushing my experience.  You\u2019ll scavenge for supplies from the plane but those will eventually run out. Its at that point where you\u2019ll have to start crafting your own medicines and hunting for your own food and water.\n\nSound-10/10\nOnce again this lends itself to the atmosphere. Cannibals sound scary, nature sounds beautiful, and events have their own ominous music to accompany them.\n\nStory-9/10\nEverything seems pretty straight forward untill you get towards the end of the game. I won\u2019t spoil it but the story was fantastic. \n\nThe Forest-9/10\nBetween Co-Op and peaceful modes you\u2019ll never run out of things to do. The Forest combines a spectacular atmosphere with engaging gameplay to provide one of the best survival experiences you can ever have.\n", "timestamp_created": 1537810956, "timestamp_updated": 1537810956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 143, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.909954607486724854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20578495": {"recommendationid": "20578495", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115327996", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 11150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550372063}, "language": "english", "review": "How many people have you seen in the review section with 100 hours?

There is very little snapping, and that is somehing I like.\n-I know it was added forever ago, but multiplayer was probaly the most beneficial thing to this game. Ever.\n-It's fifteen f*cking dollars! FOR ALL OF THIS!?\n-Still in alpha stages, so more could be added. (Though I have played more hours of this than there are hours of Dishonored's campaign, so its already worth my money.)\n-Great community, unless you join a game with a five-year-old who says, \"Your in big trouble,\" and kicks you from game. That legitimately happened before I wrote this review. Srsly. Give me a reason.\n-Multitude of collectable items.\n-Interesting lore, or so I think. There is no wiki page, so you have to explore and find all the burial sites and photos to figure it out yourself. I could be way wrong. Look at the end of this review for my personal opnion on the story.\n-Devs are fantabulous. Thats not a word.\n\nCons\n-It is in alpha, so there is more to be desired.\n-When running The Forest on PotatOS 6.7 [Like that pun :3= ?] and you have it in low res mode, it is so pixelated, my friend thought that a tennis ball was a lemon, and proudly proclaimed, \"This is my lemon!\"\n-Feels a but empty once you have gotten to the sinkhole. So don't rush to get in there.\n-The inventory system is set up so you can carry a certain amount of a certain item. It is always the same. The katana goes to the upper-left, the rebreather next to it, you can only carry 5 dynamite, ect. The downside in this I find is the lack of inventory management. It might just be me, but I relish in the orginazational pleasure of shifting item around in my inventory to make room for new ones. Maybe it is just me and I'm a weirdo, but it's a con for me so it's on the list.\n-Want an axe for a weapon! No... well, tough luck. Katana is a bit later game so...\n-I like a heavy focus on the range of items and fauna to be found in a game. The game is doing better, but my soul is a void, so keep adding to fill it devs :3=\n\nLore- The sinkhole is called a cetone` in the patch notes, which is a Mayan word for abyss. These cetone`s formed in the yucatun peninsula in Mexico. This said, the area is not an island, but is blocked of by a mountainous region, indicating it is the southern yucatan peninsula. The compass points north to the mountains, so it must take place in the southern region of Guatamala. The Cetone`s were worshiped by the Mayans. This must mean that the massive Cetone` in the middle of the map was a hub of mayan civilization, as the cetone` there is many times bigger than any one in our knowledge, as they are generally only 30 feet deep. Perhaps a strange a race had hid in these caves and slowly mutated over time to adapt to cannibalistic dietary habits. As the Mayans discovered the place, they also discovered its unruly inhabitants. Perhaps that was why the Mayans disappeared. As memory faded of the hellish place, the sinkhole was rediscovered and put on the front pages of caving magazines worldwide. As you explore, you can see evidence of early 20th century spelunking equipment. After the explorers never returned, the incident was forgotten, and became a sort of \nbermuda triangle. In 1982, a family went on a boat trip to explore the region. They lost thier son and looked for him. It is assumed he was eaten. The grave near the yacht may show that one of the parents died by starvation. The final parent is gone without trace. The several campgrounds indicate people who explored the region, not believing the rumors of cannibals. A film crew's camp can also be found by Goose Lake. James Blanc (you) and Timmy Blanc (your relative) crash in the forest. The Virginias, or six-legged female mutants, are the only cannibals with genitalia, indicated that the malformed cannibal babies surrounding them are its offspring.\n\nLike this review so others can see and revise my theories.

This goes for most games that belong to the horror genre. The Forest, however, is different. You can go the whole game without encountering any of the mutants and cannibals if you play your cards right. It's only when you let your guard down that you get fucked over. Nothing makes you shit your pants quite like seeing the silhouette of a hunting party sprinting across a hill in the distance. I've woken up some mornings and really don't want to leave the safety of my tree house. No other game has given me that gut-wrenching feeling as to date. I feel as if i'm fucking playing Minecraft PvP all of again; holding down \"sneak\" for dear life and as not to get spotted. The AI in this game is fantastic. The cannibals will leave you alone for the first few days, watching your every move. As the game progresses they get more and more ballsy. The AI will test you to see how you respond. If you act fearful and run away they will see you as prey and you'll end up with more raiding parties visiting you. However, If you act aggresive then they will retreat only to return with an army that, no matter how powerful you are, you just wont be able to match. Staying neutral with the tribesmen requires maintaining eye contact, holding your ground and showing your strength. Gaining respect from the natives is crucial to your survival. I do have to poke some fun at the audio though. Whilst the atmospheric sounds are fucking on point, certain noises are just all over the fucking place. For example, when fighting a single cannibal it can sound like there are 3 more behind you when in reality there's not. Beating a native to a pulp is incredibly disorientating when screams from the same cannibal move from your left ear to your right ear even though the tribesman hasn't moved. Certain water sounds are also unbearably loud when compared to other ambient effects. Obviously the game is still in alpha and these issues will surely be resolved, but the game already feels incredibly polished already; I've yet to experience any sort of game-breaking bug.\n\nI've not played a game that made me giddy inside for quite a while.

I have been playing The Forest almost from the beginning.  I began by watching Kage848 and GameEdged.  Those two got me interested in the game in the first place. \n\nThe First Night.\nI built a small wall against a cliff with an opening covered by a standing fire, which saved my life as it didnt take long for the natives to find me....and they will find you.  The fire proved to be a good way to keep them at bay, but gods was it terrifying.  \nMy first encounter, as I was running around the opening of my wall, was a dirty, hideous woman screaming in my face.  She struck at me once and I retreated up the cliff face, nearly falling to my death several times. All the while I could see the woman below me, running around on all fours screeching an awful noise, which attracted more of them.  As I reached the midway point of the cliff face, looking down, I could see several figures approaching through the trees in the pale moonlight.  One seemed to have a flashlight of some sort above his head.  The others noticed me atop the cliff and hooted and hollered most of the rest of the night, leaving me just before dawn as I was able to complete the climb up the cliff, and disappear out of view.  \n\nA few days passed before I had another encounter, this time I thought I was ready.  I had built several traps atop my cliff, which was surrounded on 3 sides by a sheer face.  The top of the cliff had a quaint little pond with several gleaming fish slowly swimming around their isolated home which fed me, along with the squirrels and rabbits for a few days.  Many trees dotted the edge of one side of the escarpment , while the other side was bare, giving me a beautiful view of the turbulent ocean below, which turned out to be my only escape....\n\nI awoke one morning to a bleak and rainy day, the fires of my torch would not stay lit, and I was cold.  I managed to craft some rabbit skin boots which aided slightly in warming my blue, shivering body. As the day wore on and the night creeped in, I crafted a decent fire, which I refused to use in the beginning for the fear of attracting more of the monstrosites which chased me to the top of this cliff.  As I looked off in the distance, over the rolling hills of the accessible side of my little moutain camp, I could make out several shapes heading my way. The night was approaching quickly and I could barely make out the group which was dead set on my camp. One appeared to be much taller than the rest, and the smaller ones were scurrying around the hulking figure very quickly, and with reckless abandon.  As they came closer I could see that the figure in the middle was not a man....but a woman.  I could barely make out 6 legs before the monster reared up and began to charge my way, with demonic speed and an intent to flay me alive. I had only a stone axe, and the plane axe in which I found after the devastating crash. I knew I was in trouble, and as I fought bravely, the group was too much. I turned and ran off the edge of the cliff, jumping for dear life into the ocean below....The screeches of the ugly monsters trailed closely after me as I plummeted into the icy depths of the waters that imprisoned me here.  Sadly I did not reach deep enough water, and the fall slammed me into unconscienceness.  \n\nI briefly awoke being dragged through the forest by two tribal looking men.  Each had one of my wrists, and I could hardly make out what they looked like underneath the canopy of trees.  Unconscienceness creeped over me again, and I succumbed to the fading of my vision.\n\nWhen I awoke for the second time, I could not see anything. I could hear the twisted echoes of screams all around me, off in the distance.  So far but seeming so close.  I pulled out my lighter which took a while to spark.  As the small sparks caught with fuel and the flame burst forth illuminating my body and surroundings, I realized I was hanging from a ceiling inside a cave.  As I looked around I could see the fleshy chunks of my plane comrades.  Bloody skulls littered the floor and here and there an arm or leg protuded from a giant pile of flesh and bile.  I noticed my plane axe was on the floor just below me, I reached for it and cut my bindings.  I fell with a hard thud to the cave floor and my lighter went out.  It would not ignite again.  I noticed a dim light off in the distance and began to head towards it, all the while not noticing the dangling rope behind me that would lead me out of this hellish underworld.  Venturing further and further down, the rope faded from view, and the screams echoed louder.....and louder.\n\nSo if this sounds cool, and you have the chance to play The Forest blind, buy this game.  You will not be disappointed. Thank you to all the developers for making such an amazing, terrifying, wonderful game.

I had build a simple shelter, had a decent supply of food and had crafted a simple spear. I decided it was time for some exploring, and I ventured downhill to try and find out where I had landed anyways. Soon I came to a beach, a bio I hadn't explored before. And what do you know, as soon as I arrive three sea turtles turn up in my sight. I got super excited, because I was running out of fresh water to drink. In my survival book I'd seen I could build a raincatcher from a turtle shell, and I desperately needed one. Even before the majestic creatures had fully come to land I jump ontop of one and use my axe to brutally decapitate it in one swing. As I tear open its shell with my bare hands I gather what flesh I can to eat later, and without a second thought I murder the others as well. I'd been living on squirrel for days, so this was a real treat. I noticed I could carry only one shield at the time, so I grabbed the nearest one and ran back to my base to set up my first raincatcher. As I came back to the beach to collect the other shields I suddenly notice two of the canibals standing over the corpses of the turtles I just killed. [b]MY TURTLES![/b] I grab my spear, and run down the beach yelling. As the woman looks up and is suprised by our first contact I launch my spear in her chest before she can even react. With my axe I bash her fase in, sending her teeth flying through the air. As she drops dead I take my spear and covered in her blood I turn to the other guy simply staring him down. It takes a couple of seconds but then decides to turn around and run away yelling. Good, I think to myself. Let him tell the others nobody touches my turtles.\n\n10/10 would turn primal again. \n\n\nWhen I fist saw the video's I though the game was some kind of base building with waves of enemies coming at you stronger and stronger. I was pleasantly suprised that there's so much more depth to it than that. The game allows you to set up camp anywhere you want, multiple even, if it helps. You can stay away from the canibals, stalking them and learning their patterns. The game rewards you for memorizing which plants grow where, where which animals tend to live and which routes the canibals take. It's a survival where you need to upkeep your food and water supply from the wild, build shelters to stay dry and warm, and find the right ingredients to build your tools. Though they will be attracted by your campfire, the canibals on the surface are actually not your biggest problem. The true horror of the game sets in when you feel prepared enough to go explore the network of caves underground. So dark, so quiet, and so many corpses. The game never tells you what to do, it's completely up to you what you want to explore or try out. If you think the game gets boring all you have to do is venture further from your place of comfort and there's all kinds of places and items to find. Fighting the canibals is tough at first, but it gets kinda satisfying as you get stronger and are able to take on 3 or 4 of them at the time, gather their dead bodyparts and put them on a spike to warn the others. They have an interesting mechanic where you can actually scare them off, and they become noticably more cautious. \n\nThings feel rewarding. You have a proper spear, have learned to hunt the wild, recognize plants and herbs. You have explored the lands and carry half a week worth of dried meat under your self made hide clothes.

The core concept and execution of the game are excellent thus far. The Developers for this game are very active in the community and regularly release updates. Detailed breakdown:\n\nWhat we know about the Story:\n\nThe story is in development. This means the whole Story is not there. You cannot \"beat\" the game as is. While exploring the island you will find clues as to what happened to \"Timmy\" (who is assumed to be your son). Parts of his toy, pictures, cave sketches. The game has basically zero handholding and refuses to point you in any direction at all. Most people will never find all the hidden story components. If you do find them, you will learn where \"Timmy\" has been taken\n\nGameplay: \n\nThe game is played in First Person. The core aspects of the game are survival based. Hunger, Thirst, Rest, and Energy all make an appearance. You must hunt for food (or forage, alternatively), drink water, and sleep. So far, the survival aspects are pretty well balanced, and always being improved upon. \n\nYou are going to establish a \"base\" or camp of sorts. Shelters, fires, walls, traps, gardens, resource management, and food storage all come into play here. There are quite a few creatable structures/devices already, and more are going to be added. Base creation takes time. You must gather resources to build things. Many people feel this is \"grindy\" but I enjoy it a lot. You will find yourself collecting rocks, sticks, logs from trees, leaves, and other objects and transporting them back to your base. This takes time, but seeing your base take shape feels extremely rewarding. \n\nCombat is a necessary part of the game. You are stuck on an island populated by cannibal tribes. Hungry cannibal tribes. There is so much to say for the AI in this game. They are already impressive and quirky and only getting better. The cannibals are currently broken into three tribes.\n\nStarving/Skinnies.  These cannibals are very thin/lanky, often naked and covered in blood. They are almost always hostile to the player and have even been seen killing and eating fellow cannibals. Often acting as scouts, it is common to see solo skinnies roaming the island. When they find something of interest (deforestation, foreign structures, you) they will often hide and observe for a while. When satisfied, they will run back to their camp and alert fellow cannibals. If they located your base, expect to see patrols coming and going from now on. Skinnies are the weakest of all the cannibals, but they are EXTREMELY fast and agile. It is very easy for skinnies to dodge your attacks and get behind you when in combat. \n\nCannibals. The regular cannibals look like normal humans, with a few skin tones, often covered in dirt or decorations. They usually travel in groups of 2-4. They are not always hostile to the player, but it's always safer to assume they are. If they know your location it's common to see them roaming around the edges of your base. they are slower than skinnies but they usually carry clubs and hit much harder. They are prone to splitting up in combat, flanking and coming from behind the player. \n\nCave Cannibals. Gray skinned aliens, basically. Stronger than regular cannibals but a bit slower. use the same tactics and skills as above. \n\nThe AI is so awesome. They stalk you, they observe you, leave effigies outside your base (body parts on sticks) to mess with you, ambush you, scare you. You will find yourself fearing them, looking over your shoulder when doing even the simplest things. there are special varieties of mutants deep in the caves, but I'll leave that for you to discover.\n\nAll in all this game is excellent. The core concept and foundation are very well done. The developers add more and more, and try to stay on top of glitches and bugs. More is being added and the game is only 14.99 on Steam. 10/10 for me, I love this game and would recommend it to anyone.\n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nI have been playing this Multiplayer with a buddy of mine and it's amazing. This game is 10x better with a friend. We've had so much fun and I recommend anyone who enjoys it to try it with some friends. Beware though, the difficulty is increased for multiplayer. 11/10\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nI feel I need to take a moment to commend the Devs on this game. For a two man team (now 15-17 man team as the dev pointed out) they put an insane amount of work into this. There is an update timer on the main menu and anytime they go past the scheduled time, they always explain what happened and why. Every time they release an update there is always a hotfix for most of the new bugs the update causes within a day or two. This Dev team is literally a personification of what Early Access should be. They are such a great team and they really take the wishes of the community to heart. You will not regret the purchase, and these guys deserve support.

And one of the very few games that I consider to be a steal even at full price.[/h1]\n\nI always imagined myself being stranded on a beautiful tropical island. What would I do ? What would I eat ? How would I escape ?\n\nThe answers to all of these questions a lot more lie in The Forest. All of my fantasies came true when I first started the game and I saw what it was capable of. Everything from visuals, to sounds and gameplay just blew my mind. It is so chock full of content that even after 175 hours of play time, it [i]still[/i] manages to scare and surprise me. \n\nFor just $20 you get access to:\n[list]\n[*]Fully fleshed out survival experience with multiple endings\n[/list]\nYou will embark on a challenging quest to find your missing son. From the top of the mountain to the very bottom of the sinkhole. Fight your way through, sneak by unnoticed or [i]deceive[/i] your enemies. Build up your arsenal of weapons and tools. Hunt and gear up, become stronger, faster and more resistant. Build a home, set up walls and traps, go fishing, try out some of the local berries and mushrooms, build a boat, try out the diving gear or bring hell and distruction upon the nearby enemy camps. All up to you. \n[list]\n[*]Single Player and Coop\n[/list]\nI really enjoyed my first full single-player playthrough. And after that I was ready to join my friends on their adventures too. There's nothing more fun than exploring legitimately scary caves together. Or fulfilling your lifelong dream of becoming an all-star lumberjack crew. Building, trading, healing and fighting together is all incredibly fun in co-op.\n[list]\n[*]An extensive crafting system\n[/list]\nI don't think I've ever seen this many original and creative items to be used in survival game before. I've seen a lot of interesting props in other survival games before. But The Forest is the first one I've seen where you can actually use them. You can gather all sorts of useful things in this game. Including: weapons, armor, food, consumables, explosives, crafting materials, wearables, collectibles, dead body parts, maps, keys and much much more. And the best part is that almost all of them can be combined or used together in some way. You can craft all kinds of makeshift tools and deadly weapons. And those weapons and tools can then themselves be upgraded.. It's insane.\n[list]\n[*]Unique fauna and flora\n[/list]\nThis island is.. unnatural. There's way, way more than meets the eye. There's sunny beaches, deep lush forests, misty mountain ares and more. But beneath the island's mystery there lies a hauntingly beautiful paradise. With lots of interesting animals and critters. Who all have their own unique AI and preferred environments. Deer, rabbits, lizards and raccoons are but a few of the many beautiful creatures this game has to offer. These animals become an essential part of the player's survival. As some of them can be exploited for food, hide or other crafting materials. Hunt, trap or breed your own, whichever you prefer. Farming and growing your own plants is another great way to stock up on food and healing herbs.\n[list]\n[*]Exploration\n[/list]\nGolden beaches, deep lush forests, misty mountains and obscured caves. All very believable and extremely well designed. I once spent 15 minutes just holding W and looking UP while walking circles in a pine forest. It was [i]that[/i] beautiful. The wind in the bushes, the branches tapping against the trees, the birds singing their last - all a joy to behold. And a blissful retreat for your ears. \n\nNothing in the world compares to the tense feeling a player gets upon their first descent into these dark dripping caves. It's like entering a completely remote, uncharted territory. Their territory. Will you use a bright torch and risk being seen ? Or stumble in the dark, risking to fall to your death. Or will you throw a flare in order to create a distraction perhaps. All up to you. I both love and hate the cave system. I love it because it's really spooky and there's never a dull moment down there. But I hate the helpless feeling of being disoriented, confused and utterly lost within it's never ending branching corridors. But maybe that's exactly the point. To make you feel tiny and suspicious of every shadow and echo. \n[list]\n[*]Combat\n[/list]\nLet me just start with the fact that there are a lot of weapons in this game. Some you can craft, and some you have to find. But they all have one thing in common - they're effective and very satisfying to use. Some weapons are better at blocking, while others excel at slashing or dismembering your enemies. You have both ranged and melee. As well as some.. unique items. These bows and spears and axes can be upgraded or enhanced in some way. Like covering your axe with a piece of cloth covered in alcohol and then lighting it on fire. Or using custom arrows, that can poison your enemies or straight up light them on fire. Very diverse arsenal, with a few very welcome surprises.\n[list]\n[*]VR\n[/list]\nAnd if all of the above wasn't enough -- this game comes with a fully working single-player/coop VR mode. I tried it myself, and it is shockingly good. Even more so than a bunch of exclusively VR games. It totally nails the movement system, the arms, looking around, fighting, collecting stuff, everything. It is so much fun! And the best part is that you can actually play with people who don't own a VR too. And they can see you chop down a tree in real time, as you flail around in real life. Extremely well done, I'm addicted and I spent at least 8 hours this week in The Forest VR alone.\n\n\n\n[b]In conclusion:[/b]\n\nThis game is something special. One of the very few titles who not only made it out of Early Access with flying colors. But also manages to release regular updates, always on time and with great success. In fact they actually coded in a countdown timer in the game itself. Letting people know exactly when the next update is due.\n\nFree content and updates, patches and hotfixes, helping users on the forums -- Endnight Games has done it all and continues to do so to this very day. They are a model development team and their game is 100% worthy of your time and money. \n\nI strongly recommend this game to all survival genre fans that love playing polished, finished products. Who are creative with their resources and are not afraid of a challenge. People who love an adventure that keeps them on their toes and rewarding those who are brave enough to take a leap of faith into the unknown.", "timestamp_created": 1529602142, "timestamp_updated": 1529602198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 327, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.917195498943328857", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25025574": {"recommendationid": "25025574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127604459", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548036352}, "language": "english", "review": "You remember when teams of developers actually cared about their game, listened to feedback, recommondations, and bug reports?

I will admit, the game in its current state isn't necessarily packed with things to do, but the amazing aspect of this game is the atmosphere. It is absolutely breathtaking how immersive a game can be when it lays out the environment and characters correctly. Night time and caves in this game are downright horrifying. The cannibals and mutants are already some of the most gruesome, terrifying antagonists I have seen in a game, and it gets much worse when your source of light is a lighter and you are anticipating ravenous freaks jumping out at you from the dark. Even the aspects of the game that don't make you shit your pants are great, I find it very fun and sometimes relaxing just walking around hunting and building. The survival aspect of this game is great. Exploration in this game is as rewarding as it is fun, in fact you need to go to some of the caves around the map to beat the game. If you decide to play this game, I STRONGLY recommend finding all of the crucial tools to beating the game for yourself. It is so fun and feels great building up everything you need to get to the end, which is also amazing and blew my mind. I don't believe I have played a game before that manages to be an actually scary horror game, a relaxing survival game, and a game that strongly entices you to explore everything.

Tons of potential, and playable with a ceiling right now in single player, but like most of this genre's early access titles, it depends where they go from here.  Seems like a great team is behind this though.\n\nThey just released multiplayer, which as you can imagine, requires a LOT of adjustment to code.  But you can easily see the potential here once its fully implemented.  \n\nFor those that are considering this for multiplayer as of Jan 7th 2015:\n-Players that are not the game's host cannot save their progress (each time the game is launched they will lose all inventory/upgrades)\n-As the host of my multiplayer instance, I can pull an unlimited amount of logs/sticks/rocks from holders after a save.\n-loot is not shared (only you can loot what you see on the ground, you cannot give food/items to another player)\n\nAnd some Pros that make this game standout from the rest of the genre:\n\nEnvironment:  \nThe graphics and atmosphere are actually amazing.  The Forest is beautiful and alive during the day, and perfectly creepy and unsettling at night.\n\nBalance:\nWhile this is preference-based, I appreciated the balance balance between resource gathering, building, hunting, and combat.  The right mix leads to a sensation that you are not only surviving, but constantly building towards thriving.  Its setup perfectly for multiplayer assuming they work out shared items.  (We had 2 players chopping down trees, and 2 running log carts back to the base, and we felt all effecient about it!)\n\nPotential:\nMy favorite review of this game is easily \"Bad Parent Simulator 2014\" (c: Barry Scott)  At the beginning of the game, you hazily watch your son being taken from you by a cannibal.  The story ends there at the moment.  All it would take is one good writer to add a rediculous amount of substance to the single-player, and possibly mutliplayer as well.  \n\nIn conclusion, this team has so much of the difficult aspects of the game complete.  From the graphics, mechanics, overall environment creation, and its easy to see that with just a little more love, at worst, this will be a must-own for the genre, at best, a trendsetter and genre-defining.", "timestamp_created": 1420682693, "timestamp_updated": 1420682693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 149, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.881207108497619629", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40214569": {"recommendationid": "40214569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054866903", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519686347}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright, so, here's what happened. I got the Forest sometime last year via Humble Bundle, and it went on the shelf. I didn't look into the game AT ALL. This is important. \n\nA day or two ago I was going through my various unredeemed keys and redeeming them.  I noticed a game called \"The Forest\"  \n\n\"I remember that\" I said to myself. \"I think it was a chill exploration and crafting game\"\n\nIT WAS NOT.\n\nI thought the game opening was a little dark, but I headed out from the starting area, and made my way to the coast.  I somehow didn't trip over any particularly odd sights on my way there.  I saw some odd stick structures off in the distance, and made a note to look at them at some point. Right now, I had a shelter to build!\n\nAs I wandered the nearby area, gathering sticks, killing turtles, and making my first steps towards comfort on this island, I saw something moving in the distance. \"Oh, what is that? A monkey?\" I wondered, as I approached slowly.  \"Oh! A native. I wonder if I can speak to him, or trade?\"  The native saw me, and made...a noise. Not a human noise, either. It charged. I FREAKED OUT, swinging my axe and cursing.  \n\n I thought to myself \"Ok, this island has natives. Whatever, this guy went down easy, and I've got a metal axe. I've got the edge, and I'm only gonna get more ahead. Besides, how many of these things can there be?\"\n\nThings did not improve.\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is how The Forest feels.

Don't get me wrong here, it doesn't stand too far from most of those games, but in the key areas it does stand out on, are the area that are simply the most important.\n\nThe key point as to why I am recommending this ---> CONSTANT updates with content and bug fixes.  This is huge for an Early Access game.  It went from being a nifty OKish single player adventure game, to an amzing co-op survival open world game in a mere 6 month span.  Content constantly get's added, AI re-worked(which is interestingly impressive as is), new crafting recipes, parts of the Island reworked are all updates that come out in regular intervals.\n\nI won't go into the game details other than that the game is actually very fun to play.

Plane crashes, some naked tribal guy takes said child, and you're on your own.\n\nEvery time you start a new game the plane will be somewhere else so you wont know where you are every time. You start off with the basics, candy, beer, a fire axe, a heart monitor (that you'll never use) and food. You'll have a survival handbook that is very useful, itll tell you what to do as well as give you a way to build things like a fire or a place to sleep, even walls to keep you safe. \n\nWhen you hop off the plane (and taking the fire axe out of Stacy's face) you will either be greeted with sunshine or greeted by 3 naked people about to destroy you together.\n\nAt this point, if you're lucky, no one will bother you. If you're unlucky however, and the naked tibal people see you and run after you, good luck defending yourself with a fire axe and some snacks (oh and pills). \n\nI love the visuals of this game, it's very beautiful. The sunshine, the darkness, all close to realistic. I love the level of darkness at night, it's just enough to hinder vision, but not enough to be annoying. The weather is pretty awesome too, the only problem I have with the weather is the rain, I got tired of this routine:\n1. You are cold and wet\n2. Get warm by fire\n3. Rain stops, ventures out of base/camp\n4. Rains again 15 seconds later making you run back to camp/base just to get warm\n5. See step one\n\nOn to the enemies: I hate them. They are annoying, buggy, and overpowered at times. I would be in my camp that is surrounded by big tall walls, and suddenly *INCEPTION MUSIC BWUM*. I would look around and see no one, then suddenly a bunch of them run through the walls and runs right back out. This gets annoying, especially when they warp into your camp and hit you from below your log cabin. When you finally have the balls/girl balls to venture out of your camp/base, you see a single naked woman watching you, then walking up to you, then hits you once taking over half your health (perfect time to look at that heart monitor!!). You swing your axe at them but your attacks are SO slow that she hits you 2 times before your next swing. \n\nOther than the things I mentioned, I love the IDEA of the enemies, they watch you, study you, instead of attacking sometimes. I love the idea of stealthing around these naked people or being stalked by them. I know it sounds weird, but these elements are not implimented well in other games, I would love this open-world survival horror game to have a moment where you hear a sound and if you're lucky, you'll see one running away.\n\nThe food: You have only a few choices on food that I've encountered: Candy bar, fish, rabbits, and plants. I hated that more often than not I'm being forced to stop everything just to eat a bunny. I have trouble getting the fish, they swim too far from where you can stand and fish from, meaning you have to stand and hope they swim close to you and not swim out into the ocean. Don't get me started on the sharks in the ocean, they spawn a safe distance, SOMETIMES, once they spawned right at the edge of the water, you can't go in without being eaten. Honestly the hunting, other than the tech issues, is amazing compaired to other games. To fish (at the moment you must find a sharp spear, can't make it yet) you get a sharp spear and go look for the ocean or a pond. You stand over the fish and stab them, making them stick to your pole. This is amazing, it's small but it's great that you don't just go up to a fish and press \"take\". To hunt (there are only rabbits to hunt and eat at the moment) you either grab your fire axe and start running after them and swinging away, or you make a rabbit trap. \n\nThe building: I love the fact that you can make yourself a camp and stay safe. When you look at your survival guide, you can build walls, cabins, steps, a tree house, and other things. They keep you safe from those naked people that want to sacrifice your body to the \"Bieber\" they keep seeing in the magazines on planes. I love that if you build a fire, they will come and try to kill you. If I were a tribal naked person and this guy that was in a plane crash made a camp out of 50 logs that are bigger than him in less than 2 days all by himself, I would avoid him completely.\n\nThe game is in development, so there are some bugs that I've run into, here is a list of a few:\n-Gets killed by a naked Leelo and I wake up in a cave surrounded by 3 more naked girls and gets pummeled by them almost instantly. This isn't normal, you have a bit more time than that to recover.\n-End of the level, missing textures, trees in water, a message that says you can't go this way yet, it's not available in this version of the game\". When that happened, I was staving looking for fish in water, and never saw one for miles.\n-Made a big base with large walls and stuff to keep safe, but a bunch of enemies run straight through it and attack me.\n-I suddenly start swimming while I was cutting down a tree, I am able to slowly swim off into the sunset above the ground and over the trees. Felt great but it was a game-breaking bug, I can't save and come back, the glitch will still be there.\n-I walk into a cave, start slowly rising upward, looks like I'm swimming then suddenly dropped from a high place and dies.\n\nAll in all, I loved this game, it needs a lot of work but if they continue to build it even after the alpha is released, it would turn out to be a outstanding game. I recommend this game because it has potential to be a epic game, if they put love and care into it.\n\nSuggestions (keep in mind these are probly added by the time anyone reads this):\n-I want to make a strong spear, adding a utility knife would make things a lot easier, you can cut the sticks to make a spear\n-More things to hunt. This is more than likely added very soon.\n-Don't make caves seperate than the main world. Every time you go into a cave, the world outside isn't there anymore, causing issues with framerate and crashes.\n-A story. Surviving is it's own reward, but where did that kid go? Did they mistake him for their idol \"Bieber\"?\n-Random events: Imagine this, you are walking in the forest, you hear a sound, you look around but see nothing, then when you turn to look in front of you there's a guy and he grabs your neck or tries to stab you, QTE moment. Or imagine this, you made a base, heavily fortified with big walls. One night you are eating your rabbit with a side of Butterfingers when suddenly you hear some chanting. You look over your wall and see a bunch of naked people with a very large log making their way to your wall, threatening to knock it down. Events like this make the game a LOT more fun and random.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my review, thanks for reading! <3\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1414558554, "timestamp_updated": 1414558554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 125, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.892588615417480469", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "43725859": {"recommendationid": "43725859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125523850", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1536584229}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros\n+ You can fight against naked canibals. \n+ You can throw tennisballs to each other.\n+ Jumping enemy babys.\n+ Noisy bat screams in caves.\n\nCons\n- Framedrop when you enter caves.\n- Can't sleep anymore.\n\nConclusion: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1532477255, "timestamp_updated": 1532477292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 77, "votes_funny": 105, "weighted_vote_score": "0.870590269565582275", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35069929": {"recommendationid": "35069929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013641421", "num_games_owned": 322, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 5895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548272189}, "language": "english", "review": "Sure, I only have 9 hours thus far on record but I can tell you I'm absolutely loving it.\n\nThe thing that stands this out from other survival type games is the enemies and their AI.\n\nShortly after crashing in an unknown land you wake up and have to sort yourself out with surviving.

The way they behave (besides some occasional pathing bugs) is really good. Other than being a survival game it can be quite scary too.  Don't even get me started on the caves. I shat myself when i first got killed and dragged down into one of them with nothing more but a lighter (Which had a lighting range of roughly a meter)  and an axe with me. Or when i entered a village hoping it would be empty just to get charged by a whole army of cannibals. The game can be properly scary.

I heard screams near camp on beach so i healed up and made some fire bombs and got my axe. I found 4 of them on Beach burned 2 of them and beat the crap outta the other 2 with my axe. chopped off all their body parts brought it back to camp and stacked their limbs to sticks show my victory! \n\n\n10/10 cant wait for game to fully be finished.", "timestamp_created": 1432402757, "timestamp_updated": 1432402757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 148, "votes_funny": 57, "weighted_vote_score": "0.902744829654693604", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "44586910": {"recommendationid": "44586910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165449742", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1536491991}, "language": "english", "review": "To sit with a friend at night and play this game is simply priceless @_@", "timestamp_created": 1536170301, "timestamp_updated": 1536170301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 71, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.86290895938873291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17686150": {"recommendationid": "17686150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083453513", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1541323200}, "language": "english", "review": "Day 42:\n\n    I have established several camps around the island. Some are well fortified and if the natives choose to attack on a large scale these locations will surely be the choices for my retreat.

From what I have seen so far, this group is the only that dwell under ground through out the cave systems. To date, I have never seen the surface group enter the caves.

Maybe hit you once, then run away to see how you react. Another interesting example, is when I encountered a couple of them surrounding a corpse. They seemed to be very protective of it, running in circles around it, as to say \"This is mine. Stay away\". After a little bit of playing around with them to see how they would react, I found myself surrounded by several more and mauled in a territorial dispute. Another awesome feature in the AI is that you can go many days laying low, without them even knowing of your presence, while if one spots you near your base, they will come back later in a larger group to investigate, marking the area with effigies to warn others of your presence.\n\nNight time is absolutely terrifying before you establish a solid defensive base.

When you die, you lose most of your items, and all of that hard work you did gathering and crafting materials are flushed down the drain (like your dreams). And please, don't come in expecting your character to have the strength and endurance of Batman. Because he'll die. Very many times. And his hunger (and hydration) bar depletes faster than that of a Sim.\n\nIt's not your average hack-and-slash-everything-to-survive game, either. The Forest has implemented impressive and dynamic AI. The cannibals (the primary antagonists) have emotions, morals, religions, etc., and they come from different families and tribes. How one tribe of cannibals react to you will vary from another tribe; some will avoid you out of fear, some will come after you out of anger (for killing members). They change their patterns to accommodate you, and they utilize different strategies and members of their tribe to take you down. It all depends on how you choose to interact with the environment and the AI you encounter.\n\nIf you're looking for a decent, somewhat stressful survival game without the massive multiplayer feel of Day-Z and Rust, The Forest is for you. The game manages to keep you on your toes without it ever feeling too safe or too easy.\n\nArrive in the forest. Thrive in the forest.

While I haven't accrued too many hours yet, I will post a review of my experience so far. \n\nI've been very impressed so far with the building system in The Forest.  It reminds me of the system for base construction in Fallout 4 except implemented much better.  Placed structures usually mesh nicely with terrain and allow the user to place them almost anywhere, even on top of one another.  You can mesh walls into towers into supports and other structures well to make a continuous base without ugly gaps or places where objects fail to make good contact with uneven terrain.  I've had a lot of fun just building bases with friends.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is also well done.  You start stranded on an uncharted island, awakening after a plane crash.  As you explore the island further, you find all kinds of creepy and tortured corpses of other would-be survivors of the plane wreck.  The island is also inhabited by the cannibals, which are similar in appearance to the Forsworn in Skyrim.  There is also ambiance such as wild animals and nice graphics which make the island feel alive.  Night time is very dark and you're often equipped with a lighter or a torch for visibility.  Construction of permanent lamps for your base that never burn out using skulls of slain cannibals lets you create a very homey feeling base against the darkness of the night.  It gives nice atmosphere and feels like you're stranded in a forbidding forest.  If you really hate the night, you can sleep through it, but I enjoy it.\n\nThe cannibals are a constant threat against survival and they seem to attack in larger and more powerful groups as you survive longer.  Some of them can even destroy some of your walls and structures.  I like this feature, as it feels like you're making a fort to hold against a siege rather than just purely for decoration.  Some of the more advanced enemy creatures are also really creepy looking and add to the atmosphere of The Forest and its mysterious island.  I have often wondered if these were the results of experimentation carried out on other survivors in some Frankensteinian lab or something below the surface.\n\nThere's also a lot of areas to explore.  You find interesting and unique things located around the island the game is centered on, and there are caves to explore too.  I haven't gotten very deep into these caves yet.  The game also, while giving a good and large map to explore with many interesting places, provides means for avoiding getting lost.  Player nametags are always visible from any distance.  Your base will show up from any distance with a marker.  Lastly, you can place flags and beacons to mark places of interest.  These features make the game navigable.\n\nControl of the game is good.  It comes with a full set of keys to remap and adjusters for mouse sensitivity.  As a left-handed gamer, this was important to me.  There is also a wide array of graphics settings to change that get quite in-depth and customizable.  The game's sound is also good.  It has all the pieces in place to make a game enjoyable, and no major things are lacking in this regard.  It's also relatively bug free, especially given it's still early access.  \n\nI would make one word of caution for this game, however.  It is a whole lot more fun with friends, and I'd recommend trying it out as a group instead of solo.  I feel that group play is immensely more fun than solo play.  I haven't tried to meet new friends on the game merely through its avenues, but it may prove difficult to network and create new friends in-game on your own as the options available are either solo play or co-op, which allows people to join the game if you invite them off your steam friends list.\n\nI recommend this game if you like survival games or enjoy games where you can build bases.

But stepping into The Forest for the first time, sent chills down my spine, and simultaneously made my jaw hit the floor. \nGiven this experience has only really JUST begun for me, Sitting happily at about 13 hours at the current clock, I felt its my duty to all the gamers out there, to review this game and get as many people behind it as possible!\n\nI usually break my reviews down into 4 categories, Gameplay, Graphics, Story and Music followed by an Overall section If you prefer shorter reviews, you can skip down the \"Overall\" header, I do this to provide as much possible ground work for you to create your own opinions from mine, or even better yet persuade or disuade you from the purchase. So with no further adieu, Please enjoy my review of...The Forest.\n\nStory:\nThis is a difficult one for me to detail heavily on the story aspects because i haven't really discovered much of it yet, there appears to be quite alot of little details scattered around the islands many nooks and crannies that help reveal the story to the players as they ...patrol..(for lack of a better word that doesn't make me sound like a complete coward) the island, looking for their Kidnapped son (No spoiler warning required, it literally happens in the first 2 minutes).\nI really love how it is all left to your own decisions really, there are pictures, drawings, dead passengers from your flight scattered vigorously across the island, and horrifically displayed, to really engulf you in the beauty and cruelty of this island and what has lead it to what it has become. As you again \"patrol\" the island you will discover pieces of the islands history, pieces of your own story and pieces of what has happened to your son. An extremely rewarding and effective way of story telling in a survival game. Excellent.\n\nGameplay:\nDefinitely the easiest part of this early stage review to write, the gameplay is near flawless, for a survival game it has done what very few survival games have, Let me play it alone, There is literally NO need for you to have other people playing it with you, Not that i have a problem with playing multiplayer, but absolutely requiring it to progress, or to stay alive is extremely daunting and near impossible in everyones busy schedules. This game DOES have a multiplayer mode, but i have found it to be less of an experience when other people are present, and it really deters from the overall mood the game tries to set out.\nI vaguely remember crawling around hiding under beds and in lockers in Outlast trying to be free of the never ending parade of enemies that wanted to eat my spleen, This game has definitely enveloped that experience as a whole and turned it into its own mind afflicting horror, this is probably due to the almost unpredictable enemies that encroach but don't attack, or just watch you run across the beach from the top of the sheer cliff faces, planning and plotting your doom. You remember when you're a child and you hear noises coming from around your room in the pitch black of night, and you just sit there wishing it was day time. That is basically this game in a nutshell.\nThe crafting system and inventory system are intertwined in this game i have to admit, it is very satisfying how it is displayed for you, on a open blanket (i guess thats what it is) where you can visibly see everything you are carrying scattered across it where you can select items, combine them to upgrade or even to create entirely new items from the components, a little unrealistic, if not entirely unrealistic of how much 1 random person who isn't very fit can actually carry, but nonetheless, a very interesting concept i would LOVE to see in more games, it really helps make you feel like you're in a survival situation, the building crafting on the other hand is done through the \"survival guide\" which is another great idea, really giving you some kind of starting spot to build from, teaching you what to do first, where to go from there, as well as tracking all your notes and keeping a track of your personal statistics, like Strength and athleticism, and the more importantly your ever decaying sanity. (Both in and out of the game, lol).\nThis games enemy AI is extremely taxing on you as a player, continually unsure of what the enemy is planning, or what they are going to do in combat can really take its toll on you in the game, But i have personally found the combat to be fair despite the enemies significant advantage of being part Spiderman and the hitting power of the Incredible Hulk, The whole \"demoralising\" your enemy to ensure your safety concept is particularly interesting to me, where you create effigies from the ...body parts of your fallen enemies and display them as some sort of graphic portrayal of power and supremacy...Or just aggravate an entire tribe into your own death. I have to admit, maybe its a psychological issue of mine but carving up the enemy bodies is oddly satisfying, mainly because i've never been able to in a game and the concept is like the cavemen discovering fire.\nDespite my admiration for this game, it has a rather large glaring flaw that i can see, the days are far too short in my opinion, I understand they wanted to scale the experience into rather \"rapid\" days so that the enemies can be seen formally becoming braver, and your progress is stifled slightly, but i would definitely enjoy more time in the day or lighttime to explore and even scavenge materials, even an extra 10-15 minutes as a whole would be absolutely perfect.\n\nGraphics:\nI attempted to run this game on all the settings to see the difference in graphical quality between Ultra Low and High, and there is a significant leap in graphical quality present in the drop/increase. I am currently playing it on High, with a rather stationary FPS of approximately 60 on a mid to high end PC. The game is really quite stunning as a whole though, with relatively short load screens despite the amount of deforesting and building i have completed so far.\nThe Forests......in The Forest are incredibly detailed and there are plenty of things to enjoy the sights of, when you aren't crying in the mud.\n\nMusic:\nThere isn't a huge variety of music in this game, from what i've gathered it seems to flicker in and out depending on the time of day, what you're doing and who is around you, I guess this is done for atmosphere, so you can hear the enemies around you, or even the russling of trees which i have to admit freaked me out on many occasions. I think the amount of music is perfect for this type of game, you don't want to feel like you're on an epic adventure, nor do you want to feel like you can crush the enemy forces easily. This is a dead set straight edge survival game, and limiting the music to hear your environment is extremely important to the experience.\n\nOverall:\nThis game does so much really well and very little badly, perhaps the enemies are scaled rather badly, even on normal difficulty you can't really survive their onslaughts for very long, But even \"deaths\" in the game can end up being story based and help you discover more about the island and its inhabitants. This game has been an extremely rewarding experience so far, and i hope to keep updating this game, as it improves , and as i continue to play through it.\nAt my current standpoint, this game is a definite purchase, even as we stand now, i have probably encourage several of my friends to buy it, not to play together, but just to enjoy the experience that was developed here.\nDon't hesitate and $20 USD this game is well worth your money and if you love survival games and horror, you will absolutely adore this game.", "timestamp_created": 1526372262, "timestamp_updated": 1526456959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 104, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.862840414047241211", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45346814": {"recommendationid": "45346814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390806247", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1540068576}, "language": "english", "review": "My experience playing the Forest\nDay 1: Okay, I survived a plane crash.

In the beginning of the game your in a plane with your son Timmy. Then plane crashes to the island killing almost everyone in it. You somehow survive the crash and when you wake up you see some man taking your son with him.\n\nYour primary mission in this game is to find and save Timmy and somehow survive on the island by collecting resources and crafting tools, buildings and weapons. To survive you have to find food, clean water and build a shelter. Also you have to prevent dying from cold, sharks and all kinds of creatures that want to kill you.\n\nThere are many kinds of creatures in The Forest. There are normal enemies like cannibals that live in their own villages. They guard the island area and will attack you when in eye contact. Also there are \"pale\" enemies that are like cannibals but much stronger and faster. They can be found everywhere on the island and in caves while normal cannibals only spawn in their villages. From cannibals and pales you can collect bodyparts which can be used to cook food or decoration structures. After cannibals there are much more dangerous creatures living out there. There are creatures called mutants which can contain several body parts more than a normal human. There are mutants called \"cowman\", \"virginia\", \"armsy\" and \"babies\". By killing mutants you won't get anything so I would recommend to stay away from those if you are new in the game. Mutants can be found in caves and other places where is some valuable loot to found. They are like guards for the loot. As you play further the game, mutants will also spawn outside the caves. Also as you survive more nights, cannibals and mutants will get more difficult to kill and more aggressive. They'll also start breaking your shelter/buildings. The best way to protect your buildings and yourself from enemies is to run away and hide. If you like fighting you can also fight but make sure to have armor, good weapons, meds, bombs and flares when fighting stronger enemies.\n\nIn The Forest there are a ton of different weapons, armor, tools, buildings, defensive structures, plants, food and other items. Most common items like leaves, sticks, berries and plants can be collected from forests or shores. Rarer things like dynamite, booze and flares can be found in caves and in some special camping sites/cannibal villages. The rarest items like axes, chainsaw, flashlight and katana can be found only in some special places deep in caves. They are most likely to be guarded by several mutants or pale enemies so be careful!\n\nThe most important thing to stay alive is to prevent starving so you have to find food (can be found in caves, you can hunt animals for food, farm food..) and something to drink (water can be collected from springs and rivers, booze and soda can be found in caves and villages). Also you have to build a shelter and a fire to stay warm and energic.\n\nThe Forest ratings:\n\nGameplay: 9/10, Very confortable and easy to learn. Crafting, finding resources, fighting enemies, preventing starvation and cold, exploring the island and caves. Contains some bugs which could affect gameplay a little.\n\nGraphics: 8,5/10, Realistic and beautiful graphics. Some items and areas are very detailed. Many common bugs which don't much affect playing. There could pop up some signs of lazyness of developers because almost all foods have same details when eating.\n\nSoundtrack: 8/10, Some sounds are realistic some are just ridiculous. Listening to footsteps and shouting coming all around you in the caves and in the middle of a dark forest is just awesome and creepy feeling.\n\nStory: 7/10, Pretty weird, deep and funny story to play. Won't spoil it, you have to play it yourself. Story stops like to the wall in the ending of the game but I believe they are adding more story in future updates or in full release of the game.\n\nSingleplayer: Yes\nMultiplayer: Yes, I recommend playing through game in co-op, believe me it gets very funny.\nMod support: Yes, you could test some community made mods with console ( your game could end up crashing or your world could get glitches)\nRequired computer: Medium if you want to play with decent graphics, High if you want to play with awesome graphic and art effects.\n\nIs this game worth buying?\n-Yes. Absolutely. I bought this game for 15\u20ac but its 10\u20ac on sale. Not a big difference tho. Its definitely worth its low price for a adventure/open world/first person game. I appreciate that creators of this game could make price tag such low. They put si much effort into this game.\n\nIs this a good game?\n-Yes. If you like survival/adventure/open world games with some horror elements, this is for you. Co-op makes this at least twice as fun. Surviving in a mutant forest with a friend. Can you imagine anything more fun? Althought if you are buying this game for its horror, I would recommend to not buy it. I found jumpscares and hearing and seeing enemies come all around me pretty scary but for hardcore horror fans this is nothing.

Don't know how I survived, but I think I caught a glimpse of some strange tribal man before I lost consciousness. After I awoke I set to the business of building a shelter. Who knows how long it'll be till I'm rescued.\n\nDay 2: The tribals seem unfriendly. They showed up at the edge of my camp and eyed me while growling. They have clubs made out of human skulls and seem to be wearing teeth around their necks. I'm going to set up traps tonight.\n\nDay 3: Some random skinny tribal tried to eat me! He came into my camp giggling and laughing, I had to kill him with my axe! Its the first time I've killed anyone. I dumped his body outside of camp. I don't like to look at it.\n\nDay 4: The more healthy tribals tried to siege my camp today. Attacked me uprovoked but a few of my traps caught them. I killed the last man with a more modern axe I scavenged from a camp. They'll not catch me unprepared again. I'm not dying on this bloody island.\n\nDay 5: After seeing that they have some kind of displays made out of human remains, I decided to do the same. It was disguisting and unthinkable but maybe now they'll realize this place is dangerous and give me some peace. Got a little hunting done too.\n\nDay 6: I've been forced to build a wall around the perimeter. The healthier, smarter tribals seem to be warded off by my effigy but the starving ones are desperate enough to risk attacking. I'm going to fortify this place. I'm not becoming somone's lunch.\n\nDay 7: While checking my traps outside camp I was attacked by some kind of weird tribal leader with armor made out of human arms. He and his war party were no match for my defenses. I stuck their heads outside camp. Maybe now they'll learn what will happen should they come here again.\n\nDay 10: I've been a little too busy to write in my journal recently. I decided to take the fight to them and burned one of their camps with molotovs. A week ago, their screams would have bothered me. Now I was just relieved. Maybe now I'll be able to sleep at night.\n\nDay 11: A huge monster with a ton of legs busted in through my outer wall. Fortunately I'd stashed away some explosives, so that made quick work of it. On closer examination this thing seems to be made out of...people. Sewn or mutated together somehow. What is happening in this place!?\n\nDay 15: I cut off the heads of every tribal leader and put them on sticks. The sticks litter the outside of my camps. They'll regret the day they attacked my camps. I'll kill every last one of them if I have to. Even those mutant monsters will die.\n\nDay 20: I decided to start adding legs to the effigies. It seems to complete them a little more. Even the starving tribals are wary of attacking me now. They know that death has come among them.\n\nDay 30: I'd been so busy fighting off these tribals I didn't get a chance to hunt for days at a time. Haven't had time to write in my journal either. I'd walked into one of their camps I'd ransacked and saw an arm stick cooking on a spit. I was so hungry I took a bite. It wasn't too bad actually. I'm trying not to think about it.\n\nDay 45: I added arms and legs pointing in different directions to each of my effigies to spell out \"YMCA\". Nothing really else to do to pass my time here. When I was putting them up, I ate one of the legs. I was very hungry and none of my traps have been yielding any fruit, but these perfectly good limbs have been sitting here all this time...\n\nDay 62: I'm starting to like it here...All the limbs I can eat. Good sunshine by the beach. This island isn't so bad.\n\n10/10 would decend into madness again.\n\nUPDATE: Day 184: I Currently have a stronghold of death. Rock walls the size of trees. Mountains of bodies connected to effigies. Traps inside every wall. I don't know where these animals are coming from but they seem to be endless. There has to be a source. I've killed more than I can possibly count. More than this island seems to be able to support, yet they keep coming.\n\nI found a strange door exploring one of the caves. It has a keycard slot.

Sometimes you cause fear, sometimes intrigue, these natives don't act in a singular 'standard' manner. Your interaction with them and the habitat around you all contribute to the circumstances you will find yourself in.\n\nEarly Access can be a minefield, I know, I have supported quite a few but I would like to point out that the developers of this game are the most hard working and dedicated team I have come across in the Early Access Genre. (If you don't believe me, go and check out their changelog for the last 12 months) As soon as you boot the game it will tell you when the next update is due (on average, every 28 days) and every update consists of a massive list of changes, fixes and tweaks.\n\nThere is no good reason I can think of not to buy this game if you like the survival genre, it ticks more boxes than any other game of it's type.

I fear not to give enough credit deserved and every word is carefully picked in order to show what the said game is about and why it should be purchased.\n\nI will start off by telling why The Forest shines brighter than other survival games. I always found frustrating the neverending material farming in similar titles, days spent chopping, cutting, slashing just to build a very small hut that would get destroyed in a blink of an eye. The Forest is different. While it still takes time to craft something, you don't have to spend an entire day gathering resources. There are many available structures, with many functions (some structures having more than one fuction, as they can be extremely versatile).\n\nAnother typical feature of a survival game is the how-to-spend-the-night moment. I've always seen that moment as the one where you try to stay safe, where any lurking threat has to be avoided until you get a proper equipment to fight back (if you can fight back at all). In The Forest, with a proper strategy, you can drive away the cannibals (the main enemies) even from the first night. \n\nHoping to have given proper credit to this game so far, I'll now start listing what I personally find extremely splendid about it:\n\n[list]\n[*] [b] Enemy AI: [/b] The cannibals are extremely intelligent, and their behaviour constantly develops following your gameplay; if you try to avoid them, they will look at you with curiosity, studying your movements without harming you. If you show an aggressive behaviour they will strike with an increasing force, calling for help and attacking your base weakest spots. If you are merciless they may end up fearing you, whereas if you spare some of them, they will respect you, seeing you as a godlike figure.\nThey have multiple strategies as well: they send scouts to check your base and equipment, plan surprise attacks in the day, build different totems around to inform the others (there are lots of totems, each of them with a different purpose) or to summon special enemies (mutants).\n[*] [b] Co-Op mode: [/b] This is the real way to play The Forest in my opinion. Grab your friends and start playing together; the voice option (you can communicate with your real voice through an in-game Walkie Talkie) adds up to the immersion, and your voice can actually lure cannibals as they can hear you too. You can also trade items, in case a friend is in need of a particular resource; you can organize turns and roles thanks to this. Building, fighting and surviving with your friends is an incredible experience in The Forest, it's extremely fun and addictive!\n[*] [b] The story: [/b] The storyline plays an important role in The Forest, and gives you an exciting purpose to venture the island to find your lost son. As you crawl into the caves, sail the sea or climb the mountains you will find details of what's going on, or what happened before your arrival. There's always something to find, from creepy to disturbingly fun discoveries.\n[*] [b] Updates: [/b] I believe that this is the most updated Early Access game every played. There's always a new planned update that adds so many new features and fixes bugs (once you start the game there is a countdown to the next update), and it makes The Forest a title that you cannot stop playing as there will always be something new. A big kudos to the devs for this!\n[*] [b] Optimization:[/b] Yes, the game is demanding in terms of minimal requirements, however I'd like to highlight the optimization aspect. I run this game on two PCs, a not-so-high-end laptop (which barely meets the minimum specs) and a potato desktop. I can perfectly run on medium settings on the former (without fps drops or stuttering, and on high settings with some small stutter in tense moments of fight), and low settings on the latter (without fps drops) and still looks amazing! You can run The Forest with the setting you like and it will still have a beautiful look.\n\nThe price of the game should be tempting as well. For that ridiculous sum you get an amazing survival game (I dare to say, the best so far) in constant development, with a dev team that actually listens to player's feedbacks and seems to be more excited than us to work on this project. \nIt's an Early Access game but it already has more content that most of the \"finished\" titles.\n\nGrab this game and I am sure you will NOT regret it!!", "timestamp_created": 1468864325, "timestamp_updated": 1542873915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 121, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.878427386283874512", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25300954": {"recommendationid": "25300954", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992715268", "num_games_owned": 503, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511140310}, "language": "english", "review": "I could write a little story about any number of awesome situations this game will throw at you. But I don't feel like it truely explains what you will be buying.\n\nHere is what this game offers:\nPretty graphics - The game looks awesome,from watching the sunrise because you finally got a break from the night raiding parties to watching the sun disappear knowing things go bump in the night and every moment inbetween is beautiful. \n\nFocused crafting - Everything has a purpose or is planned to have a purpose..even the little things like cutting up a cannibal and showcasing him in your yard will upset his buddies.\n\nActive devs - I've never seen another EA project match their dedication. On the home menu, it literally has a countdown timer for the upcoming patch. These devs actually give themselves a deadline so they don't lose focus and they use that time to give meaningful updates and minor changes. They listen to their customers. I've seen them add features, tweak features and remove features based on feedback. Your opinion matters here.\n\nTrue horror - Players have put hundreds of hours into the forest, explored every inch of the island, built a fortress and slayed hundreds of cannibals...yet still refuse to leave their base at night or dive deeper into the caves unless they're stuffed with flares and explosives. There is an element of fear in this game that you never really get used to. Things lurk in the shadows, make unnerving sounds, harass you at night, sneak up on you during the day and drag you into the dark when they win.\n\nA story - Son gets nabbed, theres a door in a hole. Right now, the story is still in the works and I expect it will be all the way up to release. but, little things are released here and there that really  make you want more.\n\nBuilding - Matched with a horror atmosphere, this is done really well. You build with wood, sticks and stones. You can lay a blueprint for a pre-built structure or build something unique piece by piece. You can build in the tree tops or out in the ocean..both have their positives and negatives. Building a base will keep out the night but there is no promise of safety as things can still find a way in.\n\n\n\nTruely, a game I love.", "timestamp_created": 1472806152, "timestamp_updated": 1472806913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.83133399486541748", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "47446312": {"recommendationid": "47446312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262486794", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 21446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1544984088}, "language": "english", "review": "This game needs no words...

And so we hoped to be settled. On the first night we did encounter some enemies, beaten them fairly easily, not much special.\n\nBut as the days progress, unexpected things start to happen.

It started off with many bugs, but has come a LONG way! The reasons I like this game:\n1) The AI: The AI is extremely impressive. The natives apparently climb up trees (I say apparently because I have not seen it myself), have hunting parties and scouts, are creepy and it's hard to predict their next move. E.G I encountered a group of 3 natives once, and they ran around me and made some form of a triangular shape around me. I went forward to one of them who backed away. Then I turned to another one who dashed forward, and instead of attacking me like I thought they would, they stopped closer to me, where I then attacked them. This time one of the others came at me from behind and the other made a load roar/shrieking sound alerting their friends of my presence. The hit from behind stunned my character and I was brought down by the natives.\n2) The Atmosphere: The game produces an eerie atmosphere, especially at night. When I hear a native laughing or screaming it sends me running to my base, or hiding from them wherever I can. Even when there are no natives around, I'm still at the ready, as I never know when I might come across a native hunting party.\n3) The Graphics: For an indie game the graphics are amazing! The light coming through the leaves is a nice touch. The graphics are stunning for an indie game. End of.\n4) The Gameplay: Now the most important part of the game. The gameplay. I do like good graphics but when there's good gameplay ,good graphics aren't NEEDED (THIS DOES NOT MEAN EITHER OR. I LIKE BOTH TOGETHER!). The game is a great mix of horror and survival, not making it like a horror game where you find a few cool items and nothing else, but at the same time not making it like a hardcore survival game with some enemies, hardly capable of stopping you. It balances the two just right. It is best to gather resources to build a base, and then look for resources to make more tools to aid my fight against the natives. There are still a few unique tools, that cannot be crafted, but I won't say what they are because you might  want to find out for yourself and get a great feeling when you find them. The natives are powerful, creepy and terrifying. Now scores!\nThe AI: I think they are a great enemy to have in the game, and this is in an alpha build! Some little glitches but overall they're great. 9.5/10\nThe Atmosphere: It's eerie and suits the game perfectly! I like a good atmosphere in a game, and The Forest really deserves a mention for the atmosphere it creates. Obviously co-op is a little less scary, but they can probably find a way to make it a creepy a singleplayer. 9/10\nThe Graphics: The graphics are brilliant for an indie game, but there is room for some improvement. Also playermodels are limited but who really cares what you look like in a game? 8.5/10\nThe Gameplay: The atmosphere and the gameplay work very well together. Obviously some room for improvement. 9/10\nOverall: I've had so much fun playing The Forest. I will have a lot more fun playing The Forest. The game is a great game overall. It has many elements to it, and will still get better... 9.5/10\nP.S I don't really write reviews for games, but The Forest definetely deserved one.", "timestamp_created": 1460719848, "timestamp_updated": 1460719848, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.810265064239501953", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18392943": {"recommendationid": "18392943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002858112", "num_games_owned": 812, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549531321}, "language": "english", "review": "You either die to the cannibals, or you live long enough to see yourself become one.", "timestamp_created": 1444381055, "timestamp_updated": 1444381055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 211, "votes_funny": 158, "weighted_vote_score": "0.88615649938583374", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "41802319": {"recommendationid": "41802319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067988534", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1544477646}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is criminally under-priced for what you get.\nI've had this since very early alpha, but would happily have paid \u00a330 for it.\nAt \u00a315.49 without being on sale, this is just straight out a must buy for anybody into the crafting/survival genre.\n\nThe Forest and Subnautica are unarguably the top of their field.", "timestamp_created": 1525209004, "timestamp_updated": 1525209004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 120, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.842072129249572754", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47883920": {"recommendationid": "47883920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289609409", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550017907}, "language": "english", "review": "So, i completed the game in 18 hours with friends.\nThe pluses of this game are: \n-An interesting story with the caves\n-Multiplayer\n-Nice building system\n-atmosphere, its terrifying how you explore the caves on singleplayer.\nbut.. here are the things i dont like\n-the fighting system\n-multiplayer optimalization\nand thats all basically.\nthe game ran on like 30 fps even though my computer sucks, so thats not really bad\nthanks for taking your time to read my dumbass review, now goodbye.", "timestamp_created": 1545965220, "timestamp_updated": 1545965331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 137, "votes_funny": 46, "weighted_vote_score": "0.867055952548980713", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32816980": {"recommendationid": "32816980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070750782", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547908108}, "language": "english", "review": ">start with a friend\n>pick up supplies, build a hut, nothing unusual\n>find cannibals the second night, kill them \n>find more cannibals next day, kill them\n>lol too easy\n>over the course of 14 days we cut down trees during day and cannibals during night\n>hear strange sounds on the 15th night, grab our clubs to get to bashing heads as usual\n>come across some fucking rhino-cow-human hybrid along with some dude with enough arm/tentacles to star in japanese porn\n>friend attacks them, gets killed in 0.2 seconds\n>hide in our hut\n>hut is destroyed in 0.3 seconds\n>die\n10/10 would go on massive killing spree again", "timestamp_created": 1498487540, "timestamp_updated": 1498487540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 463, "votes_funny": 401, "weighted_vote_score": "0.886590659618377686", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28968146": {"recommendationid": "28968146", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987394736", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 96142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2097, "last_played": 1551866734}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best survival games out.

HOWEVER, and this is a really big HOWEVER, hence the caps. The different core functions that create the game (Physics, AI, Crafting, Environment, Survival, Graphics) are impressive in their construction. They have used some of the top add-ins for unity to speed up the games creation and improve the complexity of several core systems, and built on top of that base to create the alpha we are playing now. It is likely the integration of these systems so that they work together in unison is the reason for the initial release delays. Likely the graphical side.\n\nThe bits we really care about, Items, AI, Crafting, Survival Mechanics and World interaction are all setup in such a way that adding new things, improving current stuff or replacing parts entirely is easy from a coding perspective, thanks to the methods they use to pass information and trigger functions across entities in the game world.\n\nMost of what we are experiencing in the Alpha is what I call place-holder code. Simple versions of what the function should do once it has been developed. Just enough code so that the function will not crash the game, or another function if it is called. SO MANY functions do not even have code written for them. They do nothing when or if they are even called.\nSome areas are of course further developed than others. Building structures and crafting is quite fleshed out fundamentally, the AI is all ready for family based societies and most of the complex roaming and searching code is not being used. Combat is not even their really. being able to collide with things and pass functions calls allows the simplistic fighting and moving we have in the game, and I seriously think this will be replaced entirely.\n\nMy guess is that the first few patches will be stability and integration patches. These will improve the functions in the areas most reported and further integrate the different add-ins with their own code, and finally customizing those add-ins further to support the game they want to create. Further content, like additional craftables and buildables, and more complex AI (like family society) will probably not come until another patch or two has past. Depending on the assets they have ready now, and the complexity of how those are used in game, we will see a handful of craftables, items or buildings added in any patch, but big content will be later. We are likely to see movement, collision, combat and item interaction improve dramatically in the next two patches, as well as performance increases and general stability.\n\nI also assume that the integration of these add ins, and customizing them would be quite complex and time consuming. Working with other peoples code can be time consuming and unpredictable until you are as familiar with that code as you would be your own. These add-ins are not simple little modules, they are advanced highly developed and quite complex systems. As time passes, the dev's will get more and more familiar with the coding of these, and development speed will increase.\n\nI found no evidence (in my mind) that suggested any aspect of what they advertised was false or misleading as far as what the game is becoming. In fact the code suggests that the game is going to be a lot more than what we know already.

Its getting dark now and I know now that im not alone. I'm not sure of these tribesmen's intentions but Its starting to rain and I need to build a shelter. I'm going to the woods to collect some logs.\n\nJournal Entry 4 \n\nWhile heading back with a fresh cut log I noticed multiple lit torches heading towards my camp, about 12 of them from what I counted, Indeed it appears there are many more tribesmen than I originally thought. They appear to be scanning my camp looking for survivors.\n\nJournal Entry 5 \n\nAfter observing the tribesmen for 10 or so mins I approached one of the females of the pack, she stared at me in shock for about 30 seconds then screamed and ran away. She did not attack... perhaps they are a friendly people after all! \n\nJournal Entry 6 \n\nI should have just left them alone, apparently the female ran back to get the rest of the tribe.... I was attacked and chased, I was able to kill three of them before accidentally backing up off a cliff and falling to (what I thought was my death). \n\nJournal Entry 7 \n\nI have awoken in a cave of hanging bodies, I am badly injured from my cliff fall and only have my terribly lit Bic lighter to guide my way through the cave.... this may be my last journal entry as I am starving and going to die soon....
