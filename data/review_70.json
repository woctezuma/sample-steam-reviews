I owed it all to its well-crafted bizzaro environment that is Black Mesa - and all of it's lovely bullet-spongey creatures within it. Weapons and graphics are clearly outshined in this day and age, but it just has a seamless sense of progression hindered only by loading screens. It's still a must buy for anyone who wants to see where the origins of this game began. If the old graphics put you off, I'd suggest getting Black Mesa, which is just a prettier re-skin of the game that's a bit more current gen. \n\nStory: [spoiler] Gordon Freeman, a 27-year-old Physics wunderkind, is running late in his super-secret research position at Black Mesa. Black Mesa is a research compound that does a bunch of scientifically kooky stuff, which you'll get a taste of on your tram ride over. Once you're at work, an experiment you're involved goes bad and the whole place goes out of sorts. It has something to do with dicking time, space, and the Xen dimension which hosts many upset aliens. You're tasked with maintaining order as you fight Aliens that have teleported in from the Xen dimension while also going up against military personnel tasked with killing the remaining scientists and aliens to cover it all up. Eventually, you make your way through to the Xen dimension to kill a big alien that's keeping the portal open. Once you do that, this weird guy in a suit that you see in a few fleeting moments teleports to you and says that he has work for you. And if you don't accept his new offer of employment by walking to a teleport, you get teleported into a big room of enemies without a gun. [/spoiler]\n\n\n++ Phenomenal environmental design that withstands the test of time\n++ Outstanding 90s synth soundtrack \n++ Diverse array of enemies and environmental obstacles that added that extra level of challenge \n++ Great weapon variety with adequate ammunition scattered throughout the levels \n+ Barebones story that's kept interesting through dialogue from the scientists\n- Military enemies were bullet-sponges that should have been easier to kill\n- Falling damage was a bit much for what it was \n-- Extremely disappointing final boss in terms of methods on how to kill it\n\n\nConclusion: Buy it now or during a sale. Get Black Mesa if you can't stand the graphics. Shows the early capabilities of Valve in full force, and it was cool to see how certain gameplay elements shaped the many great things that came from this game (i.e. the original Counter Strike, Portal, and many other games that drew inspiration from it).", "timestamp_created": 1549915564, "timestamp_updated": 1549915564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647036612033843994", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48904800": {"recommendationid": "48904800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117979335", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549813273}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was amazing, Amazing story\n\nSo when half-life 3?", "timestamp_created": 1549813928, "timestamp_updated": 1551336981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583090364933013916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48976911": {"recommendationid": "48976911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277762584", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550024367}, "language": "english", "review": "Even though Half-Life is more than 20 years old, it's fun to play and provides a unique game experience.

I was completely wrong and while Half-Life certainly has fairly bland graphics and visual palettes by some standards, it's still artistically appeasing to look at, particularly in the intro but even the level designs and contrasts of later levels are striking at times and the physics engine is no longer impressive by todays standards, but strengthens the gameplay rather than being a dependent part of it.\n\nWhat all this means is that this game hasn't aged in terms of fun gameplay and has barely aged in terms of visual style and it still felt impressive to play through. I'm sad I didn't get a chance when it came out, but I haven't missed out and I'll be revisiting this game every few years to come.\n\nIf you're one of the handful of people on the planet like me and visiting this game for the first time more than a decade and a half later- don't delay, the first play-through is every bit as fun, thrilling and impressive as it was on release.", "timestamp_created": 1482999710, "timestamp_updated": 1482999710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.85906982421875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31944305": {"recommendationid": "31944305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207583911", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498411872}, "language": "english", "review": "VALVe's first major hit, and the game that got the company off the ground.

That snowy afternoon of late '99. I was sick in bed, spewing blood after the surgery.  I could barely see things with that giant eyepatch the doctors gave me. One of the kids lined up for lunch told me there was a big event in the gaming world, something revolutionary. Well, we were little at the time, so he didnt mention \"revolution\", but he clearly told me it was damn awesome. I wasnt much into computer games at the time (always been a Nintendo guy). In that particular instance tho, I'd have done anything to subside the pain and boredom, so when he invited me in his room to play games I accepted. We played a bit of \"On a rail\" so I basically spoiled myself six or seven maps. From that day, we played almost continuously until we finished the game. Then I started it again to see what I missed. And then, a third time. \nAnd a fourth. ... yes, you get the idea. Half Life got me back on track; the immersion was near total, the very first time a game had given me that kind of feel. Gordon was me, and I was Gordon. The scientists interaction, the scripted sequences, the great AI and the impeccable pacing of the game made me fall in love not just with Half Life but with PC gaming entirely. It opened up a portal, if you will, on this vast and expanding world. Since its launch I have played it 320 times, and I've always had it installed in any system I purchased, and I'll always keep installing it, like a badge of pride.\n\nBut not only do I owe HL my gaming life, and a steady recovery after destiny kicked me in the face, but also my passion for creating things. Modding HL was a chore, a pleasure, a pain, a terrific prospect; it almost made me cry at night after countless times failing to compile that one map I spent days working on, but then when I succeeded I'd be the happiest kid in the world. \nI've spent years figuring things out, mastering WorldCraft, and then Hammer, and then the HL SDK and the 3D programs made to export and import SMD formats; sadly I was too late to the party to truly shine, but I can now say, I am modding HL in 2018, and I have mastered it.\nTo this day, I still make maps, models, textures.... stories. Half Life taught me to dream in pixels, and concretize what I want to make, what I want to tell people. Visualize, focus, manipulate, apply. Is there anything better than that? Is there truly anything more valuable than being able to produce something meaningful from your own dreams? I dont think there is.\nHalf Life gavve me that creative spark, set in motion a little gilmmer of hope that anyone, no matter how impaired, could still bring something to the table and be competitive \\ challenging in some form or another.\nSo in conclusion, for me Half Life is more than a game, more than an experience, more than what the average gamer would consider a great starting point. I feel it has hit closer to home than any other game, for the simple reason that it was a whole new world to explore, and at the time I discovered it, it was all the rage with its multiple modding teams creating beauty out of nothing. It was a time of plentiful dreams to be had and many more to make. It was also a much simplier time: three people could band together and do something great, with amazing tools.\nI wish the gaming industry could've stayed there a little longer. The awesomeness never seemed to end. But it did, as with all things. Now many have moved on.... but not me. At least in this little corner of the internet, I do not wish to move.\nI salute you Valve, thank you for everything. As you've freezed Gordon in perpetual sleep, I will follow - figuratively speaking - for as long as Time will allow, and I'll keep the torch lit.\n\nI am modding Half Life in 2018. Like me, many others have not yet given up. \nKeep creating, perfecting the tools that were given to us. Keep improving our modding capabilities, and allow us to express ourselves. This is our infinite canvas; as long as you'll be dreaming of new exciting adventures, we will dream with you.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1545228313, "timestamp_updated": 1545228313, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 82, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.87757408618927002", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14408476": {"recommendationid": "14408476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063586802", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423451396}, "language": "english", "review": "If you've never played a Half-Life game and aren't relatively familiar with the story and franchise, then this review might be for you. If you're just looking for a fresh perspective on one of your favorite classics then this review might also be for you. This was the first time I have ever played a Half-Life game. I'm afraid I missed it when it was released, however, I did play similar shooters from that era. I didn't think a review from me would be necessary for such a popular title like Half-Life but seeing that all of the top reviews for it are those ridiculous one or two sentence jokes, I thought that maybe my take on it would be welcome.\n\nIn Half-Life, you fill the shoes of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who's getting ready for an ordinary day at the office. Gordon Freeman apparently, dons his fancy HEV suit every morning after punching in on the time clock, and then runs around in a room that is not safe anyone not wearing said suit.\n\nLong story short, something bad happens while on the job, and aliens decide to invade Gordon's workplace, Black Mesa labs. You then spend the rest of the game trying to get out of the now compromised Black Mesa facility. The structure is surprisingly large for a research lab and you'll spend quite some time traversing it's different levels, from labyrinthine industrial machinery to the sterile, clean laboratories where Freeman's colleagues go-a-sciencing. Without spoiling too much, the army becomes involved and for some unexplained reason, presumably a cover-up, considers you to be just as dangerous as the invading aliens.\n\nThat pretty much covers it, as far as an overall picture is concerned. You won't start with much, as far as weapons are concerned, however you'll slowly build up your collection as you romp through Black Mesa. The gameplay is smooth and uncluttered with too many bells and whistles. You run, shoot, and jump your way to the surface of the facility. Sometimes, you'll even push and pull some things to solve some very mild puzzles. The game can be quite challenging if you up the difficulty enough. And ammo is at a premium. You really have to think about what weapons you're using against which enemies and what is the most efficient way to kill them. Some weapons are better for killing different targets, which is a nice thing that makes this game more than just a mindless shooter.\n\nThere is little dialogue throughout this game. In fact, there are even a couple of levels where you won't encounter too terribly many enemies, however those are mostly reserved for the more industrial areas of Black Mesa.\n\nThe game is definitely dated, as it runs on the old 1998 GldSrc engine. If you're itching to get your nostalgia on, this can be a good thing, though. It reminded me a lot of Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force from the early 2000's (unsurprisingly, as Raven Software admitted Half-Life was their inspiration for Elite Force). It can also be considered reminiscent of Doom, in it's tone, especially in the later levels I think. If you really just aren't in the mood of '98 graphics, thought, you could always get the Source version of the game, which isn't terribly different, but does give it that extra little oomph you may be looking for.\n\nAll in all, there weren't many cons in this game for me, except for it's lack of exposition. I think that may be more of a sign of it's age, however. Like I said, there isn't much dialogue and if you're looking for a lot of story, you won't really find it in this game. However, I've been told that HL2 has more of that sort of thing. I also mentioned above that ammo can be hard to find and many might consider that to be another negative trait. That's just something that will come down to personal preference, though. At least I never found myself bored while playing. The end boss was pretty unforgiving, though. The technical difficulty of defeating the final boss was fairly frustrating and they didn't exactly make the mechanics of doing it very smooth. This also seems to be a relic from gaming's past, though.\n\nAll things considered, I really enjoyed this game. I came it with mostly a fresh perspective, as I knew little about the tone of Half-Life and I knew little of the story. Even though I never played this as a kid, the nostalgia from shooters of it's era was enough to make me smile from time to time. If you played Quake III or games like it, you might also notice some of the minor similarities.

It is revered to this day, and played by millions of people. It's engine and modding tools revolutionized independent game making as we knew it. \nCounter Strike had its start as a mod for Half-Life. The port of Team Fortress known as Team Fortress Classic kept the dream alive, and expansion packs like Opposing Forces and Blue Shift let you continue the battle through Black Mesa from a different point of view. \n\nHalf-Life also gave birth to other popular mods as well. The Specialist brought John Woo like gun play to a multiplayer stage, but also with one guy who always tried to use the Katana. Sven Co-op was advertised as a way to play Half-Life story mode with friends but ended up with countless community maps, anywhere from puzzles to remake maps from other games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill. \n\nNatural Selection mixed RTS and science fiction horror with competitive multiplayer, Brainbread predated the multiplayer zombie craze by a few years. And also Frontline Force existed. I don't know what it was, I only ever heard it was good. \n\nAlso, does anyone remember the Dragon Ball Z mod? People modded the mod, that was rad. \n\nOh yeah, I should probably talk about the real game. \n\nParanoia is good, too. \n\nHalf Life was published by Sierra until it wasn't anymore. You play as Gordon Freeman, the world's silentist man. One day at work, Gordon decides to ruin everything by pushing a big rock into a plasma globe. This opens up a portal into New Jersey, which promptly invades the world with horrible aliens and other baddies. \n\nAlso the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit division of the Marine Corp also show up and they're also rather disappointed with you. So its up to Gordon to hit things with a crowbar, shoot things with guns, and jump from platform to platform in some sketchy platforming sequences. \n\nI'm not a believer in the idea that video games can \u201cage well\u201d or not \u201cage well\u201d, I mean, I still play games from the 90s on a regular basis and I have fun with them. I've had people tell me the same thing about Half-Life, how its just not as good now because newer games have come out. But Half-Life not only holds up, it actually kind of stomps a good number of recent games into the mud. \n\nHalf-Life mixes slow, ambient moments with fast paced, Quake-like action expertly. Giving you times when you're simply exploring the facility, solving simple puzzles, and finding hidden areas before throwing you into a all-out shit show with either aliens, marines, or both. \n\nThe amount of diversity in the alien forces is actually kind of amazing. Headcrabs, zombies, bullsquids, barnacles, Vortigaunt, alien grunt, and of course, who could forget the Chumtoad? They're not just different enemies with different attacks either, each one has their own behavior patterns. \n\nHeadcrabs like to hide in the ceiling and around corners, Vortigaunts will flee if they take too much damage,  Houndeyes will group up together so they can do more damage with their attacks, you can actually feed Bullsquids meat on some occasions, and I don't speak Headcrab Zombie, but I think they're saying mean things about you.\n\nThe Marines are no slouch either. They'll cover fire, flank, flush you out with explosives, retreat if it gets too hot, even cover one another's retreat. They're mostly the same, as in their basically just another enemy, but they mix it up with carrying different weapons. The one's carrying the submachine gun will try to keep their distance while the shotgun toting marines have no problems getting in close and turning your insides into outsides. They'll even give you a little kick if you get too close. \n\nYou mix all this together with pretty excellent gun play and you got yourself a good shooter, pard'ner. Half-Life's combat is fast and crazy enough to keep you on your toes, while cover is a viable option, its usually best to just go crazy, sprinting and strafing into battle, using your assortment of weapons to the fullest.\n\nEach weapons plays a role, especially in later areas of the game, and switching from, lets say, the shotgun to turn someone into mulch before quickly drawing the crossbow to hit someone from a distance isn't only viable, but it feels good to pull off.\nOoh, I'm getting tingly. \n\nTo me, the earliest parts of Half-Life are it's strongest. Exploring a work place turned alien infestation has a enticing atmosphere, like finding a gun on a train track. The slow, quiet moments which lead into showdowns with the alien invaders are buffered with parts where you find fellow scientists and security guards. \n\nThen you find your first Marine and the game suddenly goes BOOM, KAPOW! And you're thrust into a warzone with artillery and very angry men calling you very bad words. All of these start to mingle together into one chaotic mess, and its amazing. Finding security guards holding their own in between aliens and marines brutalizing one another is always a treat, especially if they have goodies to give you. \n\nThe game does peter out as it goes on. If I had to put a point to it it would probably be when [spoiler] Gordon gets tossed into the trash compactor. [/spoiler] \nFrom then on out its basically all action with very little interaction with survivors or puzzle solving. Since you're getting further away from the usually populated areas, you're less likely to find others that aren't actively trying to kill you. Exploration also takes a nose dive, since you're basically just trying to get across one giant warzone at this point until you reach your destination. \nThat being said, when you DO run into a Barney or a scientist, its more impressive than anything else.\nOh yeah, and the last few stages can leave me alone and stop calling me, please. \n\nHalf-Life holds a special place in my heart. The collection was the first thing I ever bought for the PC back in 2003. The game itself, including all the really well made mods basically meant you only needed to buy that one game. \nIts also the reason why I have a VAC ban on my account. Bet you can't guess what I diiiid.\n[spoiler]It actually wasn't me. [/spoiler]\n\nThe game is great fun, and you can usually get it for a buck or so these days. The game is also compressed to hell when you download it, so you could get it in like...An hour if you have dial up.\nPlease tell me you don't have dial-up. \n\nHalf-Life gets a thumbs up out of a series of thumbs down. \n\nCats apparently domesticated themselves.\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/7124597/]Join the curator, where we totally don't practice witchcraft on new members.

It surely is an important game and many refer to it as the best game ever made, but Half-Life does have it's flaws as well. I'll start off with the positive. \n\nMost of the games at the time didn't have much depth in the story. Mainly, you simply had to run and shoot and the story felt irrelevant, but in Half-Life it was different. The story is quite the usual - an experiment goes wrong and it creates a portal to another planet which allows hostile aliens to go through. Eventhough it seems nothing much, you can always feel that there's more depth put into the story. The pacing is perfect and the world you are playing in is still interesting to look at. The level design is amazing and it does hold up today, even if some of the levels may feel a bit too long. All of the weapons are unique and have use for them. All of them are useful in certain situations. There's also a big variety on how to defeat your enemy.\n\nThe multi-player is still being played today and you'll be able to find servers, but I'd suggest looking up servers on internet, since there's a bigger choice. Multi-player is a fast-paced deathmatch which requires a lot of skill and patience. Concept is pretty simple, but actually getting good at it is hard. If there was a game that plays similliar, I would say Quake, but HL can be a bit slower at times. Maps are well designed and it's still a fun experience, but I'd suggest finishing the story first, because it's where the real beauty of the game is. \n\nSo, there aren't many things to say about Half-Life's flaws. One of the biggest issues is that the soldiers will most likely hit you most of the time, because they are not designed to miss their shots as much. You have to kill them as fast as possible, just so you won't catch as many bullets. On the other hand, other enemies don't do this. Also the levels drag on too much sometimes. Some of the levels feel too long and it might be a little irritating if you are playing the first time. The levels where you have to jump on platforms aren't something I'd like to play through either, but hey, maybe you enjoy that. \n\nOverall, Half-Life still holds up today despite it's age and I can see why people, including me, still play it and it's mods today. If you can't decide whether you should pick Half-Life or Half-Life: Source, I'd say that you should definitely go for the original. The new gun models, textures etc. doesn't make the game feel balanced. It's like your stuck between an old and a new game. Also, Source version does not have as many mods, so go for the original.", "timestamp_created": 1440106750, "timestamp_updated": 1498829010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 123, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.847843647003173828", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45895197": {"recommendationid": "45895197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316016059", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549824531}, "language": "english", "review": "Happy twentieth anniversary, Half-life.

Today, I'm speaking about Half-Life, a Valve game which was first released in 1998 and had more than 50 rewards. By most players, this game was considered as a highly atmospheric, greatly built, and amazingly drawn. It also has awesome storyline and multiplayer, so if you don't care about graphics, which were brilliant in 1998, then this game is for you. Complexity of the game levels, hidden secrets, alternate paths, 5 categories of weapons (14 weapons in total), different kinds of friends and enemies will give you as much pleasure as if you got quite a rich man. In my opinion, Half-Life deserves all the rewards it was given, and will stay the best game I've ever played until the end of my days.

With that said, although I consider Half-Life as a classical MASTERPIECE and possibly one of the greatest games of all time, I will still list down game mechanics from the past that some people may not enjoy today.\n\nThink of it like this: everyone enjoys flying modern-day commercial jets like the 747, but it doesn't mean however that everyone would like to fly in a DC-3 built in the 1940s despite it being labeled as the 'most significant transport aircraft' in history.\n\n[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]\nHalf-Life is a narrative-driven linear first-person shooter (FPS) action game and is the debut (and signature) title of Valve.  Hailed as one of the greatest games of all time winning dozens of awards on release, Half-Life revolutionized the FPS genre in a way that no other title has done since Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake. This game has since been the industry standard on how to make a perfect FPS game which combines realistic gameplay, fun puzzles mechanics, a narrative-driven single-player experience with fast-paced multiplayer action.\n\nThe game follows the story of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist working for the Black Mesa Research Facility that is involved in Weapons Development, Research on Teleportation Technology and occasional cloning of a Security Guard named Barney Calhoun.  When an experiment with an unknown alien crystal results in a catastrophic accident that opened a portal to an alien dimension named 'Xen', Gordon Freeman, wearing the H.E.V. Suit, must now travel across the entire Black Mesa facility to reach the Lambda Complex where he must enter a portal to Xen and kill the creature that is keeping the portal open for the alien invaders. Fight against Invading alien monsters and, at the same time, US Military operatives who are attempting to stop the invasion but is also trying to silence any surviving 'witnesses' of the Black Mesa incident.\n\n[h1]LEGACY OF HALF-LIFE (PROS):[/h1]\n+ First FPS game to fully incorporate a Narrative-Driven story (as opposed to the industry standard of maze gallery shooters which was the Wolfenstein 3D / Doom mechanic)\n+ Excellent level designs\n+ Realistic combat mechanics (may be not as realistic now in 2015, but 17 years ago it was)\n+ Fun puzzles\n+ Great sound effects\n+ First FPS game to incorporate scripted sequences for its level transitions rather than cut-scenes\n+ Relatively advanced AI (back in 1998), with enemies actively dodging, tactically retreating and often times baiting you into an ambush.\n+ Fun fast-paced multiplayer action that set the foundations for Counter-Strike which started as a mere mod of Half-Life\n+ Mods; although Half-Life is not the first video game to be modded, it is the first to have several such mods become their own full games that still retain their Half-Life heritage\n+ Challenging difficulty modes (but this is a given since most old-school shooters were challenging)\n\n[h1]OLD GAME MECHANICS THAT NEW GENERATION OF GAMERS MAY NOT LIKE (CONS):[/h1]\n- Perpetual sprint with optional walking by pressing \u201cShift\u201d (as opposed to today's standard which is the reverse)\n- No objective tracker (players may forget what they were doing especially if they haven't played in a while)\n- Melee weapon needs to be equipped rather than bound to a hotkey (though CS:GO players won't have a problem with this)\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n[b][u]MASTERPIECE[/u][/b] is the only word that best describes Half-Life in my opinion.  Although some of its mechanics may not necessarily be applicable in today's (2015) standard, the same can still be considered as part of its charm, much like how most of us still enjoy watching old-school movies and TV shows.\n\n[h1]WORTH IT?:[/h1]\n[b]MUST BUY AND MUST HAVE[/b]. I, however, do recommend you purchase the Half-Life Anthology if you already have Half-Life 2 but if you don't have it, get Half-Life Complete.\n\n[h1]ADDITIONAL INFO (Not necessary for the review):[/h1]\nThe advent of Half-Life was a turning point in gaming history, most notably, the First-person shooter genre.  Before this game, the only FPS standard to be followed was Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake, with the first two being plotless maze shooters and Quake being the first to implement a backstory but still retained the maze-like levels. With Half-Life, developers saw a potential for FPS games to combine intense action and gunplay with effective narrative story-telling through leniar levels (which is heavily abused by some FPS games today) and realistic game mechanics (a title, which most people agree, was held by the Metal Gear Solid franchise, a third-person action game)\n\nLet\u2019s put this in an analogy: Wolfenstein 3D is the Wheel (basically invented the mainstream FPS genre), Doom is the Horse-Drawn Carriage (Doom made FPS games extremely popular, accessible and widespread), Quake is the Steam Engine (Quake bridge the gap between plotless maze shooters and  plot driven FPS games [i]Credit: Steam User RGX12 for pointing this out[/i]) and Half-Life is the Ford Model T Car (Half-Life set the standard for modern day FPS games who's basic and essential features still survives today.)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n[h1]Like my Reviews?

Well, for me, it has to be the visual world that captures the core of our imaginations. And with this little gem called Half-Life, it comes as no exception that this game continues to boggle the mind and leave gamers alike wondering. There is more heart, creativity and scientific ingenuity there is in this one title than there is in most series and is arguably Valve's greatest achievement. With over 50 game awards, it's a strong justification. Half-Life isn't just one of the greatest FPS' games of all time. Half-Life isn't literally one of the best purchases you can ever get on Steam. Half-Life is quite simply, one of the greatest games ever made.\n\nWhen compared to certain FPS' games in the past and todays time, which both heavily rely on long-winded cutscenes to present the main narrative of the game, Half-Life annihilates this often compulsed aspect, by detailing the plotlines that keeps the player still in control of the first-person viewpoint, leaving the cutscenes rolling while you still have full access to the gameplay and character controllability. For summarization, You will see through the eyes of Gordon Freeman at all times.\n\nThe game is a perpetual maze; leaving the player to work at tasks that involve being locked into battle and overall puzzle solving to advance through the many challenges that wait up ahead. Most of the time, the story illuminates the puzzles by the actions to proceed, such as maze scenarios and building boxes to use as staircases. Although Half-Life has short-lived loading screens from time to time after leaving a certain area for a new one, the game has no levels. But, to make up for this traditional concept, the game is split into a number of mind-boggling chapters filled with rich story and easy adaptability.\n\nTo start off with this game's story, you're none other than Gordon Freeman. A young man who holds a Ph.D in theoretical physics who starts his daily grind back at the Black Mesa Research Facility; a fictional complex that is stranded in a remote desert located in the suburbs of New Mexico. Arriving late for work yet again, you take the tram system around the Black Mesa Research Facility and at this point, objectives that his game has fulfilled such as breath-taking visuals and movie quality animation begins to blossom. The tram sequence at the beginning of the game can only be summed up in one word; Incredible. It's as if the things that come flying at you from every angle and position, almost reminiscent of watching an action-packed movie, along with the credits of the producer's names proudly fading in and out on the corner of the screen.\n\nAs you make your first step in the heavily secured facility, you're constantly reminded that you put on your Hazardous Environmental suit, or the H.E.V suit for short. While all things are hunky-dory, those things soon turn to the worst very soon. After a failed experiment, involving a collision between a rare intergalactic specimen from another dimension with an Anti-Mass Spectrometer, the Black Mesa facility falls in ruins, meaning you are one of the only key survivors of the infamous ''Black Mesa Incident''. And with this, alien life-forms from the dimension of ''Xen'' are pulled from their dimension into ours and are running amok the ruined facility, along with the Army that storm the place after the gone, haywired facility's emergency call has been echoed. This of course doesn't make things any easier and you soon find yourself battling both the aliens and the military.\n\nWhile there isn't exactly much to complain about, I would admit that guiding the chickened-out scientists and professors around the facility can be quite a pain now and again due to some seldom poor AI programming, as well as the alien life-form, Vortigaunt, from which you would have to wait and be patient for them to wreck down wooden doors in front of you, as you are not capable of doing that yourself. (You do start off with a crowbar, right?) As well as I'm probably not the only one who made the same mistake by killing them through a small opening, before they did in fact begin to tear down the doors. But then again, this is where the used scripted intermissions started to show, so that's an added bonus to the magnitude of the game.\n\nFor the long run, I've had fun and joy both reviewing this amazing game and playing this amazing game. If you haven't play Half-Life or even worse, not familiar with Half-Life, it's still a big compulsory  recommendation from me.", "timestamp_created": 1408390212, "timestamp_updated": 1445790555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 197, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.875146389007568359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12373802": {"recommendationid": "12373802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133778731", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412511849}, "language": "english", "review": "You get to play as a mute theoretical physicist who wrecks havoc upon firearms specialists, and aliens from an alternative dimension with a crowbar.", "timestamp_created": 1412504259, "timestamp_updated": 1412504259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 211, "votes_funny": 210, "weighted_vote_score": "0.868073463439941406", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40523928": {"recommendationid": "40523928", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974630555", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519834428}, "language": "english", "review": "I first played this game in 1998.

gem.I don't vote games by their graphics,but by their gameplay.This was an immersing,wonderful and addicting experience for me.I lived another life.In this game.The game has everything a gamer asks for: Immersing Gameplay,Indulging story,A Nice Selection of Weapons,and graphics that were thrilling in the year it was made,but are all old now.Even now this title holds up till today,shining its glory as the first game that Valve ever made,and a game that changed Gaming itself.Now I will have a look at the main aspects of a good game.\n\nWARNING: A little bit of spoiling ahead.\n\nGameplay: Excellent.Either you are blasting monsters from an alternate dimension or just trying to pick off those squad men who just don't seem to put you in peace.There were a few places where it did get a little bit boring,but that was because I couldn't wait until I would experience something new.The terrain in the game is nicely made,even though it is pretty old due to the date it was made.The places you travel through are pretty different,you won't be bored of seeing the same old place over and over again.The game itself is nicely balanced;except that they could have put less ammo in the game,so you wouldn't always have a gun loaded. 9/10\n\nStory: A nice story is told throughout the game,and that is guaranteed to keep you hooked until the last moment of the game.Even though it doesn't have any cutscenes,it tells its story just wonderfully.It keeps you in first person mode all of the time,so it makes you \"live\" the character all the way through the story.All the stuff that is happening in the game seems kind of logical,as if could happen in real life.The characters are well done as well,for they act as normal people would act.They are as they should be,they speak,fight,help you and do other stuff.And there is a wierdly acting character which stands out in the game;but I will let you figure that out for yourself.There aren't the same scientists all over and over again,but we can't say this with security guards.The enemies are widely assorted and won't make you think that they are dumb,but play as they are real and trying to get you.No dull moment will get you in this game,so don't be afraid of experiencing any in this game.  10/10\n\nWeapons: There is a wide assort of weapons to fit you in this game,but do not expect too much.There are the main weapons you would except from a game like this,and maybe a little bit more due to an \"Monster Invasion\" going on all around you.The game has its own signature weapon: A Crowbar.But that is also the only melee weapon that you can use in this game.While you progress through the game you will find weapons,but there aren't many,so every weapon you get,you make use of,because all of them are unique.As I won't spoil much here,I will just tell you that there are weapons from the pistol even to such weapons like a rocket launcher,and a few of alien techologies are found in the game as well.You will find yourself exploring all around you to get some ammo for your favourite weapon,because it gives you tons of ammo for a wide selection of weapons,and the ammo that you need may not be findable anywhere.When you shoot a gun it feels like you shoot a gun,meaning that you will find the gun bouncing back in your hand when you shoot it,and you can hear the sound for gun firing is well done as well.But when shooting a rocket launcher you will not bounce back,but if you move while shooting it the rocket will go wrong and hit another spot,depending on which way you moved.Even if you don't have any ammo,you get to use a alien techonlogy which has unlimited ammo.Even though it recharges over time,it doesn't take much of it and it has special abilities.  8.5/10\n\nEnemies: From the headcrab even to the final boss,the enemies are nicely balanced.You are slowly introduced to each enemy and its tactics,so you know what to use on it and what to do.You probably won't find yourself facing a unnormally big army of enemies if you aren't well armed.Once you learn the tactics the enemies use it is easy to defeat them,just keep a look out for them,or otherwise you might find yourself in quite a pickle.I wouldn't say that the enemies are hard.You can use the terrain to your advantage as well.Luckily,one group of your enemies is fighting another,so you can use that to your advantage as well,if you find the right moment.*wink*.But I wouldn't rely on such stuff,I would just get myself a nice arsenal of weapons and go defeat that crowd of motherfuckers.There are a few weapons which have unlimited ammo,and I feel that is unbalanced.Don't go prancing around as a pony as well,you will get your ass kicked.There are flying enemies,crawling enemies,walking enemies and big enemies.The crawling ones are easy,just keep a look out for them so they don't get the jump on you.The Flying ones need the right weapons,like a zoom in crossbow,for they fly around and shoot at you and when you get close to them they just fly away.The walking ones are easy enough,just keep a shotgun on your hand and you will be OK.But the big ones need a plan,a strategy and a assault of weapons. 9.5/10\n\nGraphics: From Black Mesa labs to even Alien fields of doom,this game is amazing.It now has its own HD models,so a few things look better when the models are turned \"ON\".Any computer will be able to get this game running,so why not jump in it already?And as this game was made in 1998,don't expect modern graphics.But that couldn't stop you from playing this game,could it?The terrain is kind of blocky and the characters as well,but if you look past that point get ready to indulge into a game that made gaming as it is today.And the graphics aren't that bad,everything is quite understandable.They have made the graphics the best way they could,and I don't blame them because I don't vote a game by its graphics.And if you can't stand the graphics there is a Source version of the game,made by Valve as well.There is a version made by fans as well,but I wouldn't recommend that because it is modified a bit.But the original is the best in my opinion as it is the completly unmodified version of half life,and the best out there.Of course,that is if you look past the graphics.There are even little details specified in the originl game,but they won't be seen so good and will be kind of blurred.But be sure to keep your eyes lit,for there are many levers,buttons and things like that throughout the game,that blend in with the enviroment. 8.5/10\n\nOverall look: Even though this game is dated,it is definently not dead.Be sure to pick this game up on a sale,or even buy it at its full price,because this game is worth every cent you pay for it.I loved the game,it really got me pulled in and the story was just stunning.I loved every place I came upon to in this game,seeking new adventure and traveling on into the deep unknown.This game is filled with interesting moments and is guaranteed to keep you aroused until the very ending.This is a great classic and everyone should play it,it is an experience not to be missed.It changed gaming as it is now,and was a hit in gaming and it still is.A wonderful game.

I wrote a review for it a little while after but I am not particularly happy with it, so here's the re-write of my Half-Life review.\n\n[h1] In Short - [/h1]\n\nHalf-Life currently and always will occupy the grand title of my favourite game ever. Although that title is shared with a few other games (Hotline Miami 2, Kid Icarus: Uprising, etc) the position is not very easy to get to. Although my reviews may not make it seem this way but I am extremely critical of video games, making it very hard to actually title a game my favourite. Yet there's something so painfully gripping about Half-Life. From story, to gameplay. Level design to even graphics, the game really masters the FPS genre, especially for its time.\n\n[h1] More In Depth - [/h1]\n\nIf you weren't aware - which is almost impossible - Half-Life follows the story of a scientist named Gordon Freeman. One day at work an experiment goes horribly wrong and a portal is opened to a dimension named [i]Xen[/i]. Gordon then sets out on a 'quest' to escape the now broken facility, fighting both Xen aliens and a group of HECU soldiers who come to the facility to clean up any evidence of this incident. This story is further expanded in the game's expansions, Half-Life: Blue Shift and Half-Life: Opposing Force, and expanded further still in the sequel Half-Life 2. This story is conveyed completely without cutscenes. From the first moments to the last, every single part of the game you are in control of Freeman. You can also decide to kill whoever you like. Scientists and friendly guards are 100% killable and you can decide to either spare or destroy anybody who crosses your path. While it does not directly affect anything that happens in the game, it is still very interesting to have such control over what you do. Control taken out in many recent games.\n\n[h1] Freeman's Arsenal [/h1]\n\nOne great thing about Half-Life is the range of weaponry available. Crossbow? Check! Pistol? Check! RPG? Check! SMG? Check! And it goes on and on, with even more added in the expansion Half-Life: Opposing Force. Some guns are completely made up, too, such as the Gluon Gun, a personal favourite. Along with this there are explosives such as grenades, trip mines and satchel charges. Each gun and explosive has a different use and a situation to use it in, making the play of Half-Life very easy to switch up and appeal to many different people.\n\n[h1] Level Design [/h1]\n\nHalf-Life is a decently long game all things considered. 17 chapters altogether, some chapters longer than others, however all are a decent chunk of game. As most of the game takes place inside of the facility (named Black Mesa), most parts of the game are labs and rooms you'd find in a scientific facility. Parts are exploded or broken, due to the fighting that is taking place, along with various explosions. Enemy placement is done well, and the AI is also pretty good, some obviously smarter than others, the Black Ops being the hardest to kill in my opinion. With each scene change comes new scenery, always fitting the setting. I won't expand because I'd like to stay spoiler free, but the point is that all the level design is well done, from enemy placement to textures and such.\n\n[h1] PROs and CONs [/h1]\n\nPROs - \n[list]\n\n[*] A unique, interesting, cutscene-less story line that follows you through the game\n[*] Easy to get the hang of, no weird controls or confusing catches. \n[*] Very simple to put down and pick back up, due to the above and other contributing factors.\n[*] Despite the 1998 release date, some pretty nice graphics.\n[*] A whole range of enemies to fight. \n[*] And on top of that, a giant range of weapons to kill those enemies with.\n[/list]\n\nCONs - \n[list]\n[*] Occasionally - although not commonly - repetitive. Yeah, I've crawled through vents whacking Headcrabs before.\n[*] A very linear path all the way through the game. Few ways to get lost or get side tracked. Maybe some people are happy about that? Not me.\n[*] A somewhat underwhelming boss fight. Don't get me wrong, I loved the final boss, I just think there could have been more to it.\n[*] A few confusing points where you're not particularly sure what to do. \n[*] Ammo for many guns is surprisingly scarce. Some of my favourites, for example the magnum, would have very little ammo around, and as such it would make it more likely for you to simply spray your SMG instead of trying some new tactic.\n[*] Little music. There is music occasionally, and it really does increase the intensity when it is used, but I feel that more music could've been used.\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts - [/h1]\n\nHalf-Life is an old game. There's no question there. Thus it has been reviewed, talked about and mentioned many times previously. This review is less so recommending you to buy it and more tributing one of the best games in existance. Never played Half-Life before? Buy it, the only thing you'll regret is that you hadn't played it earlier. I wholeheartedly recommend this game, without question. Anybody who does not have this game in their library is seriously missing out.\n\n[code][b] Enjoy this review?

For the people who don't know, Half-Life was the first game that Valve has ever released. The game started the success of Valve that resulted in many game classics and Steam (on which you are now reading this review). \n\nHalf-Life itself is a first person shooter. The big difference between Half-Life and other first person shooters is that instead of just shooting, it also has exploration parts through puzzles and platforming. What I really liked is that nothing in the game takes the control away from the player. You go through the entire game and choose what to do by yourself at any given moment. The game doesn't have cutscenes and the story is experienced through gameplay and dialogue. But you can also just walk past all the characters in the story and just continue. I really appreciated this, because if you die you don't have to listen to what you already know. That makes following the story optional, even though there is only a little bit of story given which is basically just: You work at a research lab and everything went wrong. Try to escape. Many parts of the story are mysteries  you just have to figure out by yourself throughout the game. I only got annoyed once due to a scientist explaining what was already shown to me through gameplay. \n\nThe first experience of playing Half-Life felt a little bit boring. The loading for areas was really annoying, and I thought the game didn't look all that well. After a while though I got into it, and I didn't stop. Thanks to this game, I have a new insane record of non-stop playing without leaving my chair for 13.2 hours, until I completed the game. I guess that also has to do with the fact that it was my first day of my vacation, and hadn't played a game for a long while.\nWhat makes the game so much fun is that you feel so free because nothing is told and you have to figure everything out by yourself through gameplay, which is really satisfying. I never really got stuck for a long while, because everything you find in a room has a reason to be there. \n\nThe shooting is also fun and gets even more fun over time. The only problem I had, which might just be a personal issue, is that I think the weapons were not very well balanced. For instance, I wish the shotgun did more damage to make it an instant-kill up close. What I also liked is that in the game there are enough exploration parts and different roads to take, which resulted in me knowing  I haven't seen everything yet.\n\nAfter I finished Half-Life I found out that Valve has updated this original version of Half-Life with better textures, sound and other stuff so that explains why it is easier to look at the old things after a while and be amazed by what Half-Life really is.  \n\nIn conclusion, I can say that I still recommend playing this updated version of the original Half-Life. What makes Half-Life special is the variety of shooting, puzzle solving and platforming and the lack of hand holding throughout the story and the entire game itself. Playing through Half-Life can make you think about whether we took more steps backwards than forwards with the games nowadays. \n\nP.S.\nI will be going through the whole Half-Life series. \nHere I will put links to my other Half-Life game reviews:\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/recommended/50/]Half-Life: Opposing Force[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/recommended/130/]Half-Life: Blue Shift[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/recommended/220/]Half-Life 2[/url]\n\nInteresting to share:\nThe add-on Half-Life: decay ( originally for the ps2 ) is now playable as a Half-Life mod. \nDownloadable here at: [url=http://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-decay/downloads/half-life-decay]moddb[/url] I played it and I have to say it is pretty descent in co-op.", "timestamp_created": 1468274820, "timestamp_updated": 1470397759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.766561448574066162", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13971990": {"recommendationid": "13971990", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969948521", "num_games_owned": 1507, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505425236}, "language": "english", "review": "You play the role of Gordon Freeman and arrive late for work at the Black Mesa research facility. As you are walking through the steel corridors to get down to the test chamber all the other scientists keep saying: \"They are waiting for you Gordon in the test chamber\". After 4 loading screens and alot of waiting on scientists to mock you for being late before letting you progress to the test chamber you at last arrive there to do some testing with crystals from the alien world Xen. \n\nHowever the test goes wrong the very second you push the Xen crystal mounted on a Lawn mower into a beam for testing. This creates the resonance cascade which creates a rift between earth and Xen, allowing Vortigaunts and other alien species to enter earth at will. The Black Mesa security cannot stop the aliens and the army is called in. The army is however not there to help the Black Mesa personnel. They are there to kill everybody invovled with the project.\n\nGordon Freeman must now fight the aliens, fight the soldiers, try to save the scientists that mocked him for being late and with the help of the scientists reach Xen to stop Nihilanth(The Alien mastermind). \n\n\nOverall Half-Life is probably one of those games ive spent the most time playing. Outside of steam that is. Bought it back in 1999 and when steam came along my key was already taken steam said(To verify my key I had to take a photo of my product and its key and send it to valve and back in 2004 that was not an easy thing to do). So I had to play it outside of steam until it ended up on one of those sales. If you have steam and don't have Half-Life then I recomend you buying it as quickly as possible.\n\nHalf-Life is also being remade by a team of dudes. The mod is called Black Mesa. Its avalible for download but it lacks the last levels that were sceduled to be released 2 years ago.\n\nI give Half-Life 10/10 for being a great game and having great replay value.", "timestamp_created": 1421170403, "timestamp_updated": 1421170403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.840288698673248291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26495645": {"recommendationid": "26495645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030092592", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474018948}, "language": "english", "review": "Damn, this is the best shooter I've ever played. \n\nI don't have any nostalgia for this and I'm not even a big fan of shooters, but this game is so well made that I can't do anything but praise it. \n\nSure it might not have aged that well visually but the atmosphere and uniqe look of the game shines through after all these years.

This is another game I mostly missed when I came out, so I'm not writing this out of nostalgia. This is simply a joy to play throughout, mixing tight shooting with some clever first-person puzzle design. Even the platforming sections are good, although in the latter part of the game where you enter an alien world, there are some \"trampoline\" spots on the floor which are supposed to launch you into the air when you step on them. However, I found them to be unreliable - sometimes they seemed to not work and required a bit of trial and error to get you in the air.\n\nHalf-Life's main claim to FPS fame is its level design - it's very tight and well-designed, showing the triple-A gaming industry of today that you don't always need an \"open world\" to be immersive. Cleverly designed linear paths can do the job if it is believable and has enough variety to keep you entertained, which Half-Life does very well. Another part of its level design that was revolutionary at the time and still holds up well today is how they are constructed - there are no long loading screens, cutscenes, or ludicrous splits between levels. It is all contiguous and seamless, meaning that throughout the game there are very few points that give you a feeling of complete \"safety\" - enemies can often reach you anywhere, and the game feels like one long sequence rather than several shoddily tied-together ones. The lack of cutscenes means the story is told through what are referred to as \"scripted sequences\" - meaning that in order to learn what is happening, it pays to pay attention to what is happening around you and listen to what NPCs are saying. This could be a conversation between survivors, or listening to a radio signal. I love good cutscenes - like the beautiful ones in Thief II for instance - but Half-Life shows a different way of doing things and makes it more than just a shooter.\n\nBut Half-Life IS a shooter - and thankfully the shooting is brilliant. The weapons all feel different and unique, and have their advantages and disadvantages. The AI holds up well especially for the time, knowing when to retreat and where and when to use projectile weapons - like grenades for instance. There is a satisfying variety of human and non-human opponents all with different modes of attack. There are only a couple of boss fights - the last of which is a bit weird. Both, however, are quite challenging and thankfully the levels they are designed in allow for either tactics or all-guns blazing, which is very risky. The game does not hold your hand with objective lists or mission markers, so don't miss anything important! Especially not switches - don't rush through areas just because they have no enemies! I did this once during a genuinely tense section where a set of tentacles guard a missile silo and had to go back again to turn the switches on. Oh, and make sure you do the training section at the beginning of the game - I missed this and therefore didn't know how to do a long jump three-quarters of the way through the game!\n\nOne area where the game does show its age is the limited character modelling, animation and voice acting, but then many modern games today are no better in this area. It does mean, however, that we had to wait until Half-Life 2 until we got a set of different characters that we built a relationship with and who had a set of distinct dialogue. But if you want shooter action with clever design, Half-Life still delivers. Oh, and the game is surprisingly gory and graphic - dismembered body parts fall out of broken air vents, blood spatters out of soldier's bodies, and tanks and planes blow up into smithereens. Definitely try this game if you're looking for a shooter that takes you on a challenging, continuous journey rather than just dumping you in lots of different places at a time and does most of the shooting for you.\n", "timestamp_created": 1496962595, "timestamp_updated": 1496962595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.733691751956939697",
