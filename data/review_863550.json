After the restart of the series in 2016, Hitman 2 continues where Hitman ended. Both games actually belong together and form a single story.\n\nWhile the major story wraps around a world-wide criminal organization and Agent 47s past, every single mission has its own narrative. As well as the overall story, all mission stories are exciting, credible and interesting.\n\nOn first glance, Hitman 2 only consists of six main missions and two training missions. If you set the game to easy and only aim to kill all targets as fast, simple and loud as possible, you could probably finish the game in a single day. But that's not the way Hitman is meant to be played. \n\nThe idea is to repeat every mission several times, to explore the areas of the rather huge maps and find many different ways to eliminate your targets as stealthy as possible. Even after playing a mission for the tenth or fifteenth time you usually still discover something new. \n\nIn order to get familiar with a mission, story challenges can be played. Story challenges are additional stories within a mission that help you learn the map and find out what's going on. Every mission is full of details and contains additional stories within the story.\n\nPlaying a mission for the very first time is extremely satisfying. Enter highly realistic playgrounds in exotic places all around the globe. Start by ignoring your objectives, listen to people talking, scout the area. It's fascinating and exciting because you're always at risk of being detected if you trespass into sealed off territory and it feels incredibly realistic. \n\nAll missions from season 1 (Hitman 2016) have been updated and are playable within Hitman 2. New modes, new ways to carry out murders, as well as a visual facelift were added. Hitman 2 automatically detects if you own missions from season 1 and adds them to Hitman 2.\n\nIn addition to the missions there's a sniper map that's highly enjoyable. As of today there's only a single sniper map but IOI announced to release more sniper maps in the future.\n\nThere are a number of DLCs from season 1. Missions that play in existing locations but with completely new objectives and stories. It's very well done and offers a lot of additional play-time. Additional DLCs for Hitman 2 have been announced.\n\nThe multiplayer Ghost mode is a 1v1 online mode that puts all of your assassination skills to the test as you compete against your opponent to eliminate targets as quickly and cleanly as possible to take the win. So far, I only tried this once and didn't stand a chance. I probably will try again later.\n\nYou can also create your own missions. IOI calls them contracts. You can setup your own contracts and play contracts from players all around the world. IOI picks the best and rates them.\n\nAbout once per month IOI adds elusive targets. Time to kill the target is limited and you only have a single chance to eliminate the target. If you fail, the mission can never be played again. No progress saving. No second chance. It's intense. Prepare to fail while your adrenaline level blows your mind. The sensation is fantastic!\n\nThe biggest achievement of Hitman 2 is the games realism. People react very realistic and it's simply fascinating to play in such a world. Sound effects and music are brilliant and voice acting is perfect. The kind of freedom Hitman creates is astonishing. There's simply no other game like it today because no other game manages to make the ai act as believable as Hitman does.\n\nEvery mission play-through is rated. The less collateral damage you cause and the stealthier you work, the higher your score. High scores are important for in-game challenges and achievements. Reaching certain in-game challenges unlocks additional equipment that you can use in new missions. \n\nThe real task of the game is not simply eliminating targets. The challenge is to lure them in the right position so you can kill them quietly or make it look like an accident. It's often very difficult to face your target eye to eye because there are many other people, security and bodyguards. The challenge is to get your targets where you want them. Killing them is just the icing on the cake. And since putting your targets in the right spot is sometimes very time-consuming and demanding, killing them feels very satisfying.\n\nHitman 2 is a masterpiece. For me it's the best game since Skyrim and I loved Skyrim.\n\nPros:\n- perfect level design\n- extremely diversified\n- perfect voice acting\n- great graphics\n- very realistic ai in all situations\n- brilliant music, reminiscent to James Bond movies\n- great sound effects\n- fantastic atmosphere\n- feels very realistic\n- perfect light effects\n- extremely high re-playability\n- dozens of ways to eliminate targets in each mission\n- several story events per mission\n- thoughtful and interesting story\n- very well worked out clever missions\n- creates very intense tension\n- highly satisfying\n- addictive\n- each mission is unique and different\n- sometimes very funny, watch the guy in the Swedish Embassy in Morocco who tries to assemble an IKEA chair\n- difficult in a positive way. Some games are frustrating if they are too difficult. This game makes you want to try again and again if you fail.\n- setting feels a lot like James Bond and very British\n- huge content, hundreds of hours play-time if you try to complete all challenges\n- developers are constantly adding new content\n- runs very smoothly, no bugs, no crashes\n- lots of equipment for Agent 47\n- sometimes relates to historic events. Pablo Escobar brought hippopotamus to Columbia for his private zoo. In Hitman 2 you can make a member of a drug cartel die by feeding him to his hippo.\n- subtile murder, kill a guy undergoing surgery by destroying his donor heart or inform his doctor that the patient killed the doctors father\n\nNeutral:\n- requires permanent online connection (I don't mind but some players might)\n- voice acting only in english (but sub-titles in various languages)\n\nCons:\n- takes about 110 GB hard drive space (silver edition, expansions not released yet)\n- limited save slots", "timestamp_created": 1550395878, "timestamp_updated": 1550411087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.796221792697906494", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49009986": {"recommendationid": "49009986", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982793768", "num_games_owned": 11029, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 5256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 389, "last_played": 1550971790}, "language": "english", "review": "Hitman 2 is a reminder of why we play video games.

(prologue) An example of the clever marketing that squeezes every little thing to make it seem more than it actually is.\n\n- No sign of promised DLC levels, latest announcement indicates only one of the two already paid for levels for gold users coming out in 2019, no roadmap either.\n\n- On the plus side IOI have presented a masterclass in marketing, spending most of their resources on very high end videos and announcements that give the illusion of new updates & content being more than they actually are. Clever word-play, posh looking video productions/cinematics, artwork and aesthetics hide the fact that the updates bring very little new additions, a temporary target, a cosmetically different weapon that\u2019s already in the game etc\n\nIt now makes sense why the game requires an internet connection to play to get any progress & unlocks.

The levels in my opinion are structured a bit better and can be a bit more confusing to trench thru, but that also is a good thing. It makes you pay a little more attention to mapping out that special way of killing your target, makes you pay attention to that conversation between 2 npc's to later find out there's another access point to a specific area that you have been blindly passing by unnoticed.

I was 6 and had no clue what im doing but was still having a blast. I still own first 4 hitman games original cds on playstation 2 (codename 47 on pc). I played every Hitman game to this date and i gotta say I am having a blast with this one. Levels were never this big and beautiful, they never felt this alive. Crowded cities like Miami and Mumbai, dark Colombian rainforests, quite Vermont neighbourhood, every location looks original and very much alive with npcs talking about all kinds of stuff, from football matches to what they had for dinner last night. Every map is really interesting and fun to explore.\n\nNow the real stuff, the targets. Every target has a short bio that you might or might not care about, they all act differently through the level and you can learn a lot more about them by being close to them and listening to what they have to say. The story is pretty meh and confusing but you probably wont be buying this game for the story. \n\nThere are numerous ways to kill your targets, from a simple neck snap or a bullet to the head to killing them in very unique ways like killing them with a train, pushing them inside iron maidens, poisoning them, drowning them, throwing them to the goddamn hippo... the list could go on and on and on. \n\nIf you are a type of person that just wants to run through the game you might want to skip this one as each mission can be completed in 30-40 minutes. The real value is the replayability this game offers. I completed every mission 7-8 times and still dont feel bored and there are still tons of things I gotta do. There is a level up system which gives you new weapons and items as rewards. Other game modes include a pvp mode where you compete with other player in killing your target in the most silent and original way possible, sniper mode which can be played solo or with another player, contracts mode which lets you create and play other people's contracts which offers unlimited replayability.

I knew it was simply going to be more levels and some additional features under the guise of a new game but I didn't care. Now that I have the game I'm shocked at the bare bones 'new' content and how it was implemented. \n\nNo saves or unlocks were carried over from HITMAN 2016 to HITMAN 2 which, although annoying, gave me reason to replay the older levels. This wouldn't have been an issue if it wasn't for the number of game breaking bugs and annoyances. It was frustrating to the point of rage quit when element that worked (and indeed still work )in HITMAN 2016 failed in bizarre manners in the sequel.\n\nThis would have been okay if the new content made up for it but it sadly misses the mark. The new levels are massive to the point of being annoying to replay. This inconvenience is exacerbated when forced to grind challenges to unlock items and basic unlocks that I started with in HITMAN 2016 and/or expected to be already in my arsenal.\n\nThe final straw was when the latest elusive target, which is a great feature of the game, was not only set on a level that I have been playing since 2016 but was an exact copy of a target I had already completed. This was made worse when after the target spotted me the game bugged out, alerting all guards to my presence, thus allowing me to get gunned down. '\n\nI'm annoyed at repeated content because it is broken, I'm annoyed at the limited gameplay styles, especially considering they didn't bother to port all content from HITMAN 2016 and I'm extremely annoyed at the laziness. \n\nIf you loved HITMAN 2016 and played a large amount of content avoid this lazy expansion pack sequel.

The cover for the lackluster story and missions is that the levels are ment to be a sandbox for the player to decide how they wish to proceed with a mission. Although I have enjoyed replaying the missions, the campaign and its story are extremely lacking for a $84 AUD game (base price without dlcs or special editions). It is like having a bowl of ice cream without any toppings and its just one scoop. Its good but it really is missing a large amount of content that can be only supplemented though spending more money on dlcs and upgrades. \nThe game hints you into buying additional campaign missions from the previous episodic hitman release a few years ago and the special edition pre-order mission offered for that game as patient zero. It has a lot to be desired. \n\nIf you're interested in playing this game, get it while its on special but be warned that you'll go right though the campaign quick so you'll probs want all the content in a special edition in about a year.

Sorry but what is this sh!tshow?\nThe enemies knowing everthing, they are seeing everything (from a huge distance and through walls) and they are hearing everything (subduing an enemy and an other enforcers hears this from a distance off 200 yards). It gets very frustrating to get the Silent Assassin, Suit Only challange on Master because it makes 0 sense! Everytime when you are doing your illegal stuff an enemy pops out off nowhere and spots you, it seems that the game is teleporting the enforcer instantly to your location. Raging in FiFA and CoD is nothing compared to this game.\nThe game has many bugs, the most annoying one is that your save game gets corrupted when you are loading a savegame. It bricks your Silent Assassin rating and you are not achieving the challange even though you did a perfect run. The problem is that the game takes your mistake (getting spotted) over to your savegame which you are loading.\nAnother very annoying point is, when you try to subdue an enemy from behind you start a fist fight unintentionally which is also game breaking. How in the hell can they put these both actions on one button? This game is sooooo stupid! You need to get extreme close to the enemy to subdue him, they shortened the distance to perform this action compared to the older Hitman games. The problem is when you touch the enemy he will detect you. In other words the controls are very clunky and inaccurate.\nThere is 0 communication between the ignorant developers and the community. They are ignoring everthing from suggestions to bug reports.\nPerformance is also very poor. Most of the time the game runs with 40-50 FPS at 1440P on a 1080TI and R7 1700\nI'm honest, this game is way to overrated.

I understand the troubles IOI Interactive have had dealing with switching publishers, but the release of Hitman 2 is an utter shame. I fanboys will say to give them a pass because they were short on money, and if Hitman 2 didn't sell well, then they'd have to close the studios. There are some great things about Hitman 2, but the down right laziness from the developers is astonishing. \n\nI understand they don't have the money, or the fancy publisher to get the nice visual cut scenes, I can live without them, but they advertised \"new\" guns, when all they did was slap a \"2\" on the gun an call it \"new\", when its the same model from the previous game. Sure, you could over look that, and look how the game plays overall, it plays decently, when it works, but they constantly update the game and frequent crashes are the norm, just get the discussion pages. \n\nHitman 2 was nothing but a cash grab for IOI interactive, so they can open another studio to make more games, instead of focusing in on the current one they made. If you enjoyed the previous installment, then you will enjoy this one as well, but I would not recommend buying this game at full price, there just isn't enough content to deem that reasonable. \n\nIf you're new to the Hitman franchise and want to get into the game, wait for a sale, or find it cheaper else where, if you aren't planning to get mastery level 20 on each map, then there isn't much to do. For me, this personally wasn't an issue, but a lot of players of the game are unhappy that all there progress in the previous game did not carry over to the sequel. I'm not sure why they couldn't carry the progress over, but the fanboys will give a lot of excuses for this developer. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1550355573, "timestamp_updated": 1550355573, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437201917171478271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48833602": {"recommendationid": "48833602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880660470", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549946913}, "language": "english", "review": "Its Fun when it works.

Whatever side of the fence you sit on: HITMAN 2 may very well be the last good classic AAA stealth series that hasn't gone the way of Deus Ex, Thief and Metal Gear Solid... and that's worth bearing in mind.\n\nBefore I delve into pros and cons, and whether you should buy this game, I'd first like to talk about what's different in HITMAN 2 when compared to the previous game HITMAN 2016 (which I'll refer to as HITMAN from now on). To start with we've got 2 new mechanics - pockets of vegetation/grass on maps hide us if we're crouched and you can now escape a NPC's line of sight by walking amongst a small group of people (this system is practically identical to the one used in Hitman: Absolution). There's also a less noticeable gameplay mechanic that's been introduced: NPCs can now see you in mirrors and other reflective surfaces (this change for realism doesn't make things incredibly hard but it will keep you on your toes as bathrooms used to mean a guaranteed unnoticed kill).\n\nNext we have 3 difficulty settings - Casual, Professional and Master. Casual is a completely new difficulty setting aimed at people unfamiliar with the series and those of us who wish to muck around without having to worry about cameras or dying right away (thanks to the huge increase in damage Agent 47 can take in this difficulty mode). Professional is essentially HITMAN's Normal difficulty mode renamed, and with an extra change - cameras that spot you with a weapon or illegally trespassing will alert nearby guards. Master difficulty is HITMAN's Professional difficulty mode but slightly easier in terms of challenge - there's more enforces, and you still only have 1 save per mission, but most items that are visibly held are no longer suspicious.\n\nIn addition to this, all difficulties are available from the start and can be effortlessly selected without having to exit out and access another menu. Lastly 2 new gameplay modes have been added outside of the main campaign: Ghost Mode (a race against the clock killing targets with a silhouette of another online player who you are competing with) AND Sniper Assassin (a mode very similar to Hitman: Absolution's \"Sniper Challenge\" which has you sniping targets from afar and aiming to rack up a nice score - this can be played solo or with another person online).\n\nAs you can see quite a bit has changed since HITMAN, for the better I believe. So let's get onto pros and cons!\n\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[b]1.[/b] The game is no longer episodic\n[b]2.[/b] 6 new maps that are of much more consistent quality than those that were offered in HITMAN and the NPCs on these maps have serviceable accents\n[b]3.[/b] New gameplay mechanics as well as new ways to play HITMAN 2 outside of the campaign\n[b]4.[/b] More unique and creative ways of killing targets\n[b]5.[/b] A better story that answers a lot of questions HITMAN raised and even explores some of Agent 47's past\n[b]6.[/b] A lot of additional free content in the works and continual live-content updates\n[b]7.[/b] The game looks breathtaking at times (try out the Whittleton Creek map and you'll see nice shades of red and yellow that just make your jaw drop)\n[b]8.[/b] The briefcase has returned - praise be!!! Sniper Rifles have been made an illegal weapon in this game, regardless of disguise, so the briefcase is now your best friend. Conceal that bad boy, go to a location, retrieve it (complete with an unpacking animation for some rifles) and deliver some Hitman justice 47-style. You can also use the briefcase to smuggle in other gear and even use it as a melee object at close and long-range. Have a rest fans of the Hitman subreddit: you did good, you did good.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1570177950\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n[b]1.[/b] Denuvo DRM - there is lots of debate on why it's needed and just how much impact it has on a PC but when HITMAN removed DRM years later, the effect on performance and stability was negligible at best.\n[b]2.[/b]  Quite a few reskins of HITMAN's items - I understand why this was done but it's a bit disappointing\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[b]1.[/b] 6 maps (the first is arguably more of a semi-tutorial and thus this is a smaller offering than what HITMAN gave us campaign-wise)\n[b]2.[/b] Always-online (already unlocked content can be used offline, but in order to unlock new gear you will need to be connected to the Hitman servers)\n[b]3.[/b] Performance is slightly worse when compared to HITMAN and many echo this on the forums - it's especially worse on some of the HITMAN maps that were remastered and included in HITMAN 2 as the \"legacy pack\"\n[b]4.[/b] Stability - I've only had 10 crashes in my 180+ hours of gametime but a lot of other users have encountered frequent crashing\n[b]5.[/b] More questionable decisions from IOI regarding time-limited content like Elusive Targets and a Christmas reskin of a map that was available permanently for HITMAN will now be time-limited for HITMAN 2 - this makes no sense!\n[b]6.[/b] Gold edition for HITMAN 2 has an unreasonable price tag IMHO\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1595641125\n\n\nTo conclude HITMAN 2 is what HITMAN should've been thanks to its fun levels, extra polish and for the most part: listening to its fans. I do think HITMAN 2 and the series as a whole is often underlooked, and perhaps there's some valid reasons as to why that is the case, but I think the game and IOI is worth supporting simply because it's the last of its kind in an industry where Fallout 76 and Star Wars Battlefront II is all too often the norm. It's a breath of fresh air quite frankly and the game has amazing replay value if you dig semi-linear sandbox maps and the groundhog day gameplay where you're always revisiting a level and looking for another way to approach it and pull off that perfect kill.\n\nWith some more patches I believe HITMAN 2 can be a 9/10 game. A game you never put down. But right now I'll give it a 8/10... and if you're a big fan of the series you should definitely consider grabbing it ASAP.\n\n\n[h1]P.S.

No humans would be reading your information anyway, it's all encrypted to be used in an algorythm.\nThe information they got from your gameplay sessions will not be shared and only used as feedback for their games. \n\nThis fearmongering of two certain avoidable parts of the Privacy Policy is ridiculous.\nDid you know that the person behind the 2K+ upvoted negative review who complained about the Privacy Policy is also the same guy who spent almost two thousand hours of GTA Online? Check out Rockstar's Privacy Policy, more specifically the \"WHAT PERSONAL AND OTHER INFORMATION DOES THE COMPANY COLLECT\": https://www.rockstargames.com/privacy\n\nIt looks like they collect way more personal data than what IOI does.\nSo are the people who review bombed this game are hypocrites or have double standards?\nWho knows? You'll be the one to judge.\n\nAnyway, I get that it's unfair that people aren't able to unlock anything in offline mode (which is a stupid decision by IOI) because they're disagreed to the Privacy Policy but I think it's unfair that a good AAA game like HITMAN 2 is being criticised for collecting personal data that can be avoided, even if you agreed to the policy, while there's other games or websites like social media that does that sort of thing much worse.\n\nIn conclusion, people misunderstood the part of the Privacy Policy where IOI collects personal data which can be avoided even if you agreed to the policy by simply not doing two things: Making an IOI account and accessing their websites.\nWhen you're connected to their servers, they only collect game information that are basically your statistics and performances.\nI think the game is great and definitely has improved from the previous game but it still have some flaws like forcing you to connect to their servers in order to unlock new goodies but assuming that you do have reading comprehension skills for IOI's Privacy Policy that was designed to not contain strange legal language so people like you can read it easily, you should have no problem accepting their policy so you can connect to their servers and you can prevent them from collecting your personal info as you wish.\n\nIf you made it all the way to the end of this wall of text, thank you so much for actually reading it and have a nice day.", "timestamp_created": 1542781566, "timestamp_updated": 1545314413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1532, "votes_funny": 56, "weighted_vote_score": "0.894995748996734619", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "46485342": {"recommendationid": "46485342", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992694498", "num_games_owned": 1987, "num_reviews": 160, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 59, "last_played": 1550868372}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Season 2[/h1]\n\nHitman 2016 to me personally is a masterpiece.

It was the best Hitman game for me hands down, no competition.\n\nHitman 2 is basically the same game. It\u2019s just a second season. Gameplay is practically the same. There are couple of new mechanics, but it\u2019s the same Hitman game as it was before only with new locations. There\u2019s a saying \u201cdon\u2019t fix it if it\u2019s not broken\u201d. I kind of agree with that but there\u2019s a but.\n\nNo matter how good the game is, even if it\u2019s perfect, there\u2019s always a way to improve it and Hitman isn\u2019t improved, you can even say it\u2019s a little bit downgraded and full game costs 90\u20ac. For that price I expected an improvement.\nWhat to improve? I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not a developer of AAA game with budget of millions. With that money and Warner brothers help I believe developers could\u2019ve done a better job.\n\nSo gameplay is the same. You get to a huge location, you won\u2019t explore it all in one playthrough, this game has a huge replayability value. Please don\u2019t even think buying it if your goal is to complete the game. If that\u2019s your case then the game isn\u2019t for you. You\u2019re meant to replay levels and eliminate your targets using different methods.\n\nYou can allow the game hold your hand and tell you what to do or you can play without any help. This is good for people who are new to Hitman or just don\u2019t want to run around for hours figuring something out. Even following the in-game guide it\u2019s really fun. So this game is accessible for anyone. Don't be afraid to buy if you're slow and a bad gamer in general.\n\nIt\u2019s not a shooter like Absolution, the best way is silent and stealthy way and it\u2019s the most fun way. If you expect shoot everybody this game is not for you. The whole point of the game is to be a silent assassin. You can achieve this by killing only targets, learning the layout of the map and choosing your equipment.\n\nNew improvements are very minor. You can now carry a suitcase and conceal something inside of it. Agent 47 also is not so silent anymore. Enemies can hear your steps. And mirrors. Enemies can see you in the mirror.\n\nLevel design is top notch, it\u2019s perfect. You may not like all the levels but you\u2019ll love at least some of them just like in previous game. Different levels pleases everyone because everyone will find a level he falls in love with.\n\nGraphics are great overall, although some things could look better. Crowded levels are just amazing. The attention to detail is outstanding. With so many people on the screen you feel like you\u2019re really in the crowd because most people look different. In other games it tends to be just few AI models copy pasted around, but in Hitman 2 the crown is really diverse.\nEnvironments are great looking too.\nBut character models could\u2019ve been updated a bit. They look the same as in previous game so I expected them to look better in a newer game.\n\nPerformance is great. I\u2019m playing on mostly max settings and getting 60fps. Have nothing bad to say here.\n\nI said the game is more expensive and feels downgraded and just doesn\u2019t feel like a 90\u20ac AAA game. What I\u2019ve noticed is that some animations looks like people are sliding instead of walking. Sorry but things like that should be done perfectly in a game of this caliber. Another thing is not important for gameplay but it was the biggest letdown. Cut-scenes are still images. Like what the fuck? I think this is not acceptable. It\u2019s not an RPG, there are only few cut-scenes and you can\u2019t make them properly? No no no, this is simply laziness, you have no excuse for this.\n\nI haven\u2019t played multiplayer because I don\u2019t care about it so can\u2019t say anything about it.\n\nOne more thing. As for a triple A title I think the sales aren\u2019t very good seeing that the game reached only ~10k online at the same time in the first week of release. I think this will be a good lesson for developers to stop being lazy and increasing the price of the game while adding nothing new. I love the game and I\u2019m happy I bought it but I hate when developers become too confident of themselves and stop innovating.\n\nNevertheless this is a must buy for people who loved Hitman 2016, you\u2019ll love it. And everyone else who love good stealth games, being able to do things how they like and like sandbox gameplay should buy it.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Huge open levels can be played many time and feel completely different\n[*]Great looking game with lots of details\n[*]Countless ways to eliminate the targets\n[*]Fun for casuals and hardcore players\n[/list]\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Still cut-scenes\n[*]Character models could look better\n[*]some animation issues\n[/list]\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32930811-Kosmos%27s-Cosmic-reviews/?appid=704030][h1]My curator page[/h1][/url]", "timestamp_created": 1542932987, "timestamp_updated": 1542933009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 252, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.881906390190124512", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48656075": {"recommendationid": "48656075", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042840701", "num_games_owned": 755, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1544409272}, "language": "english", "review": "+1 for removing denuvo.", "timestamp_created": 1548892235, "timestamp_updated": 1548892235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 121, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.853095173835754395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45818612": {"recommendationid": "45818612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024554172", "num_games_owned": 784, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546193084}, "language": "english", "review": "I nominated this for The \"Best Environments\" Award during the 2018 Steam Awards\n\nI can already tell this game is a HUGE improvement on HITMAN (2016).

HITMAN 2 is worth the full price and it's my PC Game of The Year 2018.[/h1]\n[b]If you liked HITMAN (2016) then you'll enjoy this one as well.[/b]\n\nHITMAN 2 isn't a great sequel but it isn't bad either. It's more of the same and I'm fine with it.\nIt does add a couple of things though. HITMAN 2 reintroduces the briefcase, which allows the player to conceal large weapons, such as sniper rifles. There is a cooperative Sniper Assassin mode. The mode has only one map where two players sit on a cliff and snipe people. That's it.\nThere is also a one-vs.-one Ghost Mode. In this mode players start a match side-by-side. They can\u2019t attack or interact with each other. You are unaffected by the actions of your opponent. Eliminate targets quickly and cleanly to win.\n\nAll six locations from the previous HITMAN are in HITMAN 2 as part of the Hitman Legacy Pack DLC. Players who own HITMAN (2016) will be able to download the updated maps in HITMAN 2 for free.\nHITMAN 2 has six new locations: Hawke's Bay, New Zealand; Miami, USA; Santa Fortuna, Colombia; Mumbai, India; Whittleton Creek, USA; Isle of Sg\u00e0il, North Atlantic and a Sniper Assassin map Himmelstein, Austria.\nThe maps are HUGE and you can get just as creative as in the previous title.\n\nThere are couple of things that disappoint me though. We still can't use people as human shields. HITMAN (2016) had beautiful cutscenes so I was quite sad when I discovered that HITMAN 2 doesn't have cinematic cutscenes. What we now have is a slideshow with voiceover. Characters talk over still images. It delivers the story but it isn't as engaging as in the previous title.\nThe leaderboards seem to cater towards speedrunners. I understand that time should be a factor but I think that suit only runs and such should reward more points than just being fast in a game like Hitman.\nLast but not least, no graphical improvements. I don't usually care for graphics that much but I expected some kind of an improvement.\n\nIt feels more like an update than a review but that's what HITMAN 2 is. It's just more of the same. I'm just letting you know what's new and what's a bit disappointing. It's basically like talking about a big patch or an expansion pack.\nI love the game but at the end of the day it's just HITMAN (2016) with new maps and a couple of added features and downgraded cutscenes.", "timestamp_created": 1543511490, "timestamp_updated": 1543584546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 115, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.842213809490203857", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48420319": {"recommendationid": "48420319", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972622013", "num_games_owned": 1092, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 5145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1551201244}, "language": "english", "review": "I have had conflicting emotions about Hitman 2 over the past few months of playing it. Initial experience was not great:\n\nYour progress from Hitman 2016 did not carry over, so everything you'd unlocked in terms of equipment and outfits would need to be replayed and unlocked AGAIN. Even the Sniper Assassin bonus game that came as a preorder is reset, AND with worse feeling aiming. And you can't play the preorder version anymore, it's no longer available. Essentially the 12 hours I put into that game are now down the drain with nothing to show for it.\n\nThe UI changes are garish and unintuitive, the colour choices for the minimap make it less readable and occasionally obsures vital information. The smaller development budget results in still images for the story cutscenes, making the story bits a little less engaging to follow, with no room for visual flair or engagingly directed dialogue scenes like when The Constant confronts Diana at the end of Season 1.\n\nAnd The Constant's voice actor is all of a sudden doing a completely different accent for their character, a baffling change that switched them from a creepy, intelligent semi-antagonist, into a parody bond villain with a lisp, but without the humor.\n\nThe new menu music is not nearly as fantastic as the theme for 2016.\n\nThere's no katana to unlock.\n\nThere's bugs everywhere and the levels run much worse.\n\n\"What the hell did they do the Sapienza's lighting? It was such a nice, pleasant, warm and sunny paradise summer town that made for an incredibly atmospheric and memorable location. Now it's all grey and overcast and drab!\"\n\nI put off playing the game for a few weeks because of all these things. This isn't working. The disappointment was so strong. The first level, Hawke's Bay, while fun for an initial playthrough, felt incredibly small to be considered one of the SIX advertised big locations.\n\nBut.\n\n\nEventually you get over that hump and start playing the new levels properly, and god damnit they are all really freaking good. Wonderful variety and atmosphere, tons of detail and little stories to unfold, so much wonderful freedom to plan and execute and discover. It was a genuine revelation, just like with 2016, as you start to grasp the actual depth of the levels and how much there is to do and how well everything is designed.\n\nHitman continues to offer a brand of stealth that no other game does. The concept of hiding in plain sight is continually engaging. It's really funny, it's atmospheric, it's challenging and fun and incredibly satisfying. It offers scripted, narrative paths to follow, it offers freedom of planning and improvisation, hundreds of easter eggs and hidden details. It's constantly surprising and delighting you.\n\nThe level design is easily top of the series, there is not a single \"bad\" level you don't want to play again and again (unlike Colorado in 2016 for instance). I am 75 hours into the game, having done 20/20 mastery and SA/SO in every level in the Season 1, Patient Zero and Season 2 campaigns, and I could see myself continuing to do all the little mission stories and passing 100 hours.\n\nThe Season 2 story was initially disappointing, but I have since warmed up to it a little better, and do really want to see what happens next and where they take the series.\n\nI guess my only gripes are that the Legacy levels are NOT the definitive versions of these levels.

It represents the seventh entry in the Hitman game series, and has been developed by the company IO Interactive and published by the company Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment.\n\n[i] Pro & contra: [/i]\n\n++ Art of murder. Excellent level and mission design provide a broad range of assassination options for the various targets. Some \u2018accidents\u2019 allow the player to enjoy the dark humour of the situation.\n+ Practice makes perfect. Replaying the same levels for alternate objectives and challenges. Observing patterns of movement is the key to success. Additional modes in form of elusive target, sniper assassination, and pvp ghost enrich the sandbox portfolio.   \n\no While the plot is not as engaging as in Hitman Absolution (2012), I actually found myself interested in what is going on. Furthermore, it is a direct sequel to Hitman (2016), and it improves on the story telling.\no The model of an episodic distribution of the game content over several months, as introduced in Hitman (2016), has been removed.\n\n-- Our benevolent overlord, the superb DRM. I am overjoyed to see that the developer and publisher have decided to shackle the gaming community to those \u2018secure\u2019 servers once more, based on the concept of the incorporated 3rd-party DRM called Denuvo Anti-Tamper. Let us rejoice! \n- Extensive weapon modifications like in Hitman: Blood Money (2006) are not possible. I really miss my customized Silverballers! \n\n[I] Summary: [/i]\n\nOverall, I enjoy the game in terms of sandbox and varied gameplay. It represents yet another well-executed expansion of the Hitman franchise. Nevertheless, the gaming experience is overshadowed by the implemented DRM. \n\nRecommended for fans of bar codes and sandbox enthusiasts.\n\n[i] Achievements: [/i]\n\nThis game contains the achievements from season one and two. \n\nEstimated time for 100% completion: +150 hours\n\nOffline achievements: none \nOnline achievements: 118", "timestamp_created": 1542132946, "timestamp_updated": 1550580158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 241, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.833706200122833252", "comment_count": 25, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45803231": {"recommendationid": "45803231", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019585553", "num_games_owned": 470, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 5171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1543444878}, "language": "english", "review": "Is it HITMAN 2016? No, but there's few difference mechanics-wise. \n\"If it is not broken, do not try to fix it.\"\n\nThough the new content, challenges and replayability of the old levels too, makes up for the price point. It's better optimized, gives more tools and challenges and overall a really interesting and inspiring game.\n\nThe story is going even deeper as well! Though I know not many of those playing Hitman are focused on the story, but rather the gameplay, but the story is definitely icing on the cake for this one. Story is not as clich\u00e9 as in Absolution but the gameplay of HITMAN 2016 and HITMAN 2 are superior to it in every way. Square Enix makes good RPGs but not HITMAN games.\n\nDownsides? New coin mechanics makes it somewhat challenging to distract people as opposed to the previous game and the fire extinguishers can no longer kill people when they explode, only knock them out. You now only get one breaching charge instead of two as well.\n\nAlso: Still no Dual-Wielding Silver-Ballers even though you can now unlock 2 of them. \nCome on, sweethearts at IO, give back the Dual-Wield Silver-Ballers! <3", "timestamp_created": 1542156438, "timestamp_updated": 1542309070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.812824904918670654", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45806858": {"recommendationid": "45806858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067164562", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1542182210}, "language": "english", "review": "Giving out a free demo is cool.

During each level you\u2019ll have to stay undetected and quite often switch your uniform, disguising as event staff members, or even target\u2019s personal bodyguards. Second game in a rebooted line serves as straight up story continuation and brings up some more interesting mechanics. For those of you who are uncommon with the game, developers made short introduction video and an ability to play all the levels from previous game (for the extra price, of course).\n\n[h1]Few words about the story and game universe:[/h1]\nIn any HITMAN game you can divide the story on global and local one. Global story serves as glue between the levels, explaining why your character would hunt exactly this person. In HITMAN, global story displays some top notch secret society, which is at war with unknown mercenary. Your character is hired to hunt this mercenary down. \n\nLocal story usually consists of briefing and personal data on your targets, quite often with their type of personality and some dirt on their life, be it accidental murder, or cocaine trafficking. Local briefing however, is usually quite interesting to study and track down, as it\u2019s full of various tiny interesting details, which help you to discover some more small stories. Each map not only possess own unique local story, but also slightly interconnects it with previous levels. As such, you can hear NPCs discussing how \u201csomeone\u201d murdered a guy, or TV news which tell that FBI finally found a body of dead terrorist who you had killed few maps ago.\n\n[h1]Gameplay analysis:[/h1]\nHITMAN 2 is a stealth game with an advanced rank system and multiple ways of completing the mission. And by multiple I mean really many ways:\n\nFirst way the most boring one, which is simply bringing assault weapon and turning level to the hell on Earth. In this way, security would try to stop you, using all the weaponry they have, which includes pistols, shotguns, SMGs, assault rifles and even grenades. Except that, you\u2019ll hear guards talking on the radio and commenting your actions. For example what uniform you wear, or whether you\u2019re an accurate shooter. As soon as you begin the shooting, alarm starts off and the security will try to evacuate targets to some well defended place. Game itself doesn\u2019t appreciate such approach, though, but if you\u2019re bored, feel free to give it a try.\n\nSecond way is suitable for those people who enjoys classic stealth games, as you can also bring sniper rifle, silenced pistol, or a bomb, taking down your target in a stylish way, similar to all those bad guys in the movies. Each map features at least one suitable position per target and, quite often, a spot where you can make an ambush with the bomb. If anything goes wrong, you can always use your silenced pistol and try to silence the witness, before they manage to report your illegal actions to the security. However, using lethal weaponry isn\u2019t always needed, as for minor offenses security would just try to guide you out of the restricted area.\n\nHowever, real art of the game is to make a kill on a top notch level, framing everything up in the way so that common people would believe that target\u2019s death was nothing more but an accident. This is how you get the highest score, this is how you find out more local stories on the map and this is usually the most difficult, yet somewhat enjoying way of taking out a target. Quite often such ways include dark humor, or even cynicism.\n\nComparing to previous game, the new part brought up some more new features. These are the grenades, which can be used by both, your character and the enemy. Also, old suitcase was brought back to living, so using sniper rifle has become way easier than before. From now on you can hide inside crowd (before that, enemies could see you from some distance, even if you stood behind multiple people). Overall, game feels more alive, as on many maps you\u2019ll need to interact with surroundings, such as purchasing soda, taking a ticket from people, or giving someone keys.\n\nThis is where bonuses for hitman end and more difficulties arrive: For example, if an NPC saw you snitching around for too long in one suit, and then they see you again but this time wearing some staff uniform, it\u2019s a straight mission failure, as you\u2019ll be reported. Of course, you could always shoot all the witnesses before they reach the security, or change uniform again, so that security seeks for a wrong guy instead of you, but quite often such actions have a negative impact on the final score. The last but not least is mirrors and cameras: If you try to knock out an NPC from behind but someone sees you through the mirror, you\u2019re in troubles.\n\nPerhaps, gameplay section can be finished with a short description of multiple gamemodes: One of such is a ghost mode, where you and rival hitman play on the same map and compete in time. The one who kills the 5 target, wins. Another game mode is elusive target, which came straight from previous Hitman game. In it, you are supposed to hunt down certain NPC, but duo to interesting pathfinding, quite often it brings quite some extra complications.\nOverall, gameplay-wise, HITMAN 2 feels way friendlier to the new players, as it introduces better difficulty system, which can be tweaked in even more advanced ways and has all the levels, including in-game videos with story, from HITMAN 1.\n\n[h1]The graphics:[/h1]\nUnfortunately steam has character limit on reviews, so I\u2019ll try to be short:\nGraphics feels on the same level as HITMAN 1 really. Yeah, it\u2019s a bit better than couple of years ago, but don\u2019t expect a revolution. For an AAA title it\u2019s neither good, nor bad. Just accept it how it is. Most of the impressions come not from HD looking models, but rather from the nice views, which every level is full of.\n\nThe REAL problem with the graphical aspect, however, is videos. Apparently IO interactive didn\u2019t have enough funds to repeat video quality of HITMAN 1, so what they did was making comic strip looking videos. You can literally feel how difficult it was for them to accept such a sacrifice, as most of the camera angles are placed so that you only see person sitting, or staying straight. Unfortunately, such decision also leaves a negative impact on the story, as what looked stylish in HITMAN 1, feels quite cheapish in HITMAN 2.\n\n[h1]The sound:[/h1]\nThe sound is done on a same level as before. Music feels stylish and good. So do the sounds. The only slight issue worth mentioning is the fact that for some reason game lacks subtitles for some secondary unimportant dialogues. Taking in attention the fact that game takes place in a crowded area with a lot of noise, some verbal phrases can be misheard, or even not heard at all. That only partially touches the SOUND, of course, but still\u2026\n\n[h1]Final verdict:[/h1]\nHITMAN 2 is definitely a game worth buying, or at least trying. It doesn\u2019t have too much difference from HITMAN 1 of course, however those few steps that game had made, are quite important in the series and are clearly having an impact on the gameplay. Sure, it\u2019s not perfect, for example videos in between missions look really out of place, especially after HITMAN 1 quality, and the amount of levels is quite low. \n\nYet on the bright side of things, you\u2019ll have more advanced interaction with surroundings, where cars would explode, enemies throw grenades and civilians behave similarly to real people. Besides, IO Interactive promised few DLCs which should increase amount of content and that\u2019s not even mentioning the fact that you can play whole HITMAN 1 story and that each map has high replayability value.\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/23741321/]Follow our curator page, [b]Alexander's Club Curations[/b] if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.[/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1542132666, "timestamp_updated": 1542825954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 102, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.801663875579833984", "comment_count": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45901910": {"recommendationid": "45901910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108111017", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 13481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1105, "last_played": 1551827357}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright so off the bat I'm going to clarify I'm a HITMAN superfan I played all Hitman games from codename 47 to this one and never missed one, I bought Hitman Blood Money and up on release day and pre ordered Absloution and 2016 (I didn't buy them on PC they were all on my Xbox and Xbox 360 this is the first Hitman that I pre order on PC).\n\nRighto, So I love this game it takes all the best parts from all Hitman games unlike 2016 and Absloution this game has the right old Hitman feel to it.\n\nThe gameplay is like every other Hitman game get in kill the targets however you like in a huge sandbox and rewards you with whatever way you choose to kill the targets (Unlike 2016 where it only awarded stealth players which is fine since I'm one but not so fine for other players).\n\nThe maps are great although I haven't fully explored them as I'm enjoying the Hitman 2016 levels with the new mechanics a lot, But not to worry I will return to them once I finish doing everything once again in the Legacy.\n\nAlso one thing thats annoying me is the white map I really wish we could change it to the gray 2016 map.\n\nAlright it's time I preach to IOI about getting some of the memorable missions from the past games in this game as a flashback or as a DLC (Some of those would be The Hayamoto missions or Beldingford Mannor or Murder at the Bazaar or The Lee Hong Assassination and many many more).\n\nI remember back in the day I used to comeback home from School to play Hitman 2 or contracts or Blood Money and spend the whole day trying to get Silent assassin in another way, Ah good old days.\n\nFinally I want to thank IOI for a delivering a great game and I'll be waiting for new locations and new missions.\n\n2018's game of the year on PC easily", "timestamp_created": 1542650591, "timestamp_updated": 1542898065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.774818360805511475", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45799041": {"recommendationid": "45799041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053682721", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 2947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 40, "last_played": 1551614945}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Short answer:[/b] It's awesome!\n\nI wanted more maps to the Hitman 2016 and I get what I exactly wanted.

This HITMAN 'Season 2' doesn't bring much of anything completely new to the table but rather gives MORE of what the first season already have introduced  (i.e. big level maps, high replay value, multiple ways to play) with some minor improvments i.e. crowd blending, slightly better graphics, more intuitive GUI, improved AI, etc, and a set of new maps as the main content.  Therefore, with IOI played it safe continuing strictly on the same formula this time, so it is safe to say if you like HITMAN 2016 you will like HITMAN 2.\n\nWhat's dissapointing, however, is the fact that there's still no in-depth weapon customisation and upgrade purchases and the notoriety system. Now, it's already an awesome game but as a longtime fan, something is missing. Modern Hitman games are still about Blood and not Money. Where did all those cool things seen in Hitman: Blood Money (2006) go? Those features could've brought so much to the game world. I appriciate the comeback of sniper briefcase but our 'professional' assassin guy needs to spend his hard-earned money on something SOMETHING by his own choice and not just by unlocking them like a mobile game model. It's a 'profession. it's supposed to pay and he has his rights to go shopping, And right now the game has 0 real post mission consequences no matter what approach you take to complete objectives each level. complete steath or mass massacre, leave evidence or no evidence, the consequences are minimalised and untold.

You can be sneaky, you can be unseen, or you can make perfect show and make everyone see what you did, and the best way is that you can also make it look like an accident. \n\nHITMAN 2 is a successor to 2016\u2019s HITMAN series restart and I think the game enhanced in some areas but not much overall. Maps are bigger, graphics seems to be a little smoother (at least on my PC), and that\u2019s it. You would say it\u2019s not much of an improvement, but I don\u2019t fault here because in my opinion the first game was amazing and just needed more maps to play, which HITMAN 2 brought!\n\nOn the other hand HITMAN 2 brough also faults of its predecessor. First of all there is the need to be connected to IO all the time and if your internet is slower for a while (or you are without it for a moment) the game stops you from playing no matter what you do and you just can\u2019t play until you connect again. The second biggest flaw I\u2019ve had with both games is staggering when aiming, I had no issues with FPS (stable 60), but when I aimed most of the time it just didn\u2018t react as it should, its just so staggery almost all the time!\n\n[h1] Summary [/h1]\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n\n\u272a [i] Perfect stealth features [/i] \n\u272a [i] High replayability [/i] \n\u272a [i] Large elaborate maps [/i] \n\u272a [i] Many challenges [/i] \n\u272a [i] Opportunities [/i] \u2013 offer guidelines that make assassination much more interesting \n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n\n\u272a [i] Story[/i] \u2013 even though some parts just feel and look amazing, overall it\u2019s just a mess. \n\u272a [i] Online [/i] \u2013 you need to be connected all the time. \n\u272a [i] Elusive targets [/i] \u2013 even though they are amazingly done, I can\u2019t stand that I can only play it once and then have to wait for another year! \n\n[b]9 /10[/b]\n\nThe game offers almost the same as 2016\u2019s HITMAN but it\u2019s large and more elaborate maps offer much higher replayability therefore I can gladly recommend buying this one and even with it\u2019s flaws give it a little bit higher rating reaching 9 out of 10.

That has not changed and Hitman 2 refines this even further to present a tight and compelling package with Hitman 2.\n\nHitman 2 truly is a refinement over its predecessor. The old saying of \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d really applies here. The sequel takes what the first did great and pushes it even further, even if it doesn\u2019t drastically change anything. The first thing that sticks out about Hitman 2 is its striking presentation. Much like the first, it has one of the cleanest, most aesthetically pleasing presentations I\u2019ve seen in quite a while. Everything from the menus to the intro sequences to the look of the world is so polished that you can see your reflection in it. I found it to be very reminiscent of a David Fincher film.\n\nThe game takes place over six locations, all varied and enjoyable. The true calling card for the new Hitman games has been their extreme amount of replayability. While I only played through each mission once, I only got maybe ten to fifteen percent of the total outcomes. There is just an absurd amount of ways that you can finish a mission that you could easily spend ten plus hours on a single map.\n\nEach level has Mission Stories, which are essentially the most elaborate ways that you can eliminate a target. The games gives the player great flexibility with this as you can play with it guiding you from point to point or find it out on your own, with no hints. This guidance is completely optional and can be turned off or on at any time to suit your preference. \n\nOne big difference from the first game is that the cutscenes are done through stills as opposed to full motion cutscenes. I understand that this was most likely done due to budgetary reasons as IO has recently become an independent studio, and while I would obviously prefer full cutscenes, I found what they did to still be done very well.\n\nPerformance wise, the game ran great for me at 1440p on a GTX 1060.  I ran it maxed out averaging between 45-55 FPS. I did, however, get some occasional freezes that required a restart. This was mostly when I was reloading saves.\n\nWhether you play Hitman 2 as a guided experience or as an open-ended sandbox, playing as the unflinching killing machine that is Agent 47 has never been so much fun. The replay value here is through the roof and IO Interactive has undoubtable delivered one of the most enjoyable games of 2018.", "timestamp_created": 1544244104, "timestamp_updated": 1544244112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.715709805488586426", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45804568": {"recommendationid": "45804568", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981638563", "num_games_owned": 2682, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 12559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1542899653}, "language": "english", "review": "So, [b]HITMAN 2[/b], ladies and gentlemen. To be honest, when they have announced the previous one, I wasn't really excited. Just because I can't stand the reboots and, let's be honest, those are rarely good. But you know what? Miracles do happen and not only [b]IO Interactive[/b] made a good game, they've made one of the very best games in the series. Instead of forcing us to follow a certain route, the original [b]HITMAN[/b] gave us a lot of freedom in every single mission. From our way to the target to the way we approach it, [b]HITMAN[/b] allowed us to choose everything. And boy, oh boy, there was [i]a lot[/i] to choose from. Unfortunately, there was that certain a-hole, who though \u201c[i]Hey! Let's split the campaign into the episodes and sell them separately![/i]\u201d. No idea who it was, but that's exactly who ruined the first [b]HITMAN[/b] and doomed it to fail. Don't get me wrong, it was still a great game, it's just it didn't feel as good as it was supposed to and didn't sell well either. So, after all that disaster (which almost sank the [b]IOI[/b] BTW), it was decided to make sequel a real deal. That's right, guys, we've finally got it. A game that comes with both the original [b]HITMAN[/b] mechanics and proper single player experience. Or did we? Let's see.\n\nThe [b]HITMAN 2[/b] begins with the new mission that feels a lot like a tutorial, or an introduction to the story of sorts. Remember, the previous game ended with cliffhanger, so, it's only logical. That new mission looks pretty cool, but it's also laughably short (only a few minutes long) and can't really be considered a real deal. It's just that \u2013 a way to remember the story and controls. After that, you'll be able to choose. You'll be able to re-play the entire campaign of the original [b]HITMAN[/b] with [b]Patient Zero[/b] expansion, or start with the sequel. Yep, you've got it right. The sequel comes with the full version of the original game. And if you begin to feel suspicious at this point, you're absolutely right. [b]HITMAN 2[/b] isn't really a sequel. It's... an expansion pack. Aside from that short introduction, there's only five new missions and the new story still ends with a cliffhanger. There won't even be much of it, especially since [b]IO Interactive[/b] didn't change the way of telling the story at all. If you expected the new business model to change something in the game, you were wrong. It's exactly the same mission \u2192 cutscene, mission \u2192 cutscene thing, while cutscenes are even more dull this time. In missions? There's pretty much nothing. Only you and your goals. Don't expect much surprises, or story-related stuff. The only good thing I can say about the story is the fact that we've finally got a proper backstory for [b]Diana[/b]. Which is a really good thing since in the original game she felt [i]really[/i] shallow. Everything else, unfortunately, is just a bunch of broken expectations. [b]HITMAN 2[/b]'s story is just a bunch of the old clich\u00e9. Secret society, [b]KGB[/b], [b]USSR[/b] experiments and a group of \u201crevengers\u201d. You know, our usual generic cheesy stuff.\n\nThankfully, there's a gameplay to make us all feel better. [b]HITMAN 2[/b] gives us everything that made the original game so cool and awesome. A lot of freedom, a lot of choices. It's all here. The problem with all that, though, (as you've probably already guessed) is the fact that it feels a lot like more of the same. That's right. [b]HITMAN 2[/b] doesn't even feel like [b]HITMAN 2[/b]. It feels like five... new... missions. And a short intro. I'm not kidding. [b]HITMAN 2[/b] is exactly how the original game's DLC was supposed to be. Remember DLC to the original [b]HITMAN[/b]? Both [b]Patient Zero[/b] and [b]The Sarajevo Six[/b] ([b]PlayStation 4[/b] exclusive DLC) were the same exact maps, only with slightly different goals. As the result, both felt a lot like re-playing the original game. [b]HITMAN 2[/b] is pretty much that \u2013 long-awaited five new maps. Sold as a new game. For the full price. Do you feel robbed now? 'Cause I sure do.\n\nIt's not [i]that[/i] bad, though. Because again, developers did their best to provide us an exciting experience. And when it's about [b]HITMAN 2[/b], there are two things to make us feel good. First \u2013 taking the alternative paths will feel good like never before. Actually, every path you'll take will feel like some small side-story. There'll be some exclusive dialogues, there'll be some exclusive cutscenes and other awesome stuff for every single major path. And, of course, you'll be completely free to do anything you want on the way. No so-called \u201cstory rails\u201d, no, sir. The new markers will be there to assist you with such \u201csub-stories\u201d and you can actually re-play the original [b]HITMAN[/b] campaign with them. Which will make the game more user-friendly and more intuitive without ruining the exploration, but again, you can clearly see that [b]IOI[/b] just keeps developing their game on go. The guys didn't even fix the disaster called \u201c[b]The Elusive Targets[/b]\u201d. The missions with no option to save the game, which, if failed, can't be replayed. Everybody hated them. [i]Everybody[/i]. And those were [i]so[/i] easy to fix. But guess what? [b]IOI[/b] just made it worse by making [b]Sean Bean[/b] the first target. I mean, sure, the winter is coming and the guy dies in, like, every movie, which makes all this kind of funny, but [i]come on![/i] Think about it! Everybody will want to kill him. And with all that \u201cno second chance\u201d crap... yeah... the winter is coming with a lot of hate. And, like I said, it was really easy to fix. Just let people learn some sort of special points on regular missions and waste them to buy second chances on the [b]Elusive Targets[/b]. Like, you know... let people compensate lack of skill with a lot of patience. But no, we've got the old crap all over again... But enough about that, I'm trying to talk about the good things here.\n\nAnother good thing here is, of course, so-called [b]Ghost Mode[/b]. Ladies and gents, finally, [b]HITMAN[/b] is always online for the reason. And that reason is... [i]there's a freakin' multiplayer now![/i] And guess what? It's awesome. Absolutely, completely, awesome. If you're at least as old as the old geezer here, you probably remember the game called [b]Spy vs. Spy[/b]. A [b]1984[/b] split-screen videogame by the [b]First Star Software[/b], based on comic strip of the same name. In that game players controlled two spies. One of which was black and another one was white (no racist jokes, please). The goal was to collect some items to your briefcase and escape to the airport before your opponent will do the same. The [b]Ghost Mode[/b] in [b]HITMAN 2[/b] feels [i]a lot[/i] like that. There'll be a set of randomly selected targets and you'll race your opponent to them, without actually getting on each other's way. It'll feel a lot like split screen... on the same screen. Kind of hard to explain, but long story short, it has that awesome [b]Spy vs. Spy[/b] feeling and I'll tell you what, the [b]Ghost Mode[/b] has [i]a lot[/i] of potential. Even if you won't want to re-play the main game for the alternative routes right away, [b]Ghost Mode[/b] will be there to save the day. It's absolutely awesome.\n\nSo, what's the conclusion here? The conclusion here, unfortunately, is that we've got robbed again. After all those re-releases of the original [b]HITMAN[/b] (\u201cThe Complete First Season\u201d, \u201cGame of the Year\u201d, \u201cDefinitive Edition\u201d), each of which offered more and more extra DLC, we've got [b]HITMAN 2[/b]. Which, is pretty much a four hours long [b]DLC[/b] to the same exact game. [i]But[/i]. It's a good DLC. [i]Very[/i] good DLC. And if you enjoyed the original game as much as I did, you should totally look for it. It'll give you a lot of good time.

Tools of the trade.\n\nCons:\n1.  AI. The biggest problem with this game. AI is very rudimentary and not mission specific. Makes the game feel more like a puzzle solving challenge than an actual immersive experience.\n2. No ripple effect after assassinating the main targets.  Invariably a bodyguard appears and says 'Oh Well! Sierra Knox is Dead..No big deal, i will just bag her and tag her. Adios. Finito! ' Nobody seems to care about such influencial targets being killed.  In this instance, her father Robert Knox just goes about his day as usual even though his daughter is dead and done with. \n3. Animations need to be ramped up. 47 feels like a robot when he walks or opens doors with just a touch and traverses ledges like a tin man. And the fiber wire kills are so fast and unrealistic. I cant even see the fiber wire when he is strangling people. The sniper rifle unpacking animations should be included too, you know where 47 assembles the sniper rifle after opening the suitcase, like in the previous games.  Also blood, where is the effin Blood developers??! \n4. Just make the game more immersive and realistic with the current formula. Look at Red Dead 2. IOI will make insane amounts of money if they just make it feel real, grim and more stylish. I know they have budget problems but now that they have a good working game, they can push forward, i guess.\n\nMy rating : 8.5/10. Definitely worth playing.\n", "timestamp_created": 1543603344, "timestamp_updated": 1543603344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680211186408996582", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45798784": {"recommendationid": "45798784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116109519", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 10730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "last_played": 1551813095}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Hitman game ever made.

Big fan of the series always supported IOI for their work until now..\n\nBut i don't agree to the privacy policy. If you read it carefully then you will notice that this game (plus their IOI website and your IOI account) is also used for targeted ads, tracking cookies, following you on social media and all that stuff. \n\nIt is not acceptable paying 90 bucks for a game just to give the permission of being followed and tracked and your data being used (sold) to 3rd parties. This is not about gathering general 'game data', accepting the policy goes beyond that. You give them permission to follow and track you and spam you with ads and if you use an IOI account then they will even use your real name, email, age and gender for targeted ads.\n\nIf you don't agree to this policy then you can't play online and thus you are locked out of portions of the game and won't receive unlocks/upgrades etc. If you don't agree you will have half a game.\n\nFor game publishers it is not enough anymore to simply sell a nice game and make profit from it.... they want your data and sell that as well. You can decline it, but then you can not play the full game. I call that extortion.\n\n\nEdit: Just to add, the EULA on the store page has no mention of this privacy policy and the restricions in the game it causes when you don't accept that policy. So you first need to buy the game (or DL that 'demo') to be aware and know the existance of the policy you need to agree too in order to play the full game. \n\nSo it goes like this; 'this is our nice product, please buy it. Okay thank you for your purchase! And by the way now that you have bought it, you need to accept this policy (that we didn't mention before) if you want to actually play the full game... '.\n\n\nWhat can we do as a COMMUNITY to not getting this type of extortion? sadly.. dont buy any Hitman Game. \nbut its for a good reason.. maybe we get a better type of game..\n\nPlease be respectful and do not be rude in the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nGERMAN-GERMAN-GERMAN-GERMAN-GERMAN-GERMAN-GERMAN-GERMAN\n\nVersteht mich absolut nicht Falsch, Ich bin ein gro\u00dfer Fan der Reihe und habe immer IOI f\u00fcr ihre Arbeit unterst\u00fctzt..

Sie als Spieler geben die Erlaubnis sie zu verfolgen und zu tracken, dich mit Werbung voll zu spammen, und wenn du einen IOI Account hast nutzen sie sogar deinen Namen, Email, Alter, Geschlecht um dir personalisierte Werbung zu zeigen.. Das man sich das gut bezahlen lassen kann ganz von zu schweigen..\n\nWenn du zu diese Datenschutz-Bestimmungen ablehnst kannst du nicht Online Spielen und stehst quasi vor einer Mauer an Content den du nicht spielen darfst.

Is it gonna change your opinion on the Hitman series if you don't like it? Of course not, but it sure as hell is one of the strongest entries in the series along 2016 and Blood Money, dare I say the best one out of the three, its level design being the strongest aspect.\n\nIt also has this: https://youtu.be/FKkT-T6rx3U", "timestamp_created": 1542133135, "timestamp_updated": 1543136955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.62187802791595459", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45810776": {"recommendationid": "45810776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201032514", "num_games_owned": 3241, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 15885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 457, "last_played": 1551732826}, "language": "english", "review": "For starters - I like playing this game, really, but I can't recommend this product, for various reasons.\n\nFirst one - privacy policy. Yes, you read it right. I don't accept it, but I have to if I want to play a game I've paid for. That's all I have to say about it.\n\nSecond one - multiple DRMs. Ok, I know why there are DRMs etc, but when you have preorder campaign for half a year, then week before release you add 3rd party DRM (Denuvo) it's basically tricking your clients. What's more, this DRM is not only DRM in this game, there are already 2 more, of which one is obvious - steam drm (and everyone agrees with that one by buying games on steam), 2nd one - always online requirement for the game itself. Now this might sound stupid - who plays offline? who has internet issues?? I think everyone has a chance for both. Better - IOI servers have it's maintenances and other issues from time to time, meaning you are forced to play in offline mode (yes, you can play) and offline mode means you can't unlock anything. If you won't be able to play online from beginning, then forget about unlocking better weapons, sniper riffles (there is none in this game unless you unlock it), new starting locations and outfits.\n\nThird one - why it is released as season 2? it is basically map pack (with some story behind it) over season 1 (Hitman\u2122). At the beginning, I thought the reason would be moving from Square Enix to Warner Bros, but now first part is also under Warner Bros so ... just why? To grab more money of course. True, this game received some upgrades over first part, but those are so minor, that if you've played first one and will receive free legacy pack (that's a nice move from IOI) you will basically do exactly the same stuff you did earlier. Changes like people being able to spot you in the mirror do not mean much, really. Far worse is the fact that they can still see you through concrete walls and closed doors (but there are some improvements over first version, now it does not happen as often).\n\nFourth one - game was advertised as having 6 maps right? Now I wonder, which map is more interesting and longer in terms of content - 1st one of the new (season 2) campaign or tutorial map copied directly (with very minor changes, like adding some grass ...) from season 1. Both can be completed in few minutes, but you have way more to do in original tutorial than this small, quite empty map. To better describe it - you are on the beach with one small house and you will have to kill 1 target in that house, then find your way back to your boat hiding in the grass. In comparison, every of the other 5 maps is really A MAP. As I've said, H2 is a map pack for original Hitman\u2122 (technically it's the other way around, with Legacy pack being map pack for Hitman\u2122 2, but you get the picture), so when developers advertise this game as containing 6 normal maps, like the first part had, this was basically a lie.\n\nFifth - nihil novi. There is not much new in this game in terms of unlocking stuff. Many items are just the same items - with Legacy pack (i.e. season 1 content) you basically get two identical Silverballers (but you can use only single one ;p) or lockpicks (don't make this red sticker with number 2 printed fool you). Real new items are e.g. throwable fish ... How Much Is The Fish?\n\nSixth - cutscenes in between missions (story cutscenes) are simpler, basically motionless, like a painted images, while in first part those were normal movies.\n\nSeventh - elusive targets. That's one of the main complains players had about first Hitman\u2122. Guess what, those are back. Now with real celebrities (like there was nothing better to spend time and money on).\n\nEighth - ingame issues. No, I am not talking about launch time bugs (like e.g. auto aiming, very useful while playing with gamepad, is missing the target a lot, especially with the ability to auto aim at fire extinguisher - you always aim below it, or bug with instant CTD when I try to play Marakesh escalation to unlock Ghost sniper riffle). Those are here and I hope those will be fixed. What I mean are some stupid additions to the game. First one would be overly talkative Diana. It's a bit disturbing. Second one - during one of your missions you will have to find a target, that is not marked on map, you don't know how he (or maybe she?) looks. You find the photo, then walk the streets to find him. Actually I don't know yet if it is possible to find the target that way, as I've found other way to meet him. Either way, the first solution was long and boring as each time you verify that marked person is not your target, new possible targets show on your map.\n\nNinth - difficulty levels. \"Original\" game had 2 difficulty levels, standard and professional. The other one was really tough as e.g. you couldn't hold items that did not match your disguise - soldier couldn't hold silenced weapon, sniper riffle or ... screwdriver). Now you can perfectly hold nearly any item on maximum difficulty level. Current professional mode (which is middle one) is basically the same as previous standard one with the addition of actually working security cameras. Btw. in neither difficulty destroying a camera would not interest anyone, while in first part you can be sure that there will be a guard coming to check what is going on. So basically maximum difficulty (higher than professional) is currently far easier than original professional mode.\n\nLast one is about incoming content. There should be at least 2 expansions. 1st one will contain single map (that's info written on graphic available from day one of preorder campaign). There is high chance that 2nd one will contain single map as well.\nNow compare, base game price - 60 USD / EUR to the price of Expansion Pass, that will contain both expansions (and only those two if there will be more) - 40 USD / EUR. We don't know about the contents yet, so it's basically another preorder, but you have to pay 2/3 the price of original game to receive probably only 1/3 of it's content. What's worse, if you've learned your lesson with first Hitman\u2122, then you know there is high chance for those new maps to be just skins over original maps and not actual new maps.\n\nTL;DR\nLong story short, enjoyable game for newcomers. It's still enjoyable for returning players, but overall experience is that you play the same game as previously, yet not really any better and for very high price.\n\nEdit:\nAh, I've forgotten about one thing. This game has only single map for sniper assassin mode. This thing was available early as preorder bonus. I've completed it (did not upgrade weapon to max, because I've expected all progress to be removed) and now I have to redo it all. But what I wonder is whether expansions will actually have any standard Hitman maps (I wrote about that above already) or only sniper assassin mode maps. Seeing as there is only single one, more are expected, but I REALLY HOPE there will be new maps or even reskins awailable in those expansions and not only SA mode maps.", "timestamp_created": 1542204176, "timestamp_updated": 1542217245, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664850175380706787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45859269": {"recommendationid": "45859269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114896908", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548860897}, "language": "english", "review": "Hitman is amazing.\nHitman 2 is more Hitman.\nIf you liked Hitman 1 you like Hitman.\nThat means you want more Hitman.\nAnd Hitman 2 is more Hitman, so you should get it.\nAlso, IoI always provides amazing amounts of post launch content!", "timestamp_created": 1542455359, "timestamp_updated": 1542895826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 130, "votes_funny": 87, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717155337333679199", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "46091549": {"recommendationid": "46091549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000861562", "num_games_owned": 3221, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 5054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547863229}, "language": "english", "review": "+Solid fun gameplay.\n+Interesting story.\n+Creative ways to kill the targets.\n+New Weapons & Locations.\n+Large open maps, even better then the previous game.\n+Lots of challenges, quests and funny references.\n+Replayability.\n+The last game included in this title resulting in many more hours of content, also improved the old maps.\n+Improved details and reflection physics.\n+Briefcase, also available to carry over to the last games missions.\n+Interesting multiplayer concept.\n+Contracts mode adding many more hours of entertainment.\n+Full game right away, no episodes.\n+Sean Bean is excellent as story-narrator and target, very interesting and awesome to see him in the game.\n\n-Budget cutscenes compared to the last game, but understandable to be able to release it in time.\n-Some minor bugs and some rare challenges that won't work until you restart the save.\n-The game can sometimes crash, mostly when you mess around or have played a map for long durations.\n-The online servers can sometimes have issues, only happend two times for me during launch week.\n-Progress doesn't carry over from the previous game, I have to do every unlock and achievements again.\n-No dual silverballers and no weapon upgrade system.

Having finished the campaign, along with the revamped previous content, I need to thumbs down this game. It just does not deliver in so many ways and feels like a DLC addition at best. We learn nothing really new on 47 as the story meanders through a muck of secret societies that even a conspiracy nut would snore through. The game feels older than 47 and the interface has too many issues to have been released as is. Sniper mode is a joke with a buggy interface that showcases just how rushed this game was to meet release dates. The contract mode is tacked on and adds nothing new, I haven't tried the Ghost mode, but am not expecting much given the current state of this game. Rather than put my feelings into paragraphs, I am going to list my pros and cons below.\n\nPROS\n\n- The graphics are defintinely improved with some impressive and well though out locales, but its nothing you wouldn't expect in 2018. There were games made a decade ago which look better, but its nothing that takes away from the game ultimately.\n\n- Its Hitman, same old game with few new angles, but its a good recipe so why mess with it? See below...\n\n- The addition of Enforcers who will recognize you no matter what was inventive and needed as the game is far too easy.\n\n- There is a consistent sense of dark humor to the game that just plain works without interfering with the seriousness 47 deals in.\n\n- The Mumbai map is superbly done and probably my favorite mission map to date.\n\n- Some of the kill events are hysterical and worth playing through missions multiple times to get that exact timing.\n\n\nCONS\n\n- The game relies on cut scenes and cinematics to tell the story of 47 in further detail, but I honestly cannot remember a worse story line. The cut scenes are so poorly done you lose interest in the supposed reveals about 47's past and you need to go through two every time you complete a mission. The cinematics are like anime stills with some moving parts like rain in the background, but it feels more like developer laziness than an artistic choice and they break apart the already loose tale told here.\n\n- With only six playable campaign missions the game lacks content to say the least, maps are reused in the other modes which would have been fine if there were more.\n\n- You cannot load a save game without beginning a mission from the start if you are opening the game mid mission. To quit you need to go into the menu and go to options and there is no map key, so many clicks to do anything in the menu leaves you sighing every time you hit F1.\n\n- Most maps have three targets which is fine, but the story's manner of trying to make sense of that is clumsy and was clearly done to make the game longer, with only six maps, what else could they do?\n\n- The inventory interface is just plain garbage, with a rotary interface getting to anything quickly is encumbered by the mostly useless things you can actually interact with in game. The map interface is garbage as well, marking points does not work and objectives don't register sometimes.\n\n- The game suggests you play the original missions and then directs you to buy that from the Steam store, for the price, this should have been included. Without that content you will progress through character levels very slowly and be done with the campaign in less than twelve hours.\n\n- Levelling offers more places to drop useless gear, more uselss gear choices and starting points so don't worry too much about it as the game is already insanely easy even with every help option turned off.\n\n- Agent 47's controls feel unwieldy and he moves more like a geriatric than the world's most feared assasin. Climbing in particular is done very poorly. When running full speed he is barely at a jog and when walking slowly he will still overcome NPCs walking, making walking slowly useless.\n\n- The equipment you are offered is sparse, with few weapons and reskins that don't change anything other than cosmetics, gadgets are also done poorly and are rarely used. Your default always includes coins and when anything can be thrown as a distraction - this makes zero sense.\n\n- AI is ridiculous, you can drop someone two seconds after they were talking with someone, put their disguise on and go back and not be noticed most of the time, apparanlty 47's voice isn't somethinbg anyone would notice...\n\n- The penalty for taking out non targets is steep enough to make 1/4 of the equipment on offer pretty much useless. There are no maps where it is guns free nor any mission where you can snipe until you reach a level where you have already played all the maps twice or more.\n\n- The voice acting is fine for the most part, but 47 sounds off to me, the primary \"bad guy\" sounds ridiculous and the actor goes off accent sometimes which is very jarring to the story.\n\n- 47 does not look right to me in-game, but its a small miss, the bigger miss is he looks different in the cut scenes and at mission end screens. Three 47s for the price of one, at least they didn't skimp on that.\n\n- Bugs: 1) certain disguises disappear when changed out of over time, 2) In the very first mission the target will clip into the bed they sleep in when killed making it impossible to hide the body, 3) Certain conversations will overlap and sometimes story missions will not prompt even after listening to the whole dialogue, 4) Apples? There are apples in the game which glow - indicating you can pick them up - you cannot, 5) Map bugs sometimes on objectives and does not show them. 6) Certain events that surround targets will sometimes bug out like a phone call that will make them move on a different path having no audio and the target will stay still indefinitely. 5) If you drop your briefcase to do something like knock some fool out it may disappear and no not because someone picked it up.\n\nUltimately the game is plagued with poor design choices and an interface that hinders enjoyment and certainly destroys any immersion, hoever, it was enjoyable to see 47 back at what he does. If you are a huge fan of the series and the above does not put you off go for it, otheriwse revisit the older games.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1542154851, "timestamp_updated": 1542154851, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649535238742828369", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45809770": {"recommendationid": "45809770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312492936", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545303055}, "language": "english", "review": "The free version only contains the same 2 ICA facility tutorial missions from the prequel, dont install and waste time.\nthe game is pretty neat tho.", "timestamp_created": 1542199672, "timestamp_updated": 1542199672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 98, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.755613088607788086", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49238545": {"recommendationid": "49238545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315585536", "num_games_owned": 965, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546033167}, "language": "english", "review": "\u061c", "timestamp_created": 1551142856, "timestamp_updated": 1551142856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668994784355163574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45808557": {"recommendationid": "45808557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157674478", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "last_played": 1551252234}, "language": "english", "review": "While many complain that this is just an expansion DLC for hitman, I personally dont feel that way.\n\nThe story aspect of the game is not that great.\nThe entire story campaign can be finished in about 4 hours. \n\nBut what keeps me playing are the several challenges each level has to offer. \nEach mission can be finished in multiple ways. \nDont even have to follow their rules, we can come up with ways to complete it.\n\nThe new gameplay mechanics are a nice touch. \nAlways bothered me that NPCs dont notice the character coming up behind them with a gun when they are in front of a mirror.

This isn't so much an entirely new game as it is \"season 2\" of the previous game Hitman(2016).\n\nIf you were a fan of Hitman (2016) this is a must-buy, it's everything that made that game functionally good along with quality of life improvements, more maps and two new game play modes.\n\nIf you were not a fan of Hitman (2016) this will NOT convert you into being one. \n\n----\nSpecific notes: game has some bugs at launch, so did the previous game, not enough to stop me from playing but if you are sensitive to such things, you may want to give it a month to sort out it's issues. \n\nThe story is absolute garbage, this is Absolution level of bad when it comes to story. Thankfully most of us are not really playing for the story and the game play is solid, fun and \"more of the same\" from Hitman (2016). Contracts mode will ensure true fans can get 100's if not 1000's of hours of replay from this.\n\nSniper mode and Ghost mode are still in their infancy, one map each, interesting beta test modes. I wouldn't rate them good or bad yet as they are still being developed, but what's there has me intrigued. We'll know over the course of the season 2 as more content is added if these turn out to fulfill their full potential, more maps for both are coming.\n\nThe main game is short (like the last one), if you are a \"one and done\" player, go away, this isn't even the franchise for you let alone the right game within the franchise. All of the value here is in the replay, there's 100+ hours of challenges already in the game and 100's more hours in contracts mode. No idea how many hours ghost mode and sniper mode will add to it once those continue to be expanded on.\n\n----\n\nAlso if you own the previous game you get all of it's content remastered here for free with the quality of life changes. If you don't own the previous game you can purchase the legacy pack for a discounted price (cheaper than buying the last game).\n\nOne of the best parts of Hitman 2 is replaying the old levels remastered.\n\nTotal content with legacy pack:\n\n21 normal missions (2 prologue, 6 season one, 6 season two, 4 patient zero campaign, 3 stand alone)\n1 Sniper Assassin mission (co op sniping)\n1 Ghost mode map (competitive \"Racing\" to kill targets, not each other)\n100's of challenges\nUnlimited contracts\n\nTo be added during the season: 2 more expansions (more maps/missions), more sniper assassin missions, more ghost mode maps, more themed challenge packs, 50+ additional escalation missions, and elusive targets (one time events)\n\nIf you want in on the elusive targets, buy now, they start November 20, 2018 and add a new one roughly every two weeks for the coming year. Once they are gone they will probably be gone forever. Not a huge deal as they are a tiny part of the game, but they are a nice bonus for those of us who play contracts throughout the season, the base game basically continues to be updated and expanded on.\n\nThis isn't just single player, it's single player with a community and seasonal content. Though you may want to join the Hitman Forums and not steams forums if you really want to be part of it.\n\n-----\n\nBottom line;\n\nDon't buy this for the story, don't buy this thinking it has real coop, don't be an idiot and pretend this is a pure shooter.\n\nBut if what you are looking for is season 2 of the last game (which was season 1), this is more of the same with some quality of life improvements and for those of us into contracts, that's enough for me.", "timestamp_created": 1542140954, "timestamp_updated": 1542881682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635308623313903809", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45911593": {"recommendationid": "45911593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028355136", "num_games_owned": 643, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545478723}, "language": "english", "review": "My singleplayer game does not function properly because of server maintenance.

Fans of the series where at one point unsure we'd even see a second season, thank all that is right with the world that we did.\n\nThe game features 6 incredibly beautiful and vast landscapes in which 47 can complete his assigned tasks. Similar to the previous title, although I can safely say these levels are much more wide-scale and have a much stronger open world presence.\n\nWhile giant beautiful maps where to be expected, I found one of them (apologies for forgetting the name) to be very similar to Hitman: Blood Money's A New Life. As pictured below:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1564131760\n\nThis had me overly ecstatic upon starting the mission, IO Interactive really know what their core fan base expect and they deliver every time in my opinion.\n\nThere's also new weapons and equipment, I won't go too into it as some of them are overly bizarre but I'm sure Hitman fans will be happy to know, the coveted briefcase has returned and can be used from the very first starting point in the game. This was a big issue within the community concerning 2016's HITMAN and I'm glad to see it's been rectified here. Not to mention, you can go back and enjoy Season 1 via HITMAN 2 with the briefcase!\n\nI've not had one single issue with connectivity, I've seen a few glitchy engine errors which are pretty much unavoidable and nowhere near game breaking. They're actually more humorous than anything.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1564131888\n\nIf I have to name one bad thing about this game, which believe me, is a difficult task.

Player has an ability to travel around the world to track and eliminate his targets with all its inherent elegance on the enormous sandbox locations. [/h1]  \n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n\n+ Stunningly detailed enormous levels \n+ Countless ways to eliminate the targets\n+ Very high degree of replayability, perfect game for completionists\n+ Game was designed to be friendly for both newcomers and experienced players\n+ Player can follow the whole story from the first season from here without launching the previous game, as all the missions have been brought here. All these old missions updated with new features as well.\n+ Lots of new stealth mechanics that are minor but they actually bring a lot to the gameplay\n+ Brand new awesome 1vs1 multiplayer Ghost Mode\n+ Challenging and fun stealth gameplay, not as hardcore as it was before\n+ Say goodbye to episodic format\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n\n- Requires connection to the internet all the time\n- It has Denuvo, that can be a problem for lots of players\n- Cutscenes have a much lower quality comparing to previous season\n- It feels pretty short if you don\u2019t feel like replaying the same level many times to find every single possibility and reveal every secret.\n- Unremarkable story \n- Voice acting issues here and there\n- Can be a bit buggy at some levels, forcing you to reload the game from checkpoints\n\nTo be perfectly clear, it won\u2019t hurt to declare that Hitman 2 is a perfect pick for someone, who call himself a true fan of the series and eager to know the story of Agent 47 and what happened to him next. This game doesn\u2019t bring too much of a new features or it doesn\u2019t change the gameplay dramatically, so it\u2019s better to think that Hitman 2 is just a logical continuation of the previous game. It brings six new perfectly designed enormous sandbox missions, with tons of possibilities and different scenarios to discover, making players want to replay it again and again, bringing lots of satisfaction.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]   \nThe story in Hitman 2 is not that remarkable, basically it follows the events of the 2016 game and reveal the Codename 47 secrets a little bit more, telling us how he became a serial killer and who was staying behind all of this. He meets a man from the past and that leads him to the answers for the questions that players can still have from the 2016\u2019s game. \n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1] \n\nSpeaking of gameplay, Hitman 2 brings us the fullest experience that we ever had, with every possible gadget and disguise. Player is the one to choose, either to make it clear and silently or maybe it will be much more easier to organize a bloodbath. Everything is possible and here we come to the point of understanding, that player is not able to see and experience every single opportunity that mission offers you in a single playthrough. Seriously, this game can be such a great satisfaction for the players, who are fond of completing games on 100% and getting a perfect score, there are countless of possibilities. \n\nSome of the scenarios requires player to walk around the level a lot and play a waiting games for a long time, before he will get the perfect opportunity to take down the target. On his way to the final goal, lots of victims can be subdued or even killed to get the needed disguise, documents they hold or keys to unlock specific locations. Well, it\u2019s a classical stealth game after all, so no surprise here, that players have to do this a lot, patience has always been the key in Hitman series, let\u2019s be fair. \n\nThe game literally demands you to remain calm and patient, as a minor failure can lead to reloading your game completely from the beginning, losing your precious time. Of course, player can save his game to not lose too much of his progress, unless he is not playing on the highest difficulty, where saving option is limited to one save per mission. Basically, the highest difficulty is something where the game starts to shine and it\u2019s a great chance to test your skills. I recommend to play on this difficulty after beating the whole game and trying every single scenario on the easier difficulty.  \n\nThe level design of the missions is something, that I can't stop admiring at all. Players can spend literally hours exploring every mission and looking for opportunities, enjoying the picturesque locations and completing the challenge list. Or they can simply open the menu and choose one of the scenarios, track it and eliminate the target. I really liked the way how developers managed to come up with tons of creative ideas of killing your target: from some tricky and interesting scenarios, revealing the plot even more to some accidental events, like short circuit at the most convenient and right moment.\n\nSniper Assassin mode is back again with lots of different scenarios, making players stay in Hitman 2 even longer and a brand new mode appears here as well, called Ghost multiplayer. In this mode, player co-exists with his opponent in 1vs1 competitive mode in one world, having no ability to interact with each other. They have to hunt down the targets to have a better score and win the round. I can\u2019t say that I was that i was delighted with this multiplayer mode, but it definitely can bring players even more fun, when they are done with everything else. Also, let\u2019s not forget that developers promised to support the game with Elusive Target missions, a time limited scenarios with a single chance to take down the target. The first one will be represented by a famous british actor Sean Bean - the guy who is not lucky enough with his movie roles, getting killed there all the time, so it\u2019s really fun how they decided to ironize on this fact. Looking forward to these new activities to spend even more hours in this great game.\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]    \nI can say that graphics is almost on the same level as it was in the previous game, maybe a little bit more polished. The only thing that really bothered me was the cutscenes, that confused me a lot, when I saw this static figures staying on one place, while camera was moving around the scene. I am not quite sure, either they were trying to bring something new with this comic book look style, or was it just a lack of money, but it was definitely that thing I disliked in Hitman 2 for sure. \n\n[h1] Sound [/h1]    \nThe sound was a bit buggy for me - at some missions, there were scenes, when I knew that I was going to hear a character talking to me and apparently, it had to be accompanied by a dramatic music on the background, but it never happened. Then after I reloaded my game from the save, this issue was gone and a situation like this happened around four or five times to me. Other than that, I can say that audio is also almost on the same level as it was in the first game and I appreciated how stylish music was, definitely fitting the atmosphere. Every single line is voice dubbed by professional actors, there were only few scenes where subtitles were missing for some reason.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]   \nShortly speaking, if you enjoyed the first game, then you have to grab this one as well. Hitman 2 definitely does not change the game beyond recognition, but I can not say this is bad. It just adds more experience to the game you love and enjoy, especially adding these new cool features. Six missions can feel a bit short and not enough, especially if you are not a fan of replaying the missions. It can be a minor disappointment with a plot and its weak cutscenes, so let\u2019s hope that they will work more on this one in the next game. And it also very friendly to the newcomers, so if you ever feel like introducing to the Hitman story, now is a perfect time for this!\n\n[h1] Enjoy!

It builds upon what worked for the last game (immersive systems, situational humour, Sapienza-style level architectures) and reforms what did not work two years ago (levels too grey and aggressive like Colorado or levels too schematic like Bangkok and Paris). The gameplay additions are limited but well-chosen: suitcase, vegetational concealments, tripwires. It\u2019s what a second season would have been and that\u2019s all I ever asked for.\n\nThe five new sandboxes feel more rounded than 2016\u2019s line-up, probably due to the general supervision of Torbj\u00f8rn Christensen, of Sapienza and Hokkaido fame. The levels are larger and more integrated \u2013 granted you sometimes wish for a bicycle or motorbike, as the walking distances can feel a bit tedious. The verticality of Mumbai and Sgail is one solution to this problem and it\u2019s what makes them the best levels of the game.\n\nThen there is ghost mode, which holds so much potential. The chaos and tension created by having to compete in assassinations under a time constraint is unique and makes for a lot of fun. I hope the developers will soon unlock this mode for all levels and expand on the system, as this mode could become a selling point on its own right.\n\nWith the predecessor being contained within the second game, new elusive targets and escalations being released weekly, and two expansions incoming, the value of this package is immense.

Then you'll like HITMAN 2. It's basically season 2, just repackaged as a single game because publishers don't like the episodic model. It's more of what you loved about 2016, only improved and expanded in subtle but meaningful ways. The foliage and crowd stealth mechanics, for example, give you more ways to sneak past NPCs and get around without disguises. NPCs can now detect you in mirrors, forcing you to reconsider tactics that would have worked in the previous season. The UI has seen a number of refinements, improving the clarity of your current status and making it more obvious when you're doing (or about to do) something illegal. The briefcase makes a triumphant return and is the most versatile item in the game, providing melee attacks, ranged attacks, distractions and the ability to store any other item in the game. The levels are just as huge and complex as the ones in 2016 and you can easily spend over a dozen hours in each one. They feel very diverse and more consistently interesting as well. Finally, there are way more voice actors this time so NPCs actually sound like they should in each location.\n\nIn terms of flaws, I can really only think of a few minor ones. I did encounter some bugs in my 50+ hours, ranging from broken AI scripting to NPCs using the wrong voices. These were pretty rare though and as a whole, the game felt polished. A bigger issue is the apparent lack of Escalation missions at launch. I've scoured the menus and I can't find any at all. Escalations were one of my favorite things about the previous season and I really hope they see a return here. Oh, and if you actually care about the overarching story, you might be disappointed by the lack of a conclusive ending here. It's clearly setting up for season 3 but if HITMAN 2 sells poorly, there's a good chance it will never be resolved. Finally, cutscenes have been pared back and are now closer to motion comics. They aren't as pretty as the cinematics in 2016 but I'm guessing they had to choose between fancy CGI or more voice actors. If so, they made the right choice.\n\nOh, there's also the Sniper Assassin and competitive multiplayer modes. Sniper Assassin isn't nearly as in-depth as the main game but it's fun and offers a lot of replayability. I haven't played the multiplayer mode yet so I can't speak to its quality. It's all about racing another player to eliminate targets as quickly as possible but I generally like to play stealth games slowly and methodically.", "timestamp_created": 1542796627, "timestamp_updated": 1542796627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590001761913299561", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45814616": {"recommendationid": "45814616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075543220", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549991131}, "language": "english", "review": "FIX THE BLOODY SAVE/LOAD FREEZES...THE GAME IS UNPLAYABLE...\n\nThe game is great, I love it, but why in the world do I have to download Hitman 1 missions and bonus contact for Hitman 2?
