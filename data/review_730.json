The Community:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]In ranked matchmaking, there are way too many russians.\nThis causes a loophole:\nif you're placed in a low rank, the only way to get out\nis to play with people you know. This causes the game to\nbe unplayable if you are alone, which is a huge flaw if you ask me.\nI want the game to be playable and enjoyable whether or not you're\nin a full lobby or just casually playing ranked.\n\n[*]Another effect of this is the language barrier. 9/10 of my games\ni have had the majority of the lobby being russian, which results in me\nnot understanding their callouts, and they not understanding mine. I\nam of course not saying that all russian people are like this, but in my eyes\nthe majority is. No callouts ultimately results in me losing a round to either\na full squad, or a full russian lobby.\nDisclaimer, there is nothing wrong with Russia.\nIts a nice country, i've been there a few times.\n\n[*]Your reputation is ruined, as if you're not communicating in their\npreferred language, they're going to -rep you, report you and tell their\nfriends to do the same. This results in you being put in a lower class,\nthe \"Lower Trust Factor\" class, and meeting the same people that\nwill report you.\n\n[*]There is no way of enjoying the game when you're\nput into a lower trust factor, as the only way to bring it back\nis by being positive in chat and not breaking any rules.\nThis, in turn means that you MUST be positive to people that\ninsult you in foreign languages, play music trough the microphone,\ncheat, spam and are toxic.\n[/list]\n\n[b] 2. The Trading System:[/b]\n[i] DISCLAIMER: The feature of buying, selling, trading and finding skins and cosmetics that dont affect gameplay is amazing. I love that valve has done this in a game, and i love that you can actually make money if you find the right people. [/i]\n\n[list]\n    [*] 7-Day Trade Ban. Once an item has been traded, it has a week of trade bans. This is an update i wish was reversed, and i hope that there would be a way to disable it, like they disabled the Trade On-Hold if both parts have a mobile verification sent.\n    [*] Fake Sites are everywhere. Steam should do a job of cutting the fake trading / gambling sites for CSGO, as this is a problem i and other friends have. If i want to gamble skins, i go to one or two websites. I recommend valve making their own, or making a list of websites that are good.\n\n[h1] The Good Sides [/h1]\nCSGO Offers immensive gameplay, customization and fairness if you ignore look at the flaws, and hosts undoubtably the largest eSports scene in history if gaming, and this will most likely stay that way. This is due to CSGO being a legitimately skill based game with minimal RNG. I have done testing of multiple esport games to get numbers of how much gameplay is skill based vs luck based. \nThe amount of points given to each game is determined by each category the luck lies in, the less points the better.\n\n1 Point = 1 Category of Luck needed to succeed, e.g. Bloom, Zones, Loot, etc\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Game[/th]\n        [th]Luck Needed to Win[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Fortnite[/td]\n        [td]9[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]PUBG[/td]\n        [td]7[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Apex Legends[/td]\n        [td]6[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Overwatch[/td]\n        [td]4[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Dota II & LoL[/td]\n        [td]3[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Fighter Games[/td]\n        [td]2[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CS:GO[/td]\n        [td]0[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nCSGO is at the bottom of the list, which is good.\nThis test has been done by me and a couple of friends where we \nall queued up into each of these games and tested how many times\nwe would lose due to bad luck. Every time we lost in CSGO, it was not\nbecause of Bloom, Bad loot drops, Horrible zones, etc. It was because\nwe got genuinely outplayed. How many times has that happened to you in other games?\n\n\nConclusion: Get yourself a few friends and hop into a matchmaking game. Get good, like really good and grind up to become a professional team, because there is nothing stopping you other than yourself.\n\n8/10.

This game hasn't let me down with any updates except for the free to play update which generally created an influx of cheaters and smurfs. However there there are more positives than negatives.\nPros\n-Very addictive\n-Better than games like R6S in my opinion as the game won't keep asking you to purchase more DLC's which is generally a downside to those who just want to settle into a game without spending much money.\n-Anything you purchase for the game has no impact on it at all. Skins does not equal win\n-Skins are very pleasing looking, really gives a sense of feeling luxurious\n\nCons\n-Gambling could be a problem if you're like me\n-You might end up spending a lot of money to look good\n-Influx of cheaters\n-You may face a lot of difficulties ranking up in the game due to premades, trolls, people with no mics\n-You might end up losing your social life/ not see your family for a while because of your addictions\n", "timestamp_created": 1551573456, "timestamp_updated": 1551573456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530201315879821777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49345197": {"recommendationid": "49345197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198856689601", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 24158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6257, "last_played": 1551831881}, "language": "english", "review": "gud game full of cheaters", "timestamp_created": 1551652615, "timestamp_updated": 1551652615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49326312": {"recommendationid": "49326312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198435343120", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 28129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3450, "last_played": 1551822831}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game", "timestamp_created": 1551576250, "timestamp_updated": 1551576250, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49340288": {"recommendationid": "49340288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198339812710", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 71586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3230, "last_played": 1551876535}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, couple of bugs that could be fixed to improve game experience. should not have made the game free as more cheaters will be encouraged to play.", "timestamp_created": 1551633846, "timestamp_updated": 1551633846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49332781": {"recommendationid": "49332781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083325626", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 36252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 748, "last_played": 1551854337}, "language": "english", "review": "I am finally done with this toxic game.

bothering a Valve employee (sorry, Jeep). Back then I loved it, it felt great and performed great and everything just made sense. Since then, Valve took over the game where Hidden Path left off and only built on it - adding more depth to mechanics and gunplay and even movement. I fell out with the game around then, as the focus shifted to being a little bit too competitive for my tastes (yes, I am a casual, and I'm ok with that).\n\nOver time I saw more and more flaws with the game that turned me off. Weird premium passes, sprays that cost money, skins that cost money, lootboxes. Even gloves became a microtransaction. While I'm not anti-microtransaction (I understand that long-lasting games have to make money somehow), I felt Valve's approach to these microtransactions became increasingly anti-consumer. And that's what prevented me from coming back.\n\nBut then something crazy happened: they shoehorned in a battle royale mode to cash in on a craze and made the game free-to-play. I thought this would be the final nail in the game's coffin, as I reinstalled it to \"see how bad it was\".\n\nExcept it was really, really good.\n\nDanger Zone became my way back to Counter-Strike. I ignored the skins and sprays and stickers and gloves and who knows what else, and started playing with my friends and having a genuinely good time in this so-called tacked-on game mode. \n\nThe mode is very tightly designed. Matches are kept small and quick, solving the big issue in other BR games where you spend 20 minutes looting copy/pasted houses in a map the size of Texas, only to be wiped out by some screeching 13 year olds. Now you spend 2 minutes looting unique environments in a map the size of a small island, only to be wiped out by some screeching 13 year olds. The small matches also meant quick queue times! Plus, they built a host of battle royale mechanics around CS's mechanics, instead of the other way around like every other game.\n\nAnd then they removed three player squads, for some unknown reason. Suddenly, I can't play with my friends, only a single friend. They even removed solo play, and began matching solo players against duos. This also resulted in much longer queue times, as people stopped playing it due to it no longer supporting squads and because of the weird new matchmaking rules. I'm not sure what drove this decision, but it actually did turn Danger Zone into the final nail in the coffin.

The sides are counter terrorists and terrorists.\nIn the competitive you have to kill all opponents or plant the bomb to A or B side on the map and defend the bomb next 40 seconds or if you are a counter terrorist, you have to defend the A and B side from terrorists planting the bomb and to defuse the bomb if it's already placed.\nThe game needs tactics and great strategy. \nThe game has 18 skill groups which are silver 1, -2, -3, -4, silver elite, -elite master, gold nova 1, -2, -3, -master, master guardian 1, -2, -elite, distinguished master guardian, legendary eagle, -master, supreme master first class and the global elite. These skill groups tell you how good you are in the game in competitive's. There are also skill groups for the wingman game mode. \nYou can get better ranks by playing the game. Each game mode gives different xp and when you have reached the needed xp level, your rank upgrades. You can be at rank 40 and then you receive a service medal of the year you got it and then you start from the beginning again.\nThe in game experience is quite duff the first times, but right after you know the controls and you've got used to the controls, the game is going with the flow. I remember when I first played the game and felt weird when I tried to run when the guy was already running. The game has only a walking button on shift. Then you cannot aim with mouse two button. Of course everyone knew that if they ever before played any Cs games.

I started well before CS Source came out, and this is by far the best version of the game to date.  Playing is a ton of fun and has a wide range of ways to play for all types of players.  Then why would I not recommend this game? Easy answer:cheaters.  CS has always had it's fair share of people cheating in any way they can doing anything to get ahead of others.  I can't think of an online multiplayer game that doesn't, people want to win, troll, or whatever, but CSGO is completely out of hand. Every time I seem to join a game there is at least someone wall hacking.  You can see it even on your team, people staring straight into walls then going straight where they need to go.  It's just sad.  I want to leave a good review for this game but I just can't I'm just done. Valve Is making a shit ton of money, for God's sake Gabe is a billionaire, but we can't have anti-cheating put somewhere in the game? They need to hire people just for the simple job of stopping this but they would take some of their money which they can't seem to get enough of.  Please don't buy this game it just making a rich company richer and a rich man who doesn't care if you having fun richer.  instead of spending a small fraction of what they make in this game they save their money and let us suffer.

Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.\n\nGrowth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you\u2019re a Call of Duty player, you\u2019re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it\u2019s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.\n\nPieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.\n\nEven in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn\u2019t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.\n\nConsequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.\n\nIf you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.\n\nFire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas \u2013 entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location \u2013 but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.\n\nUnlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.\n\nIf you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

This game is an absolute waste of time despite it's potential to be great and fun\t[/h1]\nCS:GO is, as I'm sure everyone knows, a very technical game that requires a lot of skill to play. some of the important things to learn as a CS:GO player is how to aim, and use different guns in different situations. Not only that, but also working on teamwork and communication, as well as strategy are all important in order to improve as a CS:GO player and climb the competitive gamemode ladder. It is thrilling when played alone, it is funny when playing with a friend, but it is the best when you queue up as a 5-person team and you do your best with friends and all learn from each other's mistakes and climb together. With such a great set up to be a great game, the gameplay is completely ruined with the overwhelming number of cheaters. People who use wall hacks, aim hacks, hop hacks, and many more. There is clearly a hacker in every game I play, not only because their unbelievable headshot as soon as you turn the corner, but because of how much of a notable difference there is when they are using hacks, and when they turn it off halfway through the game. Here is the thing. I understand that game developers have a lot to do and they can't pick out every hacker. However, something seriously needs to be  done when one fails to play a single game without encountering at least one hacker EVERY GAME. I chose to write a review and uninstall the game because of this very reason. Playing this game is an absolute waste of time and I have decided that I will stop feeling shit after losing 8 rounds in a row against hackers. The fact that the game is now free to play does not help with punishing any hackers who are caught using their hacks, because I'm in silver 4 and I've been seeing hackers since I was in silver 2. They use hacks and have their fun, then if they get punished for it, they get a new account and keep hacking. Once again, this game is an absolute waste of time.", "timestamp_created": 1551511404, "timestamp_updated": 1551511404, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score":

have never played this game i would give it a download. Its very hard to get in to you may not know how to play at first but watch some youtube videos on the game talk to some friends that play anything to help give you some help to get better. This game has a very big skill curve and skill cap, it will take some time to get used to i'm just now getting used to it at 400 hours at the time of this review. but please be patient you will get used to it. Play with friends, its so much fun doing meme strats with your friend or trying your ass off to win as many games as you can so you can rank up or just to mess around in some community maps. Which brings me to my next thing, community content (there is a lot) so many maps you can choose from me and some friends have done everything from, killing a dragon to 1v1ing with desert eagles, maps can make this game have more fun that if you just did the stock modes. now! For skins, i myself have some and i love them, if you want a skin don't try your luck in cases tha'ts not the best way, your just going to lose money. buy the skins you want from ONE the steam market. (This is fast and easy just search up the skin you want find the wear you want maybe some stickers and buy the gun EASY. Gun should go right to your inventory) OR from 3rd party websites cs.money is the best out there. Deposit funds and buy the skin and then you will have a trade from the csmoney bot and that will have your skin. One thing is to never trade your skins on csmoney you will lose money for that they have to make a profit after all. but anyways that all i can think to talk about so enjoy your new game that you will sink countless hours in to (even know steam counts your hours played) and have FUN!!!", "timestamp_created": 1551309088, "timestamp_updated": 1551361782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49377736": {"recommendationid": "49377736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198427661697", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 24504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 916, "last_played": 1551816835}, "language": "english", "review": "0/10 fucking shit ass game, keeps bugging and not fucking working.

On one hand it's one of the most refined PC games of all time. On the OTHER hand, it's a cash grabbing overly competitive shitshow. But right now I'm writing about how it's a shit show.\n\nWhen someone is breaking the rules for the non-prime status members, there's almost no way to properly report someone. Since there's no IP association for VAC (Will touch on that later) the cheaters will just come back and break the rules again. People whom are griefing will for surely never receive a ban and there's no way to stop them if they're de-ranking you'll just have to run with the punches because if you leave then you'll be considered \"Abandoning\" and will be banned for 30 minutes to a month because there's no idea of the CIRCUMSTANCES of that round. When you get banned there's no appeal process, you basically just have to wait the week to a month because some retard jumped in front of you while you were knifing and the last half someone jumped in front of your AWP shot. Then because of that the game is like \"YOU FUCK YOU KILLED 2 PEOPLE AND YOU DESERVE A WEEK AWAY\". To this day I've spent more hours banned than active and I spend 14 hours a day on a computer that I could be playing. There's always the casual, but it's so stupidly boring that I can't handle it. The way to improve this system would be to add a sort of Overwatch sort of system where a person reviews an APPEAL of the ban to see the true situation on that round. \n\nThe Second thing is the over-sized and unnecessary gap between casual and competitive. Why can't there be a gamemode that replicates Competitive as a 5v5 without friendly fire and lower XP and Drops. People could experience the 5v5 while not being able to grief or team-kill. Paying for armour and defuse kits make CS:GO more economic, in a way it works the brain and makes the game less boring.\n\nThe final thing is that the game could be SO much better. It has so much potential top be not one of but THE best game.

I have +2k hours in this game and I've had a lot of great and successful moments playing this game, but I've also experienced a lot of bad things. \n\nCS:GO is highly competitive and difficult to master which makes it a great game to spend time on and watch yourself improve over time, but it has it's bad sides as well. Imagine getting in a competitive match after a long warm-up session and just full of adrenaline. Your attitude is like ; \"I'm just gonna rekt these noobs easily!\", BUT..... You match against a cheater team that just destroys you, your teammates and your dreams. All that training, passion and intuition in the game is worth, nothing. It's just for nothing. I've experienced this just so many times, but I still love the game and it's concept and I'm able to enjoy it at least in some ways.\n\nValve has reported over a million VAC-bans in January and already 150k in February. That makes already over 1,1 million VAC-bans in 2 months which is higher than ever. These numbers are just because of making CS:GO free and and adding a prime-status in already existing accounts. It means that the people legit people, who had grinded the level 21 and got prime, are getting matched against cheaters. The worst thing is that if you have prime, you must play only prime and against the new cheaters. And when you add the trust-factor in all of this it becomes as an endless torture that never ends.\n\nNowadays literally 2/3 of my competitive matches are against at least one cheater.

If you want anything that looks remotely interesting, you need to spend money, or get extremly lucky.\n\nLet's talk about the kind of people you encounter in-game. Most of them are really antisocial and ignore any help you may try to give (and obviously don't even think about giving help themselves). Is it really THIS hard to not be a total jerk? If there may be someone using their microphone (could also be a potato in most cases) it's mostly to cause ear pain by vicious screams or similar to everybody hearing it.\nIn a nutshell: This game is a money-demanding, unrewarding and variety-lacking free-to-play \"game\" that revolves around sitting in the corner for the entire match or getting killed by people doing the exact thing and is played by all the people that weren't competent enough to learn what those odd words like \"communication\" or \"team work\" mean.

1.5.\nIt was in an Internet-Caf\u00e9 during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time. \n\nSome years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006. \n\nWe formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland.\nHowever, due to insufficient capacity (private life)  of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.\n\nI've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called \"CS Promod\" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.\n\nAfter a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again. \n\nCS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read).\n\nThough it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get. \n\nSince all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me. \n\nIf you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.\n\nHowever if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.\n\nI hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community. \n\nBest Regards\nKnight", "timestamp_created": 1540908357, "timestamp_updated": 1541107177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 319, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.919783651828765869", "comment_count": 33, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42293357": {"recommendationid": "42293357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110160497", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 155592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1833, "last_played": 1551830795}, "language": "english", "review": "You should do something with the cheaters", "timestamp_created": 1527374597, "timestamp_updated": 1527374597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 457, "votes_funny": 61, "weighted_vote_score": "0.912047326564788818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38587748": {"recommendationid": "38587748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158856532", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547811677}, "language": "english", "review": "1.

For some of us it has a lot of memories and childhood nostalgia. To keep it short yes, I would recommend to see what all the fuss is about if you haven't already.\n\nTo try and write something useful here is my advice to you, new player, if you want to improve:\n\n* It's alright you suck, CS:GO is a highly highly skill based game, don't sweat it. If you're not having fun sucking, though, you should probably quit. There will be a lot of sucking and it's OK to rage sometimes, but if it's constant no fun just move on\n\n* Get a good mouse specifically for first-person shooters. No, that Razer Naga you play World of Warcraft with won't do. Google 'Rocket Jump Ninja mice' for good recommendations from a 19+ years Quake player\n\n* Alongside the mouse, REALLY I mean REALLY spend the time to find your mouse sensitivity. It is worth it. There are plenty of guides to google\n\n* have a MINIMUM of 60 FPS, otherwise you're really gimping yourself. Personally I wouldn't play without at least a steady 100\n\n* No, you don't need a 144Hz monitor, I reached Global (highest official rank) perfectly fine without it. It is nice though if you can afford it\n\n* As with anything, consistency and practice is key. The other rarely mentioned but just as important thing, though, is TAKE BREAKS. If you feel burnt out just play something else. It's fine. You will come back fresh and ready to improve\n\n* If you won, but didn't improve - you lost. If you lost, but you improved - you won. Have this mindset and your results will take care of themselves\n\n* SoloQ is really as any other game, if you have a hard time handling negativity this also might not be for you. I personally just mute any sort of toxicity and that works for me\n\n* Get a PRIME account (reach lvl 21) ASAP and only play with it enabled when possible. The increase in game quality is noticable\n\nGood luck!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1538413386, "timestamp_updated": 1538413386, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 350, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.909561634063720703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30098605": {"recommendationid": "30098605", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961154798", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 329629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19921, "last_played": 1551876652}, "language": "english", "review": "IQ tests should be mandatory before being able to play matchmaking.", "timestamp_created": 1487768040, "timestamp_updated": 1542823861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 979, "votes_funny": 756, "weighted_vote_score": "0.925477802753448486", "comment_count": 35, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "44211313": {"recommendationid": "44211313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272317603", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 30003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545065992}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice game with a cancer community", "timestamp_created": 1534522832, "timestamp_updated": 1534522832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 900, "votes_funny": 450, "weighted_vote_score": "0.926638960838317871", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10853796": {"recommendationid": "10853796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046025467", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 31161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1522354442}, "language": "english", "review": "I've held this view of CSGO for quite some time, but have never found the time or motivation to publish my thoughts. I've been playing CS for many, many years - starting in the early 2000's through to present day. This time has seen me enjoy the game as a causual scrubber camping hostages, enjoying leveling my character in WC3 mods, smashing heads in deathmatch, surfing backwards, long-jumping, bhopping, played in quals for WCG, competed in CEVO and flew to different locations to compete competitively with my team in different tournaments. I've enjoyed CS from 1.1 to 1.6, CZ, CSS and also CSGO. No, this does not make me a better player than you, and no this does not mean I know everything, it simply means that I have spent a lot of time playing different titles of Counter-Strike, have played competitively and have experienced the good and the bad aspects of different releases.\nThere are a handful of things that really upset me with CSGO, and they upset me more so because these issues still exist two years after I have first played the game. These issues I consider to be game-breaking bugs that make it such a waste of time to play. I enjoy CS because there is a skill curve: if you want to be the best at the game, you simply need to practice and spend more time learning the mechanics of the game than your opponent - This was certainly true in all other CS games I have played, but not CSGO. CSGO feels like it is a game of luck and chance.\nAs the game stands, it is fun to play casually but anything competitively or MM is hampered by issues surrounding core aspects of the game.\nHitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when jumping\nHitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when crouching\nHitboxes do not follow the animation of a player planting the bomb\nAimpunch phyiscally affects recoil and is not lag-compensated\nIf you are on > 70ms ping in a 64tick Server, this is how most events will play out:\nYou see an enemy jump, you shoot the enemy and get no hits.\nYou see an enemy continuing to jump peak a spot, you have to time your shoots to shoot where his head is going to be on the next cycle. You shoot thin air, blood appears and you get a headshot kill\nYou see an enemy standing there, you shoot his chest, you get no hit and then he crouches instantly.\nYou see an enemy standing there, you shoot his abdomen and get a headshot (because he was crouching on the server)\nYou see an enemy, shoot first, die and get no hits. Watch the demo back and apparently how it played out was that he shot you first and your player aimpunched and the bullet actually hit the roof.\nYou are hiding in a bombsite and see an enemy planting the bomb. You crouch and take your time and shoot his head 12 times, slowly one by one. You get no hits and die.\nAll of these aspects of the game I consider EXTREMELY game-breaking. The fact that most people reading this will stop and think to themselves, \"Yeah, that has happened to me on a number of occasions\" just goes to show that the game is fundamentally flawed. In it's current state, the game rewards people for NOT AIMING - aka, \"good\" players in the game need only aim at the ground, run and shoot and they'll likely get a headshot, because as long as you don't aim AT the model that you see, there is a high likelihood that the server will decide you should have got a hit. The only one of these bugs that existed in Counter-Strike Source (pre-2010 OB update) was the hitboxes on the planting animation.\nAn example of a bug that I do not consider game-breaking, but extremely frustrating, is the spectator glitch where you are not able to spec another player. For some reason, after the last update this bug was introduced and it has now been 3 weeks and there is still no patch or fix for this? A feature so important to the game such as being able to spectate your team has been inadvertently broken, and after 3 weeks there has still been no patch? That is a huge disappointment.\nPeople standing outside a smoke will be full view to others with no smoke obscuring them, but the player's screen will be completely black. This was an unintentional meta-change when trying to fix one-way smokes, and this new issue has existed for months now? The game has been changed so much due to this introduction such that people holding a site need only throw a smoke at the choke and will get an infinite advantage as anyone pushing through will have seconds delay before they are ever able to see the people that can see them. Throw a smoke down, wait until it starts to fade, teammate resmokes - rinse, repeat and run down the timer. Retaking a site with anything other than a horrid oponent who can't capitalise on the blind-criple wandering through the smoke is now completely impossible. What a horrible meta change. Why has this not been addressed this was introduced some months ago?\n3D sound is non-existent in CSGO. It is not possible to tell whether someone is running above or below you, and more often than not difficult to determine whether someone is approaching from the front or behind.\nThis game has so many core issues wrong with it that completely changes the outcome of the game that it is not funny. I find it extraordinary that so many people are able to accept this game with all these issues, and there are few posts on this reddit about these problems. I see many threads upvoted to the top of terrorists hugging each other, but hardly any threads of people discussing the pressing issues which desperately requires patching to make the game both playable and enjoyable.\nIt'd be nice if people were able to draw the dev's attention to these issues and press for a resolution.", "timestamp_created": 1403830831, "timestamp_updated": 1407279580, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.770268619060516357", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45277094": {"recommendationid": "45277094", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966256904", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 141862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549452695}, "language": "english", "review": "The competitive Counter-Strike scene is at its peak.

It was a natural progression for me from HL Deathmatch which was a ton of fun back in the day also.  I've been loyal to this game for almost 20 years and have racked up hours I wouldn't even want to know playing it, but i've had a ton of fun with it too!! \n\nIt's funny to watch and participate in something as it evolves and grows, especially to something that has become so popular on a global scale and not only that, without CS I question if there would even be a Steam service.  It's funny how things happen!!  \n\nNobody will ever read this so i have no idea why i'm spending the time writing a review of this type, especially when i started out just to gain a credit for more XP, funny :)  \n\nCS and the community have got me through a few difficult times in my life and i'm forever grateful for that, but I have to say that the current state of affairs with the game, steam and Valve are a little sad.  There's no interraction with the fanbase of the game that made Valve and Steam what it is today, and that's very disappointing for me.  Valve own such a fantastic product but appear to have lost sight of their roots and where all their success came from.  The development of the game has lagged behind and if not careful will quickly become the way of the Blackberry (I was going to say DoDo but thought BBerry was just the same and applicable!).  Why has there not been greater advancement of the Source platform to take better advantage of today's gaming PC horsepower and reinvigourate a community that's becoming quickly displeased with the lack of communication as to the games direction, as well as current play-ability, variety and lack of transparancy?  If Valve have no intentions of investing the required resources and money into developing this sleeping giant of games into something that will see an explosion of interest, praise and thanks from the gaming community as a whole then...why not sell it to someone who will take it forward with purpose fans like me are crying out for???  Think about it and get back to me why don't you (and i'll be offered a job by valve to lead the team forward into delivering a product the community really wants - sarcasm).\n\nMy review won't be complete without touching on the current Steam vs Opskins, and the whole trading saga in general. Why won't Valve introduce an age bracket market for trading etc. that requires Government official Photo ID Age verification that removes certain restrictions like trading for and returning real money etc.?  There's so much potential there, the market history proves that, so why not consider offering more than one type of service?  It's a little shortsighted from ValSteam to not consider their market demographics are as varied as the number of games on sale in their store and have never really persued any course of action to capitalize on those different market segments, or maybe you are, or, maybe you're just dealing with so much legal backlog from the \"loot box\" gambling situation?!?!?!  Who know's?  Certainly nobody in the community, why?  No communication.  Is it because you don't think you're client base are capable of comprehending the current situation or is it because the majority of your client base are 15 and under and you don't consider that a worthwhile demographic to answer to?  A closing comment on this particular aspect of the review...Valve/Steam...please remember that every year that client base grows, so does the diversity of age and the growing expectations from a community you yourselves helped build, so be prepared and be willing to change or you too, will go the same way as the Blackberry DoDo. \n\nAnyway, CS is a great game and I'll always play it and just like every place in this world, both real and virtual, you will find the majority of people are good and don't cheat, but you also get the least desireable of people you find everywhere too and thankfully, like everywhere else, they're the minority.\n\nCheers\nChris\n\nP.S.

I click the library tab in a futile attempt to find meaning.\n\nMy list of games appears, showing me hints of open doors into new worlds, strange and wonderful. What path sould I choose? Should I join battle with Dragons, in the strage land of the Nords? Or, perhaps, I should launch the StarCitizen hangar module, and lust after a dream of flight, a game not yet finished.\n\nAh, but here it is; Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. How many hours have I thus spent within you, oh CS:GO? You have been the reason for many nights without sleep, many days of ragequits, many days of fun and sadness. I pull out a calculator from somewhere on my desk: dividing one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-five hours by twenty-four tells me that I've been within this game for seventy-eight point five days so far. Damn.\n\nThe game begins loading, and I hear the soft hum of GPU fans, and the silent sound of the sunrise, far beyond the single window of my room.\n\n_\n\n\nAh, where was I? I guess I feel alseep for a second there. Skip the intros, enter main menu, searc- Wait, what? 20 friends online? But, it's like 6 am... Oh, right, timezones. Eh, I might as well invite all these people.\n\nWell, I guess I didn't want to play with them anyway. Green light fills my room, I press accept, and wait for the ninth player. Who, it seems, never can figure out what the big glowing green button actually means. Oh well, it just found another match anyway.\n\nWell, third time's the chram, right? I guess not. Fourth time does it, and we're away. Cue loading screen, begin meaningless text I've seen only a few thousand times before.\n\nI get up, walk towards the kitchen, and only trip twice on miscellaneous paraphernalia in the dark hallways. The bleak windows of the room greet me: pale dawn, gray clouds and black trees visible through their panes. The neon numerals of the microwave tell the time as 6:07. I search the pantry and refr!gerator, but find nothing of value.\n\nI lower my standards and try again, this time coming up with a few tastless cookies of some kind. I begin a pilgrimage to whence I came.\n\nThe last stars of night grow cold and die; as color once again spreads over the sky. Monitor glow, winter snow, cybernetic flow.\n\nMy quest now complete, with prize in hand, I return to my chair. 0's and 1's stream across a fiberoptic gulf of space, connecting people hundreds of miles apart in a beautiful lattice of data, all for my enjoyment. I begin the first round, and purchase a FN Five-Seven and a Flashbang grenade.\n\nI move over to long A, and hold my sights on the old wooden doors. An insurgent sprints through the open door, firing his Glock-18 as fast as he can, his bullets hitting the wal beside my head.\n\nI pull the trigger, a volcanic plume of hot gas propelling a one gram lead alloy projectile at twice the speed of sound into the side of his head; The FN 5.7\u00d728mm armor piercing round delivering a fatal 540 Joules of energy. The neon Stattrak\u2122 display mounted on the left side of my Case Hardened Five-Seven increases by one, and a bright flare from the muzzle reflects its light in the cold metal of a name tag, the words \"NOT ON MY WATCH\" silently mocking those fools who fall by my pistol, in an absurd pun about clocks.\n\nAnother Terrorist moves into view, I fire three supersonic rounds into his chest, and one in his skull. Again the neon numbers shift and rearrange in a mad dance, as bullets enter my manly chest hair and are absorbed.\n\nA third Terrorist fires, and I die in the gameworld, madly shooting as my bullets hit empty space. Pixels shift and change in an algorithmic song, and my teammates finish what I began, with the severing of a red wire a small number one is added in blue to the top of my screen.\n\nSecond round, man. Time to roll. I got long-  wait, why are two of you going there? Nevermind, I'll hold Catwalk.\n\n_\n\n\nTurns out they decided to rush Mid with pistols. Poor choice.  I leap out of catwalk into mid as they rush the doors, electric blue pathways of fire traversing the void between my tazer and and the insurgent's back. He screams in death as I drop the now-useless tazer and unholster a Bizon SMG;  9mm rounds begining to sputter at 320 meters per second into the backs of my foes as a Terrorist pulls a 180 and flicks a round into my skull with his CZ-75 Automatic, punching through my helmet into the flesh beneath. I mutter to myself \"I fucking hate that gun\" while typing out \"#TAZED BITCH\" in all chat.\n\nChildish insults fly like eagles, soaring over skies of wire and valleys of silicon to majestically land in the lower right of my vision, proclaiming their wondrous messages for all to see. \"get rekt\" \"u suck\" \"TIME to die, amirite\"\n\nUsing the mighty power of a pistol save round, the enemy gains a round.\n\nFrom far beyond my drywall cube, a sun the color of a Helium discharge tube bleeds the first light of Autumn into a sky the color of Krypton: but here I am safe from its incandescent fingers, here, the persistance of color exists in the 60hz of my monitor. Perhaps tomorrow will be different? Oh, but I don't think it will.\n\nThe scoreboard moves with its own hateful volition, seemingly granting rounds with a heart of cinder and magma. Chaos lies within its eyes.\n\nFinal round of the first half begins and I press f1 to auto buy, supplanting my XM1014 from the previous round with an M4A4 Bullet Rain, tastefully decorated with a \"REKT\" holographic sticker and renamed \"Clockwork Assfucking\". I once again reflect on what a stupid name that is, and regret selling my Desert Eagle Blaze to buy it.\n\nSurprisingly, my team manages to hold a push at long. In the simultaneous push to cat a rain of lead from a thundering sky finds my face with magnetic precision, and in the downtime I skim through my Ebook library on my phone. I've been considering writing something in the style of Neuromancer or Ready Player One for awhile now, perhaps if I can find the right subject... Oh well, that's a project for another day. Translation: never.\n\nHalftime, and the tally stands at ten for them and five for us. I've seen worse. I've seen better too, but what the hell, this isn't hopeless yet.\n\nPistol round begins and I buy Dualies, partly just to fuck with people and partly because for reasons that I can neither explain nor defend I'm ridiculously good with them. Don't dis my Dualie skills, man. Just accept it. Like a wizard and his wand: you do not choose the Dualies, the Dualies choose you.\n\nI pop smoke Mid and rush Catwalk, suddenly realizing I hit the character limit while subsequently breaking the 4th wall.\n\nI slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 6:34, am. Damn.\nAnother night of Insomnia.", "timestamp_created": 1388525548, "timestamp_updated": 1410935251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2525, "votes_funny": 134, "weighted_vote_score": "0.876733303070068359", "comment_count": 195, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25288323": {"recommendationid": "25288323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194367763", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 44510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548608527}, "language": "english", "review": "You either die a 'Noob', or you live long enough to have someone call you a 'Hacker'.", "timestamp_created": 1472747429, "timestamp_updated": 1472747429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 501, "votes_funny": 647, "weighted_vote_score": "0.897529423236846924", "comment_count": 22, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45062717": {"recommendationid": "45062717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136297981", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 4045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1541353584}, "language": "english", "review": "Yelling at friends was never so enjoyable.", "timestamp_created": 1538511226, "timestamp_updated": 1538511226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 118, "votes_funny": 206, "weighted_vote_score": "0.881032705307006836", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38692777": {"recommendationid": "38692777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096826471", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 35659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549262362}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you like to argue with random people on your team?

I still love this game if it is not evident by the number of hours that I have on my account. But still, I have some critiques on this.\n\nThe Battle Royale\nWhen I heard the idea of a battle royale in CS, I was against it, they've never quite been my thing and the popularity of games like fortnite completely destroyed any hope that I had for battle royales in games. However, CSGO's battle royale does have some pros with some cons at the same time. Do take into account that I am biased against battle royales.\nPros:\n- It's a fresh new take on the battle royale genre.\n- Thing like escorting hostages add a great addition to the game mode as a way to get money whilst still being involved with anything around you.\n- The idea of choosing and seeing where others drop is a nice feature.\n\nCons (take into account I am biased against battle royales):\n- It doesn't fit well into a CS game, yes I understand that I don't have to play it but it does my head in that it's advertised on the main screen.\n- Ammo is actually harder to find than real life aliens, the fact that you pick ammo up 1 by 1 doesn't make this any easier.\n- Drones break if there is a ledge near where you are standing. I bought some ammo and the drone was confused if an inanimate wall was actually me.\n- The amount of actual shake you receive when getting hit is akin to an earthquake, given I had some fun with my friends going around and bashing people to the point where it's like the Negev in warmup.\n- Finally, it's a battle royale. You didn't have to follow this trend CS, even if it was planned a while ago.\n\nFree To Play\nThis is one of the more concerning things that I had with the update, CS is already filled with cheaters and can sometimes make the game so irritating that I've put it down for a couple weeks. As 3kliksphilip said its probably the game with the most cheaters (Does CS:GO Updates not entertain you) But now I have some confidence in their decision for making it free to play, it allows more people to experience CS and will most likely double the population which isn't a downside. The thought that Valve has made the game free to play shows that they have confidence in VAC and that VAC will learn a lot more things due to the games new state.\n\nPrime\nThis issue is one of the main reasons that this review is staying as not recommended. The idea that you can pay into prime and that people who have already bought the game will now have instant prime. This kind of makes me think that prime will be reduced to a standard trust factor match which cheaters are somewhat abundant. But if Valve is confident enough in their VAC, this shouldn't be a problem. However, the amount of cheaters who have probably been grinding enough to get prime on multiple accounts is worrying.\n\nValve in General\nMy issue with prime has nothing on this. Valve don't really know much about their audience. We believe that we are entitled due to the amount of shit they have given us in the past years (AUG Week, R8's introduction *solved quickly, nerfing weapon speeds *this affected pros but they can manage now, #HikoMissed). My problem isn't really with this, it's with Valve's transparency, they never tell us what they're going to do and expect us to all love their new idea like its Chef Boyardee's canned pasta. No one has really ever asked for battle royale in CS, we ask for improvements which are normally disregarded.\n\nIn short, I'm upset with this update, but not as upset as I once was, I still have faith in Valve although it is withering at a fast pace.\n\nResponse to comments:\n@PapaNotedVevo: Agreed that it makes the player base bigger, dislike the concept of battle royale in cs.\n@JustSqueeze: Cause why can't I? As long as I have skins and fun with my friends then who cares?\n@Count Chocula: H1Z1s peak player base was 150,179, it's now 24-hour peak is averaging the 3,000 range. This isn't good for a game, it puts people off from the original concept.\n@thehemmo: Yeah I agree with you now my man.\n@waffle.jpeg: I won't play it, I'm not being forced to. It's a bad addition to a competitive game and I won't play it anymore, regarding optimization, I'm glad you can run this on your 12 year old labtop as you said. And yeah I was probably wrong about the optimization thing, some of my friends with lower-end pc's still cannot run it. \n@RandyCo: Prime isn't mean to be something you can pay for, prime is meant to be for people who have played the long enough and deserve a place where they can play without cheaters, cool VACnet is enabled, I forgot that gets rid of every cheater ever, did you?\n\nI just miss source man, the games only full priced because valve can't afford to make Gmod assets free.

You must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies. Strangely, each character has the mysterious power to fire one or two shots without ridiculous recoil by very briefly jerking in the opposite direction they are moving in. \n\nWhen your character wears a Kevlar vest, every part of your character, except the head, are made out of steel. Therefore, the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head. This can be annoying at first, but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a character's body. \n\nThe Goddess of Guns can materialize guns in your character's hands a few seconds before a round starts. However, your character must pay for the guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have the right amount of money, the Goddess will flash a menu in your character's eyes, allowing them to select the guns they want. More advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money.\n\nMaps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places. Vandalism is a very serious crime in the Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists are deployed to stop them. Unfortunately for the Terrorists, they are dumb and only packed one bomb. However, the Counter-Terrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb, so the Terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend.\n\nIn some maps, the terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and low-level desk jockey in a building. The Counter-Terrorists have been deployed to save one, not both, of the hostages. In reality, this is just a thinly-veiled excuse for the CTs to murder the Terrorists while pumping rounds into the invincible hostages. One weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a \"Hostage Rescue Kit\", which somehow makes gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second. Perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your character's shoulders. \n\nOverall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on Earth. Even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with Parkinsons Disease, you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic.

Instead of building a better VAC system to help keep the game fun and fair, they give us gloves and game breaking addons.\nBut I guess if they made the VAC system better half of the pro's out there get insta banned and then it's bye bye CS:GO.  \n\nSoon 1.000 hours for me, never had a higher then 0.03\u20ac skin drop, a friend of mine played, gets a 250\u20ac M4A1-S drop with his first deathmatch... It's random but maybe recode it so things like this don't happen because it absolut BS.\n\nBut after all, I enjoy the game even tho 1/3 games gives a hacker and 1/2 games give a high chance of dropping you in a game full of russians.\n\nVALVE, fix your game like the PEOPLE want it:\n- 128-tick servers\n- Better VAC system, even tho half the pro's gets banned\n- Fix bugs in the game / maps instead of adding gloves just to get more money\n- Different servers for RU / EU with no way to mix those together\n- Fix those damn hitboxes\n- Add that's it recommended to have a microphone and have some basic English knowledge.\n\nGame: 8/10 Good game in general, could use some better hitboxes\nMaps: 7/10 Some maps just have so low FPS for people it's unplayable\nDev's: 5/10 Give a lot broken updates but fixes them more or less within 2 weeks\nServers: 6/10 Some Valve servers are laggy and they should be split between RU / EU / Asia / US\n \nTotal: 6.5/10\n\nWould I buy it again?: To play a broken game with russians?

Might as well make a review. I don't even know if this IS a review.\n\n> spends 1 hour writing this\n> nobody reads\n> :c\n\n[b]Counter-Strike: Global Offensive[/b] is a pretty great game.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n \nFirst things first, the basic rules.\n\nIn [i]CS:GO[/i], you have the choice to play five official gamemodes:\n\n-Arms Race\n-Deathmatch\n-Demolition\n-Casual\n-Competitive\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSummary of gamemodes: \n\nIn Arms Race, the player gets weapons not by the money, but by killing people. Each two kills get you a new weapon. At the final stage of the weapon, you will get the Gold Knife. Kill someone with it, and you win.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nDeathmatch, yes. In Deathmatch, it is like a \"warm-up\" or \"practice\" mode. For me, at least. In this gamemode, you join a server, and you just kill everybody you see, except your teammates. You can get weapons for free. There are also random occasions in which the game will tell you that a weapon currently has bonus points, and if you want to use that particular weapon, you press g by default. The person who gets the most points, wins.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSo next in the list, is Demolition. It is set to be a 5 vs 5 match. It also has 20 rounds. The first team to get 11 rounds wins, and it can even finish with a tie. In the first half, you play as a set team. In the second, you play as the other team. You cannot buy any weapons, but instead, you get weapons by killing people, just like in Arms Race. Money is also not rewarded. \n\nBut this is different: let's make a scenario. In (Round 1), you kill an enemy. the weapon will be rewarded to you on the next round. But what if you kill two in one round? You still get to advance to the next weapon, but you get a bonus grenade. For example:\n\n2 kills: next wep + bonus grenade\n3 kills: next wep + 2 bonus grenades\n\nGet the pattern? Yeah. \n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nWhat next? Oh, yeah. It's Casual. \n\nCasual is a 10vs10 game, with 15 rounds. The first team to get 8 wins, wins the match. It is split into two sub-gamemodes: Bomb Defusal (IIRC), and Hostage. Sorry, I don't know the exact names. In Bomb Defusal, there are two bomb sites. A and B. The Counter-Terrorists always have the Defusal Kit equipped, even if they didn't buy it. The kit shortens the defusal time from 10 to 5 seconds.\n\nThe terrorists can freely choose which site they want to plant in. The bomb, iirc, has a 45 second timer. \nWhen defusing / planting the bomb, it makes a noise. Of course, the CTs are trying to stop them.\n\nCounter-Terrorists can win in two ways: killing all of the Ts before they plant the bomb, or defusing the bomb.\nFor the terrorists, it's the same: killing all of the CTs, or making the bomb explode.\n\nSo in Hostage, the roles are switched: the terrorists are now the defending side, and vice-versa. As the gamemode says, the Ts are holding some people hostage. And it is up to the CTs to get the hostages, or kill all of the Ts.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nFinally, competitive.\n\nThe competitive gamemode is much like the Casual gamemode, except a few differences:\n\n- Each kill has 2x more money reward than in Casual.\n- Defusal Kits / Rescue Kits cost money, and they don't get equipped automatically for free.\n- It's a 5v5.\n- Competitive has 30 rounds.\n- Each half has 15 rounds, and in both halves, you get to play as CTs and Ts.\n- Like the Demolition Gamemode, the match can end in a tie.\n- People are much more serious.\n- cyka blyat\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nSo, here is my thoughts.\n\nCS:GO offers a large variety of gamemodes, and you can just see that I've written about all of them. Phew, that took a lot of time. Anyway, CS:GO is a very entertaining game, and each match has a different experience. Yes, CS:GO can be a bit too serious, but it is also a fun game. The community is not just a single person, you know. There are people who don't like you, and some don't care, but some will make your day better.\n\nGO is a game with a high skill ceiling. There is a huge learning curve to go in this game. \nIt's like chess. Easy to learn, hard to master.\n\nI've met a huge amount of my friends in CS:GO, and I still talk to them. Some, I don't. Yeah. They'll be grumpy at times, but they inspire me. There are some bugs in this game, but not too gamebreaking. Just a few small ones. Don't expect to enjoy this game if you have shitty internet. Ping matters. \n\nI hope you know that CS:GO is available for consoles, too. In fact, VALVe talked about having cross-platform multiplayer, but that would be unfair for the console players, cause they have a delay in controls. I am 100% sure that VALVe completely abandoned Global Offensive in the console. \n\nThe competitive scene is pretty huge, too. And a tournament even reached more than a million viewers! Online and in the tournament itself. It's only two years old, and it's already a big game. VALVe may not be the most listening, but they try. Except sometimes they make some aspects of the game turn to shit. Like the AWP. They reduced the movement speed while scoping.\n\nThere are also skins in CS:GO. Some care about it, some don't. Just a matter of personal preference. I think they're part of why this game is popular.\n\nThe most negative opinion I have, though, is about the Competitive gamemode. Sure, \"no game is perfect\", and the real fun is there, yeah, but the banning system needs some stuff to be taken care of. You know, just a few tweaks, like forgiving a person if he accidentally kills someone. It is pretty unforgiving. For who doesn't know, you can get banned for killing a teammate too many times, or leaving the game. If someone abandons your team, you can surrender.\n\nNot permanent bans, though.\n\nThe VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) System also needs some fixing to be done. Some cheats aren't fully detected, so the hacker doesn't get VACed. From my experiences, I still haven't encountered a hacker, but that's probably because I'm a Silver. Some people can be real dickheads.\nSo that's my review. Hoped you like it!\n\nEDIT: I missed a few points, thanks > SKaREO\n\nAbout the netcode of CS:GO, truth be told, it HAS been really bad... for a few weeks now in fact. I go up to a guy and spray him, but most of the time it registers 2 or 3 hits out of 8 for example which could be lethal. Take note, that's in close quarters. No, that's not horrible aim. In the words of a truly horrible player, \"omfg 64-tick sucks volvo pls 128-tick\". Eh, doesn't really suck, just... well, mixed?\n\nIn Global Offensive, there are a few advantages. Some on the T side, and some on the CT side. Hm, what's it called? Yeah, the perspective. Take this for an example, the \"left shoulder advantage\". \n| http://i.imgur.com/kVpjg.jpg?1 | Here's an explanation: the player models hold guns on the right side. Therefore holding angles or peeking with left shoulder is more favorable as your model is less exposed. TheWarOwl has this video to make advantage of your perspective: \n| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e8HZqF3cyk | And that's well-- unfair. Just like in real life, should I see your eyes, you will see mine, too.\n\nAs I said earlier, VAC needs some fixing. It's terrible. But again, I still haven't played with any cheaters, so I can't fully review this part yet. Thanks.\n\nFinal conclusion: an EXCELLENT game. There's bugs and glitches, but it's a fine piece of work. Go get it if you haven't already have it. Already do? Well what're you doing reading this review? Go play!\n\nBTW: CS:GO has gotten an update where the voice chat quality has improved.\nThanks valve!\n\nTL;DR: ayy lmao 10/10 cyka blyat \n-================================================-", "timestamp_created": 1427955656, "timestamp_updated": 1430921870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3003, "votes_funny": 1030, "weighted_vote_score": "0.873354494571685791", "comment_count": 86, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45245303": {"recommendationid": "45245303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063390595", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 160894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1983, "last_played": 1551803812}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.

You will visit some of the maps originally featured in Counter Strike 1.6 and Source, completely remastered with the modern day graphics and details. You will also get to hold some of the beautiful guns featured in earilier games, such as the AK, the M4, and the AW.\n\n\n-Pros : Competitive play and ranking system\nThis game is a competitive game, so people you will be facing will be tough and not willing to give up, you will have to use your muscle memory to control your fire and your wisdom to outsmart your enemy, as well as communication between your team.\n\nIf you like glory, then you will like this game. This game features a ranking system which fluctuates according to your performance in a competitive match. The Global Elite Rank (the highest rank) is perhaps everyone's dream, or for modest people, to become good at this game.\nIf you also wish to be a part of the E-Sports, this is the game you deserve. CSGO in E-Sports is a big thing nowadays.\n\nOtherwise, if you wish to be isolated from the competitive scene, you can play some casual gamemode like Arms Race, War Game, Casual, Wingmen.\n\n\n-Pros : Custom server\nModding is considered the afterlife of a game. Even though the game does not support steam pipes, it still allows servers with custom rules.\nMany community-made gamemode have reappeared on the server list, such as Zombie Escape, Jail Break, Death Run, Surf, and many more worth playing.\n\n\n-Pros : Market\nNot only you can have fun in CSGO, you also have the chance to make money out of this game. CSGO is known for one of the reason being the weapon skins. These skins are rare in the game and some of them worth a lot. If you wish to make money in the meantime, this game is for you.\n\n\n-Pros : A high skill celling game\nThe weapon system is a hard to master game element. After shooting the gun for a long time, the gun will point above the crosshair and makes your shots in places you don't want them to be. By memorizing the spraying pattern and have muscle memory, you will have a significant advantage over the enemy since recoil handling always results in either winning or dying.\n\nOther than guns, you will also need to depend on grenades to gain advantages over the enemy. Not only do you have to know about when to use them, but also where to use them. Studying the map is always important since you have to position yourself according to the weapon you are holding and where you are attacking/defending.\n\nThat's why this game recieved the popularity it deserves.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-Problems : Hit-Registration problem\nPerhaps one of the main concerns for seasoned players. Sometimes what players see aren't what the server sees, and thus where they're aiming and standing isn't entirely the same. This is because most of the MatchMaking servers are in 64-tick instead of 128-tick, something directly related to the players' aiming and movement. Therefore, where the players are aiming is less consistent for the servers and the players sometimes miss their shot even when they thought hit the target.\nUnless Valve upgrade MatchMaking servers to 128-tick, the problems will still persist and can potentially ruin certain people's games.\n\n\n-Problems : Inconsistency on the VAC system and concerns about cheaters and scammers\nThis game is notoriously known for the large amount of hackers willing to pay money for the sake of winning competitive game, and the VAC system is considered inconsistent and useless by pretty much everyone, so cheaters are unavoidable. Be prepared when playing competitive games, and report any cheaters immediately.\n\nMarketing in a video game also means scammers doing various tricks to \"steal\" money out of people, CSGO is one of them. With some of the item worth up to 500USD, you will risk suffering greatly if you're not careful with trading.\n\n\n-Problems : Lack of casual play with competitive game settings (5v5 unranked casual)\nThe official Casual gamemode requires you to play in a 10 vs 10 match, the other gamemodes include Deathmatch and Arms Race do not use competitive game settings. This may be a problem if you wish to train yourself for competitive play without risking losing ranks. (which I don't really care about losing ranks)\n\n\n-Problems : Competitive mindset and the player base.\nNo one wants to lose ranks (i.e. glory). So people in competitive gamemode will do anything to win (and not in a good way), from cursing and swearing at their opponents, to kicking their own teammates for their disappointing performances in game. There will be a lot of flames going off in this game, don't set off a bigger flames by doing the same thing to them. Instead, ignore or mute them.\n\n\n-Problems (negligible) : Blunt and plastic gun sound.\nI really enjoyed the gun sound of the older version of the game, but to \"reduce ear fatique\", the gun sound has been forcefully changed from familiar and satisfying sound of guns into something I really don't like to hear, which is disappointing because gun sounds are something I wish to enjoy in games.\n\n\n-Problems (negligible) : Does not support steam pipe.\nUnfortunately, unlike other Source games, CSGO does not support user modding except for custom player model used in custom server. For modders like me, I can't mod the game the way I want even when in community servers.\nAnd yes, you can't change gun sounds.\n\n\nConclusion\nSo is this game good? Definitely yes, it is a perfect game for competitive play and it is a game enjoyable.\nBut the problem isn't the game, but the playerbase and the developers themselves.", "timestamp_created": 1516720962, "timestamp_updated": 1519191884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 242, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.880367577075958252", "comment_count": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 852034, "total_negative": 119276, "total_reviews": 971310}}
