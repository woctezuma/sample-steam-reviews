It is absolutely phenomal and even a casual visitor (such as this reviewer) will likely relish every moment spent playing it, quirks and all. Any return to the Half Life universe is most welcome. This installment begins with the player loading in at precisely the moment HL2 ended. As you can imagine, this only helps deepen the immersion of the journey.\n\nThe story of Episode One is the driving force, and well it should be: storytelling seems to take on a new prominence, even for Valve. HL2 was one of the first games in recent memory that made so complete and compelling use of NPCs to really advance the story. The writing, direction and pacing of the story not only continues to be first rate: it actually gets better. That didn't seem possible given how utterly fantastic HL2 is, but Valve found a way to do it. Facial animations are unreal (remember, this DLC originally came out in 2005-6) and the voice acting is incredible. AND THIS IS A FREAKING SHOOTER. If this genre is supposed to inspire the feelz, shouldn't it be limited to excitement and anticipation? Not an emotional rollercoaster of tension, fear, relief, wonder and suspense?\n\nSpeaking of being a shooter, the level of difficulty is increased accordingly. While not insurmountable, those players who had been looking for more of a challegne should be pleased: Episode One returns players to a time when combat decisions matter. More use of the functions of the HEV suit (flashlight, oxygen, etc) and some good puzzles/lateral thinking help here, as well. Also, there is noticeably less ammunition. It's no longer possible to blast your way through EVERY problem encountered. A bit of finesse (or fleet-footedness) will be required.\n\n**But for all these changes, there were some struggles. At times, it feels as though Episode One shines a spotlight on some of the things HL2 struggled with. It was very cool to learn more about Alyx and watch her character develop. It was far less cool to watch her do virtually everything of consequence in the game. As a player, it's frustrating to have nearly every action (for story or game play progression) require NPC input. At this point, we've watched Gordon Freeman (the only 'theoretical physicist' who can single-handledly take out entire teams of Recon Marines, Delta Force-level goons, previously unknown armored alien vehicles like Striders and more) solve every problem thrown at him. To 'need' someone else to open every door for him, or tell him where to go seems a bit... contrived. Forced. Less fun. Advancing the goals of humanity was, until this point, a task left almost entirely in the hands of one person. But suddenly, someone else is required to help. It also seems a disservice to Alyx, as she is strong and capable. Does she really need Gordon to do these things? No, and that makes the relationship seem insincere at times. In those moments, it's not about seeing Gordon and Alyx struggle and grow together; it's about having a semi-emotional vehicle that attempts to justify itself as a means to shoe-horn the story forward. \n\nRegardless of the criticism offered in this review, it must be remembered that this content is still well worth the investment (in finances and time). That statement is true of any addition to the HL franchise, be it episodic, stand-alone or even only tangentially related (Portal, et al). Similarly, even with these few subjectively negative oberservations, Episode One is a part of one of the best, most powerful and enduring franchises in video game history. Not only that, but it is part of an amazing progression in storytelling, as well. Conceptually, the HL universe is compelling and completely engrossing. This DLC continues in that tradition beautifully... even if that beauty is marred by a miniscule, nigh-on microscopic blemish.\n\n8/10. Incredible. Episode One is head and shoulders better than many of its peers in the FPS genre. Peers that are full-fledged, core/base games that take tens of hours to complete, not a DLC/add-on that takes a mere handful of hours to play through.\n\nedit: 'not longer' is less awesome than 'no longer'. ;-)", "timestamp_created": 1496008953, "timestamp_updated": 1498781984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.838833451271057129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11960987": {"recommendationid": "11960987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030080447", "num_games_owned": 881, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1415161319}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]Half-Life 2: Episode One 1[/i] was released a bit over 8 years ago, as the even then long-awaited expansion of the original, critically widely acclaimed game. Since it is part of the Orange Box, the Half-Life 2 Complete Edition and the Valve Complete Edition, chances are great you already own and have played the original [i]Half-Life 2[/i].\nThe good news: [i]Episode 1[/i] continues on the high level of level design and gameplay the original had set. There is however an important shift in focus, as the greater part of the game is played alongside Alyx, Gordon's female companion-in-arms. Alyx happily stands her own against the enemy hordes and doesn't need any sort of \"babysitting\" games wtih less well developed AI sometimes call for. She's been updated graphically as well (looking even better ;-)) since Episode 1 makes use of the High Dynamic Range lighting effects first tried out by Valve in [i]Half-Life 2: Lost Coast[/i]. However, compared to that playable tech-demo, environments in Episode 1 are a bit disappointing and don't always offer the best opportunities for the upgraded engine to shine. There are no wide-open vistas, and although the opening level in the Citadel is impressive, it also has a sort of repetitiveness that comes to the fore now and then.\n\nOn the other hand, gameplay-wise everything is as top-notch as it was in the original game, and the fact that you play alongside Alyx offers some interesting opportunities. There's even a Steam Achievement called \"One Bullet\" which gets unlocked by playing through the entire game (!!) using one single bullet. The rest of the kills/actions has to be made by using the Gravity Gun, which gets an upgrade during the early part of the game. This calls for clever thinking, and I tried to get it, only to find myself missing the shooting action after a couple of hours ;-).\n\nAll in all, Episode 1 is a good to very good expansion, continuing the story of the original game in a logical and interesting way. There's no reason at all not to give it a shot (...) when you've played the original [i]Half-Life 2[/i].\n\nOverall rating: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1409687719, "timestamp_updated": 1409687719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 64, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.840824425220489502", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11399239": {"recommendationid": "11399239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097868707", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1387407713}, "language": "english", "review": "Alyx: It's a combine zombie, a zombine right\n\ngordon: ...\n\nAlyx: get it... a zombine...\n\nGordon: ...\n\nAlyx: ...", "timestamp_created": 1406263031, "timestamp_updated": 1406263143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 133, "votes_funny": 113, "weighted_vote_score": "0.872521042823791504", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12498838": {"recommendationid": "12498838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048023896", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417104723}, "language": "english", "review": "Episode 1 continues where Half Life 2 ended.\n\nIt's the shortest one of them all and adds a few new things which I really like for instance Alyx can only see in the dark if you turn on the flashlight and point it in some direction.\n\nA must have for a Half-Life fan of course.", "timestamp_created": 1413376547, "timestamp_updated": 1413376547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.767132937908172607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13838438": {"recommendationid": "13838438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002506911", "num_games_owned": 3158, "num_reviews": 227, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 86400}, "language": "english", "review": "Episode One picks up the story right around where Half-Life 2 ended.

We got that with The Orange Box and Episode Two wouldn't have been possible without the evolution the Half-Life architecture went through in Episode One.\n\nIt's evident that this installment is mainly about Alyx, her emotions, reactions and her relationship with Gordon. In the beginning, she is delighted to find you amidst the rubble. She is given a lot of space to express her anxiety about going back inside the Citadel to delay the reactor's core's meltdown and whispers your name at the very end of the Episode.\n\nShe is your companion and will stand by your side through most of the game. Her AI and reactivity were improved a ton as she is very helpful, moves away when she gets in your way, and you can count on her during the more precarious situations. In the chapter Lowlife when you are left wandering through pitch black underground garages, you will have to cooperate with Alyx by using light sources like your flashlight to illuminate zombies so that she can shoot them.\n\nThere are no new weapons, just the good old Valve creativity. They added flares that can light zombies on fire. Antlions now spawn from burrows that can be sealed with car wrecks using the Gravity Gun and a new combination of an armored Combine soldier and a zombie dubbed Zombine is present. Graphically the game's lighting was drastically improved with the addition of HDR.\n\nThe overall mood of the game is again top-notch. The landmark of Citadel is now a looming threat of catastrophic proportions. City 17 is more ruined than ever.

Like its predecessor, it uses training techniques to allow for a more fluid experience, and utilizes the game's physics engine to a full. With excellent performances by its cast, it's able to greatly explain the story of Gordon and Alyx escaping City 17.\n\nWith an excellent soundtrack composed by Kelly Bailey, the game becomes even more action packed, and the act of blasting zombies in an infected hospital with a shotgun becomes far more enjoyable, and the scene of fighting infected Combine soldiers in the underground becomes more threatening.\n\nThe game also includes Developer commentary in the form of a commentary mode that allows the players to listen to the developers' thoughts on everything from map design to character and scene writing, and includes all variant of Valve Employee sharing their thoughts on the game.\n\nIf I had to say I had any issues with the game, I'd have to say that it's fairly short, while Half-Life 2 is around 12-15 hours long, Episode One is around 5 hours long. That's not to say it's a bad game for that, though, as the story and game runs at a certain pace that allows for it to be enjoyed to the fullest; Replaying the game with the knowledge of how short it is doesn't damage or reduce the enjoyment of playing it, as Valve injects a great deal of fun into the game so there aren't many moments or time that is wasted, and every minute is used to its fullest.\n\nIf you enjoyed Half-Life 2, and want more, I greatly suggest you buy the [url=http://store.steampowered.com/bundle/231/]Half-Life Complete[/url] Steam bundle, preferably during a Steam Seasonal Sale.

Apart from the final mission, the entire game is kind of boring. \n\nThe gameplay is the same thing as in Half Life 2. There's no change whatsoever. There's nothing really new here it's basically the same game as Half Life 2.\n\nThe story is still great. But I think the events leading into what is Episode Two are far more interesting than the entire story of episode one.\n\nMy biggest problem with this game is probably the story. The game is kind of slow in pacing and it's a drag and not to mention it's also incredibly short. \n\nIt took me 2 hours to finish the entire game. There's pretty much no replay value after that. \n\nOverall my feelings towards this episode are still positive. This is as good as the previous Half Life titles, just the story is kind of boring, but apart from that it's a great game.\n\nFinal Rating:\n7/10 - Play it\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked the review post in the comments on what you disliked.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_created": 1446285425, "timestamp_updated": 1454102955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705435872077941895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18102341": {"recommendationid": "18102341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014163253", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 289, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442614829}, "language": "english", "review": "[u][b]-Quick Review-[/b][/u]\nHalf-Life 2: Episode One was Developed by Valve Corporation and released 2006. Not much changed from Half-Life 2, this game is a continuation and starts right after the events of Half-Life 2.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520555541\n\n\n[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]\n[b]Story:[/b] After the events that took place in Half-Life 2, Gordon and Alyx Vance are reunited and need to escape City 17. [spoiler]Unfortunately, they cannot escape before the Citadel's core detonates. So Alex and Gordon are forced to enter the Citadel to stabilize the core long enough for them to safely escape.[/spoiler]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520555575\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] There are only two changes to the core game: First, Alex's AI has been dramatically improved, so she is more helpful and not nearly as annoying as most NPC's that simply repeat the same phrases and actions. Second, you start the game with the Gravity Gun, which is utilized both in combat and puzzle solutions.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520555594\n\n[b]Achievements:[/b] There are 13 achievements in Half-Life 2: Episode One. Five achievements are unlocked by just completing the game, the rest are achieved by special circumstances. [i](like... \u201cbeating the game firing exactly one bullet\u201d, \u201cnot killing any stalkers\u201d, or \u201ckilling an elite soldier with his own energy ball\u201d)[/i]\nTo be honest, these achievements aren't very bad, this was a relatively easy 100% completed game, compared to others games.\n\n[b]Price:[/b] Half-Life 2: Episode One, is priced at $7.99, unfortunately the game is very short, and this price is a bit high for the amount of time it will take to play through the game. [i](You will probably spend about 5 or 6 hours to beat it)[/i]\nA far better alternative, is to purchase [url=http://store.steampowered.com/sub/469/]The Orange Box[/url] for $19.99, you will purchase: Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode one, Half Life 2: Episode Two, and Portal.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] Story: Still very good, but unfortunately much shorter then Half-Life 2. Gameplay: Pretty much the same as Half-Life 2, the only difference is you use the Gravity gun much more, and much sooner. Achievements: Straightforward, fairly obtainable 100% completed game. Price: Over priced, wait for a sale, or purchase the Orange Box for the best value.\nI recommend this game to anyone who played Half-Life 2 and wants to continue the story of the Freeman...\n\n[b]Related reviews[/b]\nHere's the URL to see my review for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/220] Half-Life 2[/url]\nHere's the URL to see my review for [url=steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/420/] Half-Life 2: Episode Two[/url]\nHere's the URL to see my review for Half-Life 3 ...[i](...is what I would say if it was released yet *sob*)[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1442681322, "timestamp_updated": 1442877989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676658570766448975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13526534": {"recommendationid": "13526534", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131348633", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1415395303}, "language": "english", "review": "The Half-Life Series has left a legacy for a reason.

It tells the continued story of physicist-gone-action-hero Gordon Freeman as he and action-hero-gone-love-interest Alyx Vance escape from the physically unstable City 17 before it blows up I think.\n\nIn my review of Half-Life 2 I definitely wasn't very nice to the game. I said the game was unfocused and average, with interesting ideas and clever storytelling but drawn-out setpeices and a largely uninteresting plot if you remove all that glittery facial animation. Some of that, I think, is still justified but one thing I forgot to mention was how much I actually really like Half-Life 2.\n\nOne thing the HL franchise enjoys doing is pulling the rug out from under the player and then throwing a bunch of enemies at them. That's pretty cool but it's also sort of troubling, considering that most of Half-Life 2 feels very aimless as if Gordon is just drunkenly stumbling between ambushes and set-peices. Episode 1 seemingly tries to fix that by making whatever the current goal is very obvious, either with some kind of environmental clue or with Alyx directly telling you what the objective is:\n\nEscape the tower\nGet to the train station\n\nThe story is more grounded and because of that the gameplay can throw you into as many accidental circumstances and detours as it wants because you always end up back on track. \n\nI also appreciate how the stakes are a lot higher feeling in this game. It isn't just a vague intergalactic business proposition between Breen and some alien terrorist people, the actual city feels like it's about to blow up and if you keep getting interrupted by the combine than everybody involved will actually die. And it isn't just your life that's at stake here, you spend the entire game fighting alongside Alyx Vance, which sounds like a bad idea but this game manages a sidekick-idea very well.\n\nAnybody who played the first game remembers the third act where you command a squad consisting of that guy who sounds like everyone else and a girl who only occasionally dreams of cheese(?) but nobody WANTS to remember that part because not only is it sandwiched between the two best parts of the game but it also is un-doubtably the worst. The AI blocks the player at every turn and is super reliant on Gordon; they will not go anywhere unless you ask them too and they die as quickly as your enemies do so they may as well not be there--heck the game is more fun when they AREN'T there.\n\nThe squad idea comes back in Episode 1 but not only are they more resistant, they seemingly abandon the whole \"Targeting\" thing--they seem to go wherever they want until you start to progress, and most importantly they stay out of the players way. All of this culminates into Alyx who not only follows the player from the very start but is INVULNERABLE to damage. This could make her too powerful but the devs fix that only giving her a pistol until about halfway through, and even before that she's a very good aim. Most of the opening is spent with the player under a variety of handicaps such as only having a gravity gun or not having a ton of ammo and the devs cleverly use Alyx as your second half, which not only ties their mostly plot-based comradery into the gameplay but also makes you feel like a real team by the end.\n\nUltimately I think Episode 1 expands on HL2 and makes the game better. There's only one new enemy and a smaller arsenal than before but the gameplay is tightened and the story in more investing. I'll be the first to admit that my review of HL2 was a bit hyperbolic but I still recommended that game and I absolutely recommend Episode 1 as well", "timestamp_created": 1467331697, "timestamp_updated": 1467332271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600805401802062988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25063729": {"recommendationid": "25063729", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988811719", "num_games_owned": 595, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472663012}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't call yourself a Gamer if you didn't play Half-Life.", "timestamp_created": 1471823992, "timestamp_updated": 1471823992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.6056557297706604", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21533673": {"recommendationid": "21533673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077817772", "num_games_owned": 1119, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456693127}, "language": "english", "review": "its a good but short (around 4 to 5h to complet) sequel to the previous hl 2, the story takes off after you blow up the citadel and your main objective is to escape city 17 and this time you will get a closer look at the stalkers and the strange alien like creature that you see in hl 2 and of cours it will leaves you with more unanswered questions .\nthe graphics, sound effect and the gameplay are just like in hl 2 nothing has changed except for the source engin i think ( it looks a bit better visually then hl2) + there is 13 easy achievements\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1456693571, "timestamp_updated": 1456693571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626901865005493164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10041430": {"recommendationid": "10041430", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985854272", "num_games_owned": 3708, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428563080}, "language": "english", "review": "An amazing, wonderful episode to the Half-Life series", "timestamp_created": 1399440340, "timestamp_updated": 1399441095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600094795227050781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14595853": {"recommendationid": "14595853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048029513", "num_games_owned": 319, "num_reviews": 120, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426780504}, "language": "english", "review": "Not quite as good as HL2 but very much worth a go.", "timestamp_created": 1424618842, "timestamp_updated": 1424618842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620636701583862305", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25173331": {"recommendationid": "25173331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154745351", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472328938}, "language": "english", "review": "What a master-piece, seriously, I have no words to exprese what I feel about this game!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1472265215, "timestamp_updated": 1472265215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581749081611633301", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38026993": {"recommendationid": "38026993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152366953", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512288081}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this immidiately after playing the main game and have to say that the pacing of this game has been nailed down to a crisp!

That's a sensation I won't ever be able to remove from my thoughts. I love knowing that there's something else behind all, but I hate to know that I'll never get an answer to my questions. It's a blessing and a curse at the same time.\n\n\n[h1][i][GAMEPLAY][/i][/h1]\n\nThe same as Half-Life 2: Excellent controls, movement, gunplay, and physics. The enemies are varied and the situations too. In fact it's due to the good use of the elements to create interesting and fun situations that this sequel doesn't fall into boredom, even with the absence of new elements and mechanics.\n\n\n[h1][i][VISUALS][/i][/h1]\n\nIn this sense it's almost the same as Half-Life 2. Despite the year in which it was released, it was still visually impressive. There isn't a big jump from Half-Life 2 but there's an increase in the details of the textures and small improvements in the lighting. I don't have much more to say, the game is excellent visually.\n\n\n[h1][i][MUSIC & SOUND][/i][/h1]\n\nThe incredible composition of the predecessor is continued in this game and it's incredible. As in the previous two games, each piece of the soundtrack is good on its own and is used at the right moments in the game, thus creating incredible, thought provoking, atmospheric moments, or tense battle moments. The SFX are mostly reused from Half-Life 2 so they are still just as amazing.\n\n\nIn conclusion, this is a very good sequel, however it's thrown back a little because of the lack of new elements or mechanics. Still, I personally enjoyed Half-Life 2: Episode 1 a lot and I recommend it to anyone who likes Half-Life 2 or is interested in playing the complete series.\n\nMy rating is:  [b]8.0 / Very Good.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1510023955, "timestamp_updated": 1514266693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541056156158447266", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28516336": {"recommendationid": "28516336", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084213372", "num_games_owned": 1400, "num_reviews": 120, "playtime_forever": 520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482355762}, "language": "english", "review": "Well its the first of - so far - two sequels to Half-Life 2.\nIts what you expect, if you loved Half-Life 1-2, youll love this one;\nReally short but a bit new gameplay mechanics and ideas, nice action and a continuation of the great story cliffhanger!\n8,5/10", "timestamp_created": 1482356097, "timestamp_updated": 1482356097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605083227157592773", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40793685": {"recommendationid": "40793685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148725591", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517099165}, "language": "english", "review": "4 hours of good sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1520966914, "timestamp_updated": 1521680461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.59330141544342041", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33918949": {"recommendationid": "33918949", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008303595", "num_games_owned": 863, "num_reviews": 540, "playtime_forever": 1626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501589138}, "language": "english", "review": "At first glance, Half-Life 2: Episode One could be considered a simple add-on.
