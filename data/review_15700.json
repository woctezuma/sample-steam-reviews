THIS GAME CAN BE DIFFICULT!\n\nBut, AH! The memories! :D\n\nThe protagonist of this memorable tale is named Abe. A Mudokon who was born a slave and works for RuptureFarms, a meat processing factory. One day Abe discovers that he and his kind are to be sent to the slaughterhouse. Not only that, they will soon become the \"new & tasty\" delicasy on the menu! He decides that he better make a break from the Glukkons who hold him captive and decides to rescue as many of his fellow Mudokons as he can along the way.\nAnd so, his unexpected quest begins! \n\nThere are a total of 99 Mudokons that await liberation. Some of them you really have to look for and there are a bunch of hidden rooms to find them in. Abe must rescue at least 50 of his kinfolk in order to survive the games ending. At times it can be a demanding task with little or no room for mistake to succeed. The game offers a very steep learning curve and rewards you with silly characters, enjoyable scenery, great music (which can and will become annoying when you get stuck), comical yet very well done cutscenes and most importantly, you will experience a fun and satisfying time overall.\n\nPROS:\n+ A hilariously alluring story line that draws from a serious matter concerning slavery\n+ Fantastic character design and visual concepts\n+ Nice graphics and animations (originally released in 1997 and it still looks pretty good)\n+ Lots of secret rooms to discover\n+ Innovative gameplay that will fulfill your desires for a real challenge\n\nCONS:\n- The save feature is not what you'd hope for in a game this grueling (you must reach checkpoints which means you better look forward to replaying strenuous parts over and over, again and again... and again)\n- There is no incentive for saving all 99 Mudokons (except for a video that was only featured in the original Playstation version)\n- I broke at least one Playstation controller during a rage quit \n\nI remember all the excitement of 3D gaming with the PS1 and still choosing to suffer this brutal sidescrolling platformer in 2D because the game is just so intriguingly awesome. One that still stands compelling to this day. I'd definitely recommend it. A replay even, for nostalgic purposes at least, if you're a gamer of the day.

I had never heard much of games, save the windows 95 classics such as minesweeper and the like. I remember the cold winter evening when I sat behind the window, about a week earlier we got a letter saying that my father was honorably discharged from the frontlines, and that he would return home.\nHe had fought the swedes in the attempt to secure Norways freedom. I saw a shade move into the garden, the sound of footsteps pressing their way into the wast snow on the ground. I ran to the door to find my father standing there, standing so proud, yet humble in his fusilier uniform, the musket over his shoulder, and a smile of joy visible through his thick beard. As he stepped into the house I saw a strange gray box in his left hand, a box that would later change my life.\nMe and my father played many an hour, many games with this gray box, but the first we ever played was Abe's Oddysee.\nIt was this game that I played in these dark times, and when I played I knew that some day there would be peace.\n\nIt also has a great sequel!", "timestamp_created": 1413723499, "timestamp_updated": 1413723499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.763262689113616943", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13004216": {"recommendationid": "13004216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124143479", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1415713273}, "language": "english", "review": "Nostalgia is 20/20.

With that said, I played this beauty as a bab back on the good ol' Playstation One and, to this day, find it a difficult game, particularly if you want to get the \"good ending\" for this game. The game can be played with a keyboard, but I've always been more comfortable playing with a controller. The only negative thing I have to say about this game is that it doesn't have a quick-save system, leading to some frustration following deaths. Otherwise, here's what I love about Abe's Oddysee:\n\n+ Great atmosphere, which has been tied together with an amazing, ambient soundtrack with beautiful background pieces that were hand-drawn.\n+ Enjoyable, interesting characters and enemies, paired with some great sprite work and sprite animations.\n+ Tiled-based movement system that controls perfectly.\n+ Challenging platforming segments coupled with difficult puzzles in order to save your fellow Mudoken brethren.\n+ Great looking cutcenes with equally amusing voice acting.\n+ Command system (\"game speak\") is an interestingly quirky mechanic, as well as the possession system.\n+ Odd", "timestamp_created": 1505872900, "timestamp_updated": 1505872900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.650032520294189453", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25716634": {"recommendationid": "25716634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066831208", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520222965}, "language": "english", "review": "This game brings back so much nostalgia.

An immersive and unique atmosphere is mixed with challenging yet rewarding gameplay, based around escaping from the homicidal Glukkon capitalists running Rupture Farms and then building up your powers to get revenge on them and free your Mudokon brethren.\n\nThe gameplay doesn't disappoint: as would be expected with the game that pretty much launched the Oddworld franchise up there with the other big players at the time. Whilst there's some action elements, like when you're running away from the Slig guards and their hounds or using your psychic powers to make your enemies brutally massacre each other, it's really a puzzle game at heart. The protagonist Abe is not a fighter and must rely on his wits and indirect abilities to outsmart a small army as well as the various beasts lurking in the wilderness. You can breeze through the introductory section fairly easy using the basic interaction and stealth skills, but later on when you're doing things like navigating ancient temples you can be ages stuck in small chambers just trying to work out how to get past an obstacle without getting ripped to shreds. \n\nThe visuals hold up as well- it's insane to think that this game is coming up for twenty years old in September. The art style remains gorgeous with a lot of soul and the sprites have nice animations and character. The controls are also relatively decent- it takes a while to get the hang of aspects like sprint-jumping with precision and utilising the throwing mechanic, but once you've tried it a few hundred times you get fairly accurate with it. Something also worth noting is the soundtrack and voice acting, both of which add a lot of the atmosphere and make for fine listening.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game. The sequel, Abe's Exoddus, is essentially more of the same with a few added mechanics like being able to control Glukkons or issue more commands to your Mudokon followers- so I'd also recommend that title if you're into this one. There's also a remake of this game floating around, New N' Tasty: it has some good things going for it like HD 3D environments and more Mudokons to save, but honestly I prefer the original because it retains a certain something that the remake just doesn't seem to have.

It's a shaky port though, so new players would probably be better off checking out Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty instead (the modern remake), as It likely won't be the same without the nostalgia.\n\nGreat game. Naff port.\n\nFor the masochistic among us who spent our childhood watching Abe repeatedly get shot/eaten/crushed/fall hilariously down a massive ravine; and yet somehow still save all 99 Mudokons and want to relive that brutality again... 3 things to beware of that haven't translated well from the PlayStation version to PC:\n\n[list]\n    [*]Overall game speed is faster (maybe 20%?)... And, as any veteran will tell you, the last thing meat saws need is more oomph...\n\n    [*]Controller mapping is shaky - We've lost the L2/R2 buttons where it doesn't recognise the triggers on most controllers. It's also a sod to configure as well, unless you know which is button 1, 2, 3, 4... Not unworkable, but fiddly and takes some getting used to.\n\n    [*]The game stretches to full screen... which [i]really[/i] doesn't flatter it. I'd personally prefer the option to let it retain its native resolution and run with the black sidebars (akin to the screenshots on the store page).\n[/list]\n\nIt's a shame the port doesn't do it justice, as the game is an utterly stellar stealth-and-rescue platformer. You're stuck as a slave at the bottom of the food chain and have to escape the clutches of the Magog Cartel before you become their latest ready-meal. Outgunned, you purely have to use your wits to escape. But it gets better... You also have to save your friends too. And so ensues a frustrating Lemmings-like rescue where you have to ensure that [i]they[/i] don't get shot too... or aimlessly walk into a landmine.\n\nYou think Dark Souls is brutal? Kid... you ain't seen nothing yet...\n\nBut you get the beautiful taste of retaliation too. Play with grenades, use your enemy's own traps against them... or better still, possess them and have them wreak the carnage for you. Play it well and you might even be able to gain enough powers to blast them to ashes...\n\nIt's a wonderfully challenging platformer: Requiring as much precision and fast reflexes as it does puzzle solving. It's all about looking at the level you are in and how best to use it to your advantage. It does have a few flaws though (thankfully fixed in its successor, Abe's Exoddus): Whilst you (graciously) have infinite lives and frequent checkpoints, the lack of quick save can make some fiddly areas an absolute ball ache. You also tend to need a strategy guide to find all of the hidden areas, as there aren't any sneaky tell-tale markers you can look out for.\n\nIt's just a shame the port is so scrappy. It's not unplayable... but it's certainly hard work, and nostalgia can only get you so far.", "timestamp_created": 1495386976, "timestamp_updated": 1495387053, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714897751808166504", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14806619": {"recommendationid": "14806619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131063201", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468904131}, "language": "english", "review": "My first time playing this game and i must say, i am blown away! the only thing i could remember from an oddworld game is munch's oddysee trailer from somewhere on the first xbox.

In fact, i dont think I ever even got around to getting out of the first area, Rupture Farms. But Oddworld: Abe's Odysee was always one of those games I always held in high esteem and put alongside my favourites of all time. I think some of you have that sort of game as well, a game you never managed to finish but you still consider a favourite. \nBut the memories always stuck with me, it left a mark that Im certain influenced my taste in videogames to come. So after all these years, I decided to finally get some closure and fullfill this love by actually finishing the game.\nStarting the game, its easy to see why this game manages to leave such an impression on the people who play it. After all these years, it still retains some of the best worldbuilding, art design, background art and characterization I have ever seen in a videogame. In a few short minutes, everything you need to know bout this world, story and characters is introduced and soon enough you are thrown into the thick of it without handholding.\nAs a slave fugitive, your quest is to escape the dystopian farm that has enslaved you before they turn you into one of their own products for consumption. You control an unlikely hero, Abe, who doesnt possess any offensive actions whatsoever, besides the ability to possess certain enemies.\nThis being a cinematic platformer (in the vein of games like Another World and Flashback), most of the challenge of the game is in assessing the situations that present themselves on each screen and maneuvering Abe's realistic animations in an attempt to reach the next alive. It's not so much a game about knowing how to jump on platforms, but about solving puzzles by jumping on platforms. There are definitely some cases of trial and error, but for the trained eye and observant player, there are always signs on the screen of how things will play out and if you are smart enough to catch them you can always get a small chance to escape death.\n And make no mistake, you will die. Alot. One of the greatest aspects of the game is in how it makes you feel each death. The goofy Abe face that greets you on the title screen might trick you into thinking this a kiddy game, but the violence is as realistic as it gets. The game is riddled with beasts that will hunt you down, patrolling guards that will pulverize you with rifles, mines that will blow you up on contact, bombs that will explode if you pass by the security laser, etc. Every single death in this game drives the thematic oppression home, and it really turns the game into a very unique and uncomfortable experience.\nWhich makes the small victories all that more rewarding. Figuring out a solution to a challenging section and managing to surpass it while a ravaging beast chases you down and you escape in the nick of time is frankly an experience that not many games are able to achieve, not even the ones who have to rely on scripted events. And Abe's Odysee is filled with these experiences.\nBesides the obvious dystopian subject matter, Abe's Odyssee also deals with themes of nature preservation and ecosystem  balance. Playing this now, I got the chance to leave Rupture Farms and explore the alien wildlife of Oddworld, and here the game really manages to contrast the beauty of nature versus the depravity of the factory, all without much exposition or beating you over the head. Even outside the factory, the world is still dangerous and vicious, but the presentation of the backgrounds and ambient soundtrack bring out this sense of peace and equilibrium that is sorely missing in Rupture Farms, the place you know you will have to go back to again to save your fellow Mundokon friends.\nI can safely say that Oddworld: Abe's Odysee definitely stands the test of time. Its a beautiful game that offers a fair and memorable challenge with the perfect duration. I am now reassured of my adoration for this game and it gets my Certified Classic seal of approval.

Like games with lots of secrets? Need a challenge? Then Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee is the game for you. Abe's Oddysee is a 2D sidescrolling cinematic platformer/puzzle game (phew!) with some interesting twists. \n\nStory: You are Abe, a mudokon who works on Rupture Farms. Abe lives a great life, despite being a slave. One day, while roaming the area, Abe finds that Glukkons (the scumbag rich species of Oddworld) want to turn mudokons into food. Abe, finding that out, decides that the best thing to do is save the 99 mudokons in Rupture Farms. Your journey won't be easy, because deadly enemies are almost everywhere.\n\nGameplay: As I said before, this is a 2D platformer. The game is divided in screens (fixed camera, i,e., go to the right edge of the screen and it moves to the next camera/play area). This system gives the player a sense of suspense, because you never know what's in the next screen. One of the powers Abe has is possessing his enemies. Press the button, wait some seconds, you are controlling the enemy. You can do almost everything with him (kill him, kill other enemies, pull levers, fall off a cliff, you name it!) and it's an helpful power to finish your journey. There is a basic speaking system called GameSpeak that allows to control other mudokons using basic sentences (Hi!, Follow me, wait and even farting!). Mudokons must be moved using this system and taken to the nearest bird portal. Just chant and voila! The portal opens and they're saved! (:D) Unless... they trip on a mine. ( :( ) The only problem this game has in terms of gameplay is that checkpoints are infrequent and sometimes you will have to do same thing again and again only to die in the same place.\n\nGraphics: Even though some screens look 3D, they are actually pre-rendered. The environments are beautiful and varied.\n\nSound: The soundtrack adds to the atmosphere, and the sound effects are pretty good.\n\nFinal thoughts: Despite the somewhat dated graphics, Oddworld is an amazing game. The story is amazing, the gameplay is easy to learn and hard to master, and the soundtrack is pretty good.\n\n** If you are playing this game in Windows Vista, 7 or 8, be sure to download this and put in the game's folder.

The story is a fantastic example of handling serious issues without being preachy, never forgetting to be fun and amusing.

The game is not without its trial and error, for sure, and this game lacks the quicksave option of Exoddus. I've heard some describe its challenge as ranging from \"unreasonable\" to \"impossible.\" On the front of the old PlayStation jewel case, you'll even see it blantantly say it has \"inexplicably challenging gameplay,\" and all you have to deal with that is a functional brain and infinite lives (you'll need them.) Oh, and magical powers. The game might have \"forgotten\" to tell you that until the third level... whoops. Yes, all this game teaches you are the basics. There isn't much hand-holding, and you will likely get the bad ending on your first playthrough. However, you will get a chance to fix that, starting from the beginning of the final level.
