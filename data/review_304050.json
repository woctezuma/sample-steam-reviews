Trove has a vast style range consisting of different weapon styles, gear styles, and costumes for individual that are all customizable and can be combined with different styles to make your hero unique to you. The gameplay is a very unique experience since it rely's on player based movement and stats. There's different hero's that you can use, with some ranging to all damage, or even all health to conquer all worlds and bosses, while still upgrading your characters abilities to make them even stronger than they are now. \n\nWhile this game is very fast paced, it has it's slow times as well. Grinding for the items can be very time consuming and seem to have no end. The server's connection to your platform is very poor, as you \" rubberband \" a lot.

I would log in with one of my best friends and play, level, and build. Classes cost in game currency, so it only took around ~2 months for me of playing an hour a day to obtain every single class. Leveling was not difficult, mounts were not hard to get, and reaching max level was only a matter of time and not that far from people who spent money on this game. Market was somewhat balanced, item mall did not give too many OP items, and it was possible to see people reach max level without spending a single cent. Streamers were nice, loved the game(I was part of a streamer's guild and watched 20+ hours of his stream), and had massive giveaways that simply made every minute of this game fun to play. Grinding was not that annoying since drop rates were not unreasonable, and crafting materials were not so difficult to find or buy from others. When I would happen to get bored(very rarely), it would be a 'why not' to just go ahead and play some soccer from a stadium one of the guild members created. Toxicity and scammers were uncommon, since many people were flourishing and being quite successful both economically and emotionally. I was mastery 60/100 at that time after only about ~150 hours(before steam release obviously).\n[h1]After Steam Release:[/h1]\nTrove created a \"Patron Pass\", basically a premium subscription based system that when activated, gave double drop rate, double exp, and multiple other benefits. This seemed miniscule at first, since not only was this given out two weeks for free, the buffs do not look that overpowered at first. However, at a deeper glance, trove seemed to slowly lower drop rates for rare items, and people would have to rely on Patron benefits to simply live like the old life of the f2p player BEFORE the steam release. However, this by itself was not bad, since trove gained more populrity, Trion struggeld to keep servers up. Level cap increased to 200. I only pushed myself for another 40-50 hours to make myself readch around level 90/200. Many systems were added to late game characters that seemed to break the economy, as late game players were the ones with 99% of the money. Imagine the game's economy going into a elitist form of economy, that's how it became. Materials became 20x more expensive(Going from 1 flux to 20) and some items were downright impossible to afford. I realized even though I spend more than 150 hours on this game before steam release, I was no poorer than a brand new player who spent 10 hours after steam realease.\n[h1]After the \"Cancer Patch\":[/h1]\nThis. This is the patch that ruined the game. Trion made it so classes could no longer be purchased with in game currency.  Trion claimed that this was to increase the variety among the classes and make people feel more individualized. However, nothing was actually done TO the classes to make them feel more different. In fact, besides a few unnoticable buffs/nerfs, classes remained virtually the same, so Trion failed to communicate that to the people. Although I had every single class(they released a class later that I obviously cannot get without giving them my cash), it seemed like a horrendously stupid move as more people started to actually play this game. \nThe classes problem was only the beginning. They added flying mounts later(Dragons). At first this sounds like an amazing idea, as these flying mounts were faster than wings. However, you'd have to do daily quests every day for around a month to obtain one. That system was cancer, since logging in every day to do the same thing just to log out was monotonous and boring, Trion decided to scrap that system too. Since players were actually obtaining these mounts(How horrible right? /s), Trion decided to nerf this system and make a convoluted system where getting these dragons was near impossible and you would literally have to spend x3 the time getting these materials(since they divided the item into a 3 part item that needed to be crafted, hence x3 the time), getting these mounts was a fruitless endeavor.\nAs stated before, the economy was in ruin, so there was no way to be able to recover without buying items to sell in the item mall, or buying mounts directly that increased your level. I gave up at level 100/300, dirt broke even after grinding in the beta and doing 50 hours of grinding after steam release. Streamers have quit, even the streamer's guild I mentioned before had dissipated(LegendaryStudios). All my friends quit and think of this only as a 'meme game'. After Trion added more and more to the item mall that made this game completely pay2win, this game became a generic f2p that lost all originality that this game once was.  This game had a lot of history with me, and now that simply is just a memory.\n\nBeta:\n9/10\nSteam Release:\n5/10\n\"Cancer\" Patch:\n1/10\n\nEDIT1:I have recently read other reviews and I have noticed a common pattern. Devs seem to ignore and lock threads that have expressed concerns for the huge amount of bugs(since I did not mention these in my original review), huge gameplay downsides, and obvious player distaste for the cancer patch. When the players showed their absolute animosity towards changing a major system in the game(such as the classes costing real money), Trion did NOTHING to calm down the players or change this horrible system.\n\nEDIT2:I never knew this review would actually gain a lot of support from the steam community, so thanks for the support.

I will state why, but we will go with the positives before the negatives.\n\n\n[b] - Positives - [/b]\n\nThis game is great because of the community. I love this community as everyone I met were nice and helpful. I used to be with many great clubs. Whenever I have a question, I ask them and normally someone responds almost immediately (if and only if they are online at the time). Clubs are very nice to meet new players. I became an officer in a few clubs for being an awesome player and being very helpful.\n\nEverything you do in this game makes you feel rewarded somehow; like earning a new dragon, or earning your new favorite skin. It can be anything. For example, you can spend a good amount of time (it can be frustrating at times) to earn a dragon, but once you finally got that. You are finally done. You completed an achievement. Hurray!\n\n\n[b] - Negatives - [/b]\n\nI have lost faith in Trion Worlds with their poor handle of the game. Slow on everything, banning players for doing something completely legit (fishing while watching a Netflix movie; yes this is bannable folks if you don't respond to a GM), always buggy or broken, poor performance and optimization, and more. I can name many.\n\nI will talk about the major downfall of this game. Progression. It's HORRIBLE. When I mean horrible, it is really, really bad. It is VERY hard to progress at early stages, especially for new players. Reason? It's due to RNG. Majority of your power rank comes from gems. You have to spend countless hours just to farm a decent gem. It can be an ENTIRE MONTH just to get a perfect gem. Also, when you are upgrading your gems, you have to play another RNG of getting perfect rolls. Literally, everything in this game is RNG. I can name many; dragon fragments from certain tasks, opening caches for something good, what I said before with upgrading and decent gem drop, and more.\n\nWhen something breaks in this game, it takes Trion ages to fix the issue. For example, a few bugs were in the game for almost an entire year where they finally fixed it. Really? It's been around that long and they finally fixed it? Like come on. They really priortize content over bug fixes. Like, 99% content, 1% bug fixing. They may have changed since then, but that's how it was back then.\n\nMy biggest pet peeve in this game is where Trion milk players for their money. Literally a lot of 'mastery points' comes from with real money. Also, this game is heavily p2w.. You need to play a lot of money in order to progress.\n\n[b] - Conclusion - [/b]\n\nWhat should I say about this game? I don't recommend this game to anyone anymore as the game attention span is around 2 weeks. A player will pick it up, play it, then quit. This game has really no way of keep the new players in. The community is very nice, but Trion Worlds is an awful company to deal with. I'm not going to stop people from playing this game, but it is their choice. They can try it. If they like it, nice; and if they don't, oh well.\n\nTrove could have been better if it wasn't for Trion Worlds with their lazy ways. They chose to let this game die, losing many of their veteran players.\n\nAgain, I would not recommend Trove to anyone. It's best to pick up another game and play that game instead.", "timestamp_created": 1521956367, "timestamp_updated": 1522064390, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 367, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.923230409622192383", "comment_count": 26, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47293820": {"recommendationid": "47293820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070842180", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 38747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 987, "last_played": 1551839162}, "language": "english", "review": "So... Trove...\n\nMy friend, many years ago got me into this game and I loved it! The game is simple to pick up and understand, It's full of baddies to slay and dungeons to plunder, and on top of that it's got a wide selection of interesting characters, all of which with different playstyles. And, in my opinion, the artstyle is really nice; Everything in the game is made of voxels, from the buildings to the characters to the weapons and mounts, and while it looks kinda odd in some ways, it's got charm.\n\nBut as much as I love the game, it's world and characters, I simply cannot reccomend it.\n\nI hear many talk about p2w aspects of the game, and at first I never saw it but it's become much more prominent. And to make matters worse, progression in this game later on requires countless of hours of  g r i n d; levelling a character from level 0 to 10 is nothing and will take maybe an hour tops. Levels 10 to 20 will take maybe a day or two.... and from 20 to 30... Well, for me anyway, it took a few months....\n\nAnd that's JUST for levelling the character themselves, and not acquiring better gear or gems; Both gear and gems can be levelled and that will ALSO take a long, drawn-out grind, and for gems specifcally it involves RNG.\n\nBut what about if you don't care about grinding? What if grinding never bothered you to begin with? Well, unfortunately Trove has issues beyond that, and that's in the gameplay itself. To make it brief, the gameplay is very simple and easy to pick up, but it lacks any real depth after that; Every character, while different visually, can end up doing the same 1-2 combo of attacks and abilities; For example the Knight class, a melee-user, you might hold down left click and press right click occasionally, and the same exact strategy can work for, say, the Dracolyte class, whom is a magic-user.\n\nAnd even if you can look past all of that, much like I could, the final nail in the coffin was simply how broken the game was. This game featured some of the WORST rubberbanding latency I had ever seen, and it made some characters, like the Chloromancer, Gunslinger, and especially the Boomeranger literally unplayable due to how their kit worked. And even if you weren't playing those, it would screw over anybody playing anyone, either because the game forced you to miss a jump, or forced you to miss a dodge. I've heard it's since been fixed but frankly I don't believe that because they've said that before and it wasn't fixed.\n\nIn short, I'd like to reccomend Trove for it's simple design, fun characters, and enjoyable artstyle, but too many gameplay and technical hiccups make the game too much of an unenjoyable slog to bother.

And occasionally it sucks me back in. But even with closing on 700 hours of gameplay, I would not recommend this game to anybody [b]in its current state[/b].\n\nFact: Trove is a grind-centric game, and always has been. Progression comes from two primary sources:\n[list]\n[*]Collecting weapon/armor/mount skins, allies and more, which all progress the \"mastery\" system, granting rewards and account strength\n[*]Levelling and gearing your class(es)\n[/list]\nThis would not be so bad if not for the fact that experience is throttled to incentivize buying a \"subscription\" in the form of \"patron status\", which effectively doubles progression rate. Then, in terms of mastery, you regularly receive premium lootboxes called \"chaos chests\" as dropped loot, however recent changes have account bound them and their contents, when their contents amount to more than a common crafting material.\n\nWhen I started playing, monetization was relatively minimal. Patron always existed, but there were many players buying tradeable passes, driving the player economy. Most of the rewards and currencies could be traded, and the dev lead stated that monetization would not be a focus in the game. This has changed, rather rapidly, over the past year or so as more and more items are being locked to accounts, while cash shop equivalents in the form of loot boxes have popped up. Formerly fair sales have been replaced with a \"loyalty currency\" that pales in comparison. Tradeable premium currency and Patron Pass options have dwindled to incentivize personal purchase, killing the game economy. Double Experience Potions were added to \"weekly sales\", and experience gain silently decreased. And yet in spite of all of these revenue sources the servers function as bad (if not worse) today as they did before the monetization upscale, and content improvements are so infrequent that it's easy to believe the game has been abandoned only to suddenly see a news article about a major update some six months to a year later, with enough content to keep you busy for about two days.\n\nTo put it bluntly, the developers became greedy. I don't know if this is due to pressure from Trion Worlds (who do not have the best monetization track record) or the development team just fell to the dark side. Either way, I strongly recommend looking to other F2P games to waste your time. Warframe, Path of Exile, and Guild Wars 2 (not on Steam) are all highly recommended and survive and grow on completely non-abusive F2P models and are far more deserving of your time and attention than what Trove has become.\n\nShould things change and the development of this game shifts to stop trying to milk every cent out of its users, I'll happily change this review. I fully understand that they the game has to remain profitable to remain alive, but there's a fine line between being profit-viable and consumer-abusive, and Trove sadly crossed that line a long time ago.", "timestamp_created": 1513831076, "timestamp_updated": 1513869524, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 163, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.879297852516174316", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36649730": {"recommendationid": "36649730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031899688", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 141486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512221186}, "language": "english", "review": "As you can tell from my hours played, I have enjoyed SOME of my time in trove. I've never had a lot of fun on mmo's as they seemed to lack a certain something be it story, or imaginative quests, overly repetitive missions. Trove fails in all of these aspects, but the unique ability to build/destroy in the over worlds and club worlds and the creativity shown on the part of the designers always something that kept me around and playing. Recently however the developers have seemingly stopped caring about the game. The recent patches have added content that can only be described as pay-to-win. The three largest problems are: their introduction of the gem system, their completely lackluster server performance, and their almost hostile refusal to accept criticism.\n\nIt first started with the introduction of the gem system. In which you must grind for gems to equip to a character. Finding a decent gem to equip can take upwards of 3 hours of constant grinding or longer depending on your luck, as each gem is given by a randomized loot box that is in itself is a random drop from dungeons. Each character can hold up to a maximum of 9 gems. Then these gems must be leveled which takes gem fragments that are given for destroying unwanted gems. The leveling gems again introduces an RNG system in which you can pay in-game currency and dust to have a random chance at leveling up the gem or possibly breaking the gem, which in turn then takes a separate time-gated currency to repair. As an added bonus, you cannot remove these gems from characters once socketed unless of course you pay the time-gated currency to unsocket them. Overall your looking at hundreds of hours of grinding and months of waiting for the time-gated currency to fully level one characters gems. Not to mention that recent patches have added mounts that grant stats increases to all of your character that can take, literally over 600 HOURS of grinding to unlock, or, of course, you can buy loot boxes with cash for an extremely low chance at one of them. \n\nThe other problem is their servers. Upon opening this game you can tell within minutes that they do not have the capability to run this large of an mmo. Lag is a constant concern in the game, so much so that certain characters whose abilities are based on skill-shots/ fast fire rates are near unplayable at times because of the inability to hit the enemy from server lag. The developers are well aware of this problem so much so that they seemingly have started to develop around these issues. In game you are capable of using potions to restore health, however, due to unbelievable server lag the chances of you actually being capable of using a potion before you die is next to none. Therefore they have introduced a potion that auto-consumes on low health, of course they have also made this potion the most expensive one in the game by nearly doubling the price. The largest concern happened when they released their latest content patch during which they have stated they are being DDoS attacked. They servers have been disconnecting everyone every 20 minutes for the past 6 DAYS. Now during this event the developers commented that this attack was not directed at them and would be fixed soon. All of which is seems massively unbelievable as if they were not the target its amazing that it coincided with their latest patch, and if it is a DDoS attack, this is an exceptionally long one, during which they have done nothing to try to circumvent the issue. \n\nThis brings me to their inability to take any criticism at all. As you can imagine a lot of the long term community is aggravated about the recent patches that introduced time-gating, overly excessive RNG, poor server performance, etc. However if you look at their official forums they seem to have only overly positive responses and forum posts. This obviously is because they ban anyone who makes any sort of criticism to the games current problems. Recently I was banned for posting this response to their DDoS attack post https://i.imgur.com/bynGOFk.jpg for \u201ctrolling other players\u201d. \n\nTLDR: The game is rife with RNG, loot boxes, and uncaring developers. Which is a shame because there is an absolutely amazing MMO with real creativity under the layer of all of this crap that has recently been added. Shame, but I think I'm finally done with this game. \nPS. I would love a developer to comment the state of their servers since apparently asking a developer to on their forums is ban-worthy.

It had amazing dungeon-based raids, a completely player-based market, and an amazing community as a whole. The game would range in from playing the game, getting high amounts of loot, transferring that loot into materials, to upgrade your current gear. You would then need a way to make the in-game currency, called Flux. I remember several different ways, like recipe farming, or fishing for glim, another currency, and using that glim to purchase pets to sell for Flux.\n\nNow mind you, I probably have rose-colored glasses on since I played it so long ago, but I'm fairly certain it was a strong game, based purely on the fact that it was run by the players for the players, yet you had the option of purchasing characters from the actual ingame store, or the costumes. Even then, you could buy cosmetics from the player-market.\n\nHowever, this all changed when the company got a little too fucking greedy with their policies.\n\nOriginally, there was a currency you would get for completing achievements and logging on - which you could use to purchase different types of potions, characters, or just generally any item that may not have been free without actual currency.\n\nThey swiped it away however for the sake of making more fucking money - which was excusable at first, but those less fortunate could not purchase the characters they wanted.\n\nNow, in the game, tier levels existed for gear. You had a base level, of I believe like 20, then you could raise that level with gear upgrades.\n\nIt only went over about 20 more levels, where it reached max.\n\nNow mind you, these tiers you couldn't just purchase, you had to actively grind and work for it, playing the market to your tune and manipulating it while farming and raiding in smart ways.\n\nIf you log on now, you can effectively get max rank with the use of money, and everyone else that may have been equal, are now completely lower than you.\n\nThe game was always fairly grindy and, to a degree, boring. (if played for an unholy amount of hours)\n\nThe reward, was popping off in the same tier you were stuck in, and oneshotting everything.\n\nBut now, they have completely said fuck all to that system, and just said, \"Hey, if you can get mommies credit card, then you can get max leveled gear and completely fucking dominate without any actual work.\"\n\nIt was a fun game, but if you look at the DLC content for the game, you can just fucking see the cash grab potentional.\n\nThat's sadly the story.", "timestamp_created": 1542229406, "timestamp_updated": 1542229406, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 95, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.840915679931640625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "41783960": {"recommendationid": "41783960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172061581", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2021, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550421346}, "language": "english", "review": "Each new update just makes the game more pay to win.

If I'm brutally honest, I loaded this up expecting to play a very amateur-ish game with little amusement value. I was entirely wrong.\n\nTrove is, in many way, Minecraft with more RPG/MMO features put into it. The graphics are blocky and hugely varied, creating a really colourful and vibrant world. The sounds also fit the game style very well. A lot of the enemy voices are really quite funny, and difficult to decipher.\n\nThe building is somewhat basic, though there are a huge amount of blocks to be unlocked, some rarer than others. I find the way your own plot of land works interesting: there are plots all over the map, more are found in some biomes than others, and you can claim any of them as your own, where your house pops up. Any changes you make to this house stick with it. Then, you can just claim another spot, the other one disappears and your house has moved! It's quite cool, really, and stops the whole real estate issue a lot of games have (ArchAge).\n\nThere are currently 11 classes that all play very differently and have unique pros/cons. The combat is like that of an action RPG, with all abilities from enemies being dodgeable, if you have the reaction speed! The enemy AI is nothing particularly special, they essentially just run at you, but their attack patterns and visuals are different enough to keep you on your toes. \n\nI feel Trove is a bit all over the place with how in depth it wants to be with it's RPG elements. There are lots of stats on your equipment (including magic find, I like!), but very few equipment slots compared to other MMOs. The classes all have really different gameplay, rare for an MMO, but each class only has a basic attack and 3 abilities. It's a little odd, if I'm honest, as though the developers were told to reign it in. I can understand that, but I do wish there was more diversity in choosing your abilities, as it can grow a little stale.\n\nAt first, I thought this was a good first MMO, and I think I will get my 7 year old sister into this, I think she'll enjoy it; however, after level 10, some of the enemies are actually pretty damn difficult. Pre-10 the game is very easy and offers little in the way of challenge, but it soon ramps up. Younger people may actually struggle with this game, but I think a lot of them would enjoy the building aspect, as well as the combat side. \n\nTo sum up: this is a great little MMO with loads of interesting features and fun gameplay. It'd be great for a first time MMO and for children, but offers challenge after the intro (first 10 levels) to keep anyone interested. With friends, it's very enjoyable seeing who can make the funniest looking character. It can get a little grindy after a while, but I would still recommend giving it a go and deciding for yourself.\n\nEdit: I feel I should mention there are long queues. MMOs never keep up very well during the first few days of release, and this is no exception. Expect to be waiting in queues to play for a few days, unfortunately. Hopefully the servers will quieten down a bit in the next few days, or the developers will upgrade the servers to handle the load.\n\nAs of 13/07/2015, the queues are still quite long, they are apparently working on them all the time.

If you're not one of the VIP-lister big names, you might as well not exist. If you are one of them, prepare to have the game rebalanced around your experience and given lavish rewards constantly just for being teacher's pet. I'm not exaggerating on this one - they recently as of the time of writing (05/01/2016) introduced Contests, where whoever has the most score in X category gets some pretty good prizes at the end of the week. Sounds fun? Well too bad this dev team are like fun mosquitos, because they managed to royally heck it up - mastery is a static statistic that can only possibly go up and catalogues how much stuff you've collected in the game. So those who already have everything get even more stuff, and those who are starting out get the finger.\nOn that statement, i'm once again not exaggerating - one of the first weekly contests was akin to \"how many dungeons can you clear\". This resulted in hordes of high-end players descending upon the lowest level worlds like a plague of jackass locusts and cleared all the dungeons in a crazed gluttonous frenzy that'd make the zerg themselves soil their carapace. Why is this bad? Because the new players couldn't get any levelling up done because all the dungeons had been one-shot by the high end turd brigade.\n\nNow I know, you could put this one more on the community than the devs themselves. However, I don't believe for one second nobody internally didn't forsee this happening. Are you seriously going to tell me that a dev team which as far as i've seen consists of at least seven people (most likely quite a few more) didn't confer among themselves and think \"Hey, we should probably put some kind of limit on this!\"? What are they paying these nimrods in, pocket lint?\n\nYou may be noticing a trend here - that new players get the shaft a lot, and that I use the phrase \"i'm not exaggerating\" a lot. I'm having to throw in these disclaimers because as I type this myself there's still some itching, tickling feeling somewhere buried deep in my brain that tells me \"Come on, no one can possibly develop something this stupid.\". Oh they can. They can. Did I recall the nerfs to a whole bunch of stuff which has made the game harder than ever for new players to get into, at the profit of the highest-end dev suckup players? Let's list a few!\n\n- Classes, formerly available for an ingame currency you get a small daily stipend of, are now pay-only. You can get five or so for free by jumping through some various hoops, but once you've done that you have to open your wallet and bend over, or leave. This wouldn't be so bad if some classes weren't outright gimped, so it's entirely possible for a new player to make five crappy picks and then just be stuck.\n\n- Dragons, a form of personal progression that grant account-wide power, have been made harder and harder to get. Dragon coins, the ingame currency you need to unlock them, have been made untradeable so you've got to accumulate 300 per dragon all by your lonesome. How do you get them? Hourly challenges, where you've got 20 minutes to clear X amount of dungeons in a specific area... which you get bonuses for if you're in a high level world, and if you're using one of two classes randomly picked from all the currently existing classes. See how that's a problem when you're low level and don't have many classes unlocked? Well unlock all classes, and you ca- oh. Oh dear.\n\n- Content expansions. The new expansion Mantle of Power just came out as of the time of writing, and jesu cristo crocodrillo. I'll get to the myriad of inherent problems with that in a moment. How does it affect new players? It affects them negatively because a bunch of options have been \"re-balanced\" (read: nerfed into oblivion) around the new high-end content. The knock on effects of this on new players seem to have been totally ignored - the players who already have few options other than \"grind more\" and \"git gud\". Double damage emblems which grant you a buff that actually makes you able to kill stuff in a reasonable timeframe got nerfed twice - first the ingame currency cost was raised, and then it got reduced to lasting something like 3 seconds, down from around 7 or 8. Why? Well, because **** YOU, THAT'S WHY. BUY MORE OF OUR STUFF.\n\nThat's just three pointers. I could go on all day, which you're probably feeling like I have already at this point, though in all honesty spending an equal amount of time reading this or playing Trove seems like you'd feel more accomplished after reading this.\n\nNow as I said, the new expansion really shows off how creative the dev teams are. A lot of end game players were complaining that all they really had to do once they got there was grind grind grind. Don't worry, Avarem and his team have you covered! With the new themed elemental worlds to explore, you can do the following:\n- Grind the same dungeons as before BUT ON THE SEA!\n- Grind the same dungeons as before BUT IN LAVA!\n- Grind the same dungeons as before BUT IN THE SKY!\n- Fight a zerg rush of boss monsters for a randomized prize that you can only get out of a chest if you brought a key that you can only get randomly from a box that randomly drops, the prize being a gem that you need to level up BUT there's a random chance of failing to level up and smashing the gem into a million bits but don't worry there's an item in our cash shop that can repair the gem and then you can break it again because you had the audacity to try and make progress but don't worry, BEND OVER PEASANT, IT'S WALLET TIME.\n\nThen, there's gems. Ohhhhh boy. Okay. This one's going to take a bit of explaining for the layman's benefit, but at this point you've already read the 500 meters, why not go for the reading marathon? Reading is good for you!\nSo pre-release in Trove the gear system was.. not great. Gear could only be improved so far, so it was possible to get a \"bad drop\" which would have terrible stats you don't want and you'd be stuck with it unless you want to go find some other thing. If it was a high level drop with bad stats? Too bad for you, grind more. This was rather unpopular and was eventually replaced with the current system where any piece of gear can be forged all the way up from the lowest to the highest quality and you could re-roll the random stats. Get a cool-looking sword with bad stats on it? No problem, just get some crafting materials to muck with it a bit until you've got the stats you want on it and you're good.\n\nNow gems, the new \"power yourself up\" thing comes out... and they run off the old gear system they scrapped that nobody liked.\nWhat.\nNot only that, but you can't see all the stats on them from the get-go. You have to upgrade them at a not-at-all cheap cost (which can fail and smash the gem as previously stated), at which point you can despair at your wizard being equipped with a physical damage gem ALL ALONG, that you need to pay to remove from the slot.\nDoublewhat.\nI despair to think anyone in the dev team thought they were being clever with this. Folks didn't like it once, they ain't gonna like it a second time with a bit of window dressing on it, genius!\n\nWow, i've actually hit the character limit on reviews. Weird.\nClosing word: I looked up the lead dev's development history. He has worked exclusively on flops, and it shows here. This game had potential, but not with this jerkoff leading the show. Burn the fields, salt the earth, start over - there's not going to be any good gaming to be found here until Trion does that.\n\nAlso note the dev response doesn't really address anything set forth here.

When the game first came out it was one of the most addictive games i had played in years; the dungeons were original and the amount of biomes was the perfect amount between overwhelming and bland. The amount of characters you can choose from are quite spectacular with it and offer a wide range of gameplay within it. This was my initial feeling of the game, but has changed in the past year or so.\n\nI will start off by saying that i do very much enjoy the game, and still continue to play it (100+ hours on steam as well as 400 hours on their own glyph launcher independant of steam), but with some of the things that happen in game makes me write a different review for it.\n\nIn the beginning of the game it was very easy to get started and straight forward, chat was calm, people were helpful (sometimes still are) and you could trade almost everything you had. Now, however, that is not the case; over the couple years (early to mid 2016 i believe) they released this update that adjusted the characters abilities, as in strengthening them and adding one of the most grindy things i have seen: gems. The game is very hard to start off as a beginner because it is so overwhelming to begin, everything is so confusing because the tutorial is still what it was in the early game (which means it misses a lot of content that is needed) and leveling up is the most painful thing to do then. You would really have to dedicate a ton of time to this game to actually get anywhere, because almost everything (75%) is based solely on RNG (Random Number Generation). This means that the chances of getting a GOOD gem for your character is quite low and will make you grind for tens of hundreds of hours just to get a few good gems (although just recently they are adding a feature to remove the bad stats on a gem). My girlfriend, one of my best friends, as well as me still continue to play this game is it gives us great enjoyment, but we are not able to help any of our friends because barely anything useful (aka gems) is able to be traded, so you could have an amazing gem for your friend, but you cant give it to them. in my personal opinion i would rate this game as a 7/10, but for the sake of beginning players and the challenges it brings, i would say this game is a 3/10.\n\nEDIT: My previous statement of actually enjoying this game has been retracted; this update that just came out has completely ruined any enjoyment i once had for this game. Trion is basically making the game feel like its only about making money and not about their fanbase. They completely disregard their fanbase in their PTR and went along with it. One of the new bosses in Shadow Tower (just below DotM) is utterly broken and would need nearly max PR in game to even beat it (whereas DotM is an easy sweep despite it being higher up). I can no longer appreciate this game because there is grinding four a milenia to get nothing good, and will take another to just beat this new boss. Any respect i once had for Trion industries is now gone and all my friends that played alongside with me also believe that Trion is so money hungry that they can't even see how much they have ruined this once fun game. Limitations on upgrades for gems is atrocious; these new gem upgrades are complete garbage even though it will cost you a ton of valuable resources. These upgrades are limited to a certain amount per week because it uses the loot from shadow towers which is stupid af. They overhyped the re-rolling feature for gems so much and they really dissapointed many people by having to spend a week's resources to make one or two. To explain how bad the ST is now, my friends and i were able to solo all the hard tower, whereas now the three of us can't even beat the bloody new boss on hard. These developers deserve every ounce of critizism that comes their way. \n\nIn Short if you didn't want to read my rant: dev's became too hungry for many and created a monster that requires you to pay or grind for years.", "timestamp_created": 1502505247, "timestamp_updated": 1503477964, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 184, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.860572159290313721", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17001824": {"recommendationid": "17001824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052314944", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 8747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1522509433}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game 8.5/10\n\nPros\n-Endless worlds and dungeons of various difficulties to explore\n-You start with a mount, and eventually get ships, wings, and mag carts later on\n-Can build your own POH and can deploy it wherever you go and see a hotspot\n-Tons of loot, which you can destroy to gain it's appearance and mastery points\n-Crafting system works well, later tiers will have you grinding a lot of mats though\n-Seemless class switching\n-Not P2W (everything can be bought with in game currency except for a few exlusives and cash shop cosmetics)\n-Very addictive\n-Admin team, keeps users updated frequently and in a timely manner, quickly responding to issues\n-Can instantly teleport to other players currently fighting, this includes people in your club and your friends\n-Loot is not shared, what you see drop is for you, hitting a monster at least once grants items/xp\n-If you are close enough ore mined is shared with everyone nearby\n\nCons\n-Can get repetitive, if u  play in large doses\n-Lacks viable trading platform, i.e. auction/trading system, but you can still trade person to person or at a trading post\n-Long que times, but be honest what MMO after launch doesn't have this issue with a sharp increase in user base\n-Minor bugs causing a disconnect and reconnect issues, rare and admins are aware of it\n-Class skills are limited", "timestamp_created": 1436661989, "timestamp_updated": 1436692511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 353, "votes_funny": 28, "weighted_vote_score": "0.903780460357666016", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40201925": {"recommendationid": "40201925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198232535724", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 82258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1542101463}, "language": "english", "review": "(Been playing since 12-22-2015 on Glyph. Switched to Steam in 2017 for mods)\n\nThis game has so much potential to be something else. I'm going to list a few flaws that keep this game from becoming a good MMO. I'm assuming you know atleast a bit of Trove before reading this, as I won't be explaining much. \n\n1. The servers are complete garbage. You can be standing by someone who has bad internet and be effected by their lag. You can be casually farming and rubberband 20 feet backwards. You can be playing a ranged character and be shooting a chest to open it, when you would beat the dungeon in a split second. Let me say that again - It takes longer to break a chest than to kill a boss. \n\n2. The time-gated content. I understand that this is a F2P game with it's buyable content, but you didn't even make all time-gated content available in the store. Make everything CREDIT (in-game currency that can be obtained by F2P and P2P) and not pure cash. This makes P2P players even more likely to buy credit pouches and sell them in the market for F2P. It's just good to be consistant, and as of now the store is not consistant in any perspective.\n\n3. Tradable items. I don't know why you're doing this. Tradable dragon coins, chaos chests (and all the loot in chaos chests) was fine to begin with. I'm not sure if you're aware but this is KILLING YOUR GAME. Stop making everything untradable. The droppable chaos chests were a good idea that I think should stay along side them being tradable. And no, the chaos crafter solution wasn't a good idea. If you kept chaos chests and all the loot tradable, people would just buy what they wanted from the market and wouldn't have to care about getting X amount of bones for that new mount. Just keep the new chaos cores and make chaos chests tradable again. Besides, why is there a system to replace tradable items in the first place? That's impressively stupid.\n\nBesides, this is an MMO. You interact with other players. So why are 90% of useful items untradable? \n\n4. There was no reason for you to remove the Pearl of Wisdom vendor. Because of that pearls are hard to find and their prices has jumped 10x the original price. Who thought that was a good idea? Pearls for 1k flux was perfect and no one found them to be a bother. This is not really a reason in itself, but an example of how clueless the devs are to situations like these. They've never responded to why they made this change, but alas it happend and ruined pearls for new players.\n\n5. There is next to none cooperation. As an MMO, you'd think there would be roles and DPS charts for us right? With people building their classes to be specifically for that? Well sorta... It's either tanking or damage. I guess you could say damage could be burst or DoT but that still doesn't change the point. Chloromancer was originally intended to be a healer, but I don't think the devs even understand how a support class would work. And because of that, Chloromancer is not a support and more DPS. It really does not matter what class you pick because in the end it's gonna be a Candy Barbarian pulling and a Gunslinger ulting that's gonna out DPS you by sometimes 10x. This leads on to my next point.\n\n6. The combat is terrible. I remember a developer for another game was talking about this. \"When a player finds out what's optimally the best option, they're going to abuse that option. Even if it's not fun for them.\" This is exactly Trove atm. As soon as you find out your optimal DPS output with your class you're not going to be using anything else unless you want to lose damage. A good example is the Shadow Hunter. As soon as you get your class gem all 3 of your abilities are practically useless now. Unless you want a short burst with your ult, in that case it's still a buggy ability and usually doesn't hit in the first place so you're better off using that 300% auto. Either that or for shooting through blocks with your ult or m2. In my opinion, abilities should not be situational gimmicks.\n\n7. The entire implementation of gems. So already doing dungeons is tiring and repeated throughout your entire playthrough and onwards. Just because the biome is different or the enemies shoot or punch doesn't make it fucking different. Oh wow i'm doing dungeons in the sky instead of the land thanks to elemental worlds. It's not diverse in any way and is mind numbing how RNG and time consuming the process is to find a good gem. \n\nAt the moment in end-game, you farm uber 9 for a time period, open your boxes, rely on RNG to give you a half decent gem, if not loot collect it and repeat. However, if it's a good gem upgrade it and equip right? Wrong. You have to check where the boosts went in your gem forge. Oh what's that? Three boosts into all 3 stats? Then I guess it's a trash gem so sell it and repeat.\n\nThat's not even scratching the surface of how badly made these little fuckers are. Not even mentioning gem augments. Ugh fucking augments dude. They're overpriced little shits that are the essence of endgame P2W. They even made achievements for fully augmenting your gems, as if they didn't know how fucking expensive it is. \n\nAnd empowred gem boxes are a fucking joke, let's be honest here. Wow I did Daughter of the Moon on ultra this week, opened 6 empowered gem boxes, got shitty radiants that find their way into the loot collecter in a matter of seconds, crafted a stellar empowered gem box and got shit again. Damn, guess i'll wait next week. OH WAIT! You can buy credits and get empowered gem boxes through that. And you can also buy gem booster boxes for credit! It's almost like they intended that, haha.\n\nIf the odd chance you get a stellar 3 star, you still can't be garenteed the ability you want which is 9 times out of 10, Pyrodisk, Cubic Curtain and Explosive Epilogue. Or  exclusively Stinging Curse if you're a Pirate Captian. (Which you shouldn't be playing anyways because Gunslinger does more damage right?)\n\nJust make sure when you're upgrading that stellar 3 star Pyrodisk gem that the boosts don't suck or else you'll have to find another! Yay!\n\nThey even made upgrading your gems P2W, grindy, luck-based and expensive! I don't understand how you can fuck up so hard and not realize.\n\nA clunky, poorly designed, luck-based, grindy and expensive system that is 3/4 of the player's power rank and usually all of their damage because of how crit damage and base damage scales together. Not to mention the crit hit aswell.\n\nEdit: Decided to edit this for a more recent review. With the geode update up on the rise you can clearly tell the developers have no fucking sense of direction to head this game. The mining fest that feels like a mobile game with it's timegates. I cannot believe this is the same game I once had fun playing. \n\nSo how can I summerize geode? Well, I bet you wont believe this - Grindy, repetitive, slow and p2w. An update that was supposed to be for the plot and preperation for Uber 10+? More like a mine fest that takes away all your movement options. \n\nWell atleast we know our augmented gems are safe from future updates after the question was asked for 2 months.\n\nConclusion: So ask yourself why every player who has hundreds of hours invested picks on this game? Probably because it sucks.\n\nI know i'm missing a lot of issues, but yet again this is just a small list. I don't like where this game is headed. The devs are working hard and doing great at the wrong things. I don't think anyone would give a shit about a new class if they just fixed most of the problems above. Again, they're great at their job but work on the wrong things. At the game's current state I advise you to play it to see how flawed it is, or ignore it.\n\nso anyways fuck trion and their tendency to ruin all their games.\n\nsorry about formating and grammar.

But after the new major update, the game is not exactly recommendable to new players.\n\npros\n-creativity - it's like minecraft but in the form of mmorpg\n\n-various options of costumes, mounts, weapon skins, wings, etc. It's fun to collect them, and it's the main reason why I play this game.\n\n\ncons\n-After the major update last year, the game changed a bit pay-to-win-like. Some 12 year olds say that this game became totally pay-to-win game, but not yet; you can upgrade your character as same as everyone else with same limit, but a bit slower than pay-to-play gamers.\n\n-Marketing sucks. Some people can see this as a minor issue, but the trailers the developers have been putting out are very straight-forwardly targeting 12 year olds, making this game seem immature for older/adult gamers. This adds to the bigger problem of making trove community a giant cancer. \n\n-Trove community is cancer. Bunch of 12 year olds spitting tumor everywhere in the chatroom. Clearly, devs don't care about harassment in online community. This is pretty sad because I see a lot of newbies hurt their feelings after 1 hour of gameplay and just quit. Bunch of immature kids don't even know how to properly talk and spit trash everywhere. And the funny thing is that they know their shitty place; when devs come to live chat with everyone, they extensively kiss devs' asses (yeah this is totally a Role Playing Game, role playing of douche and kissass).\n\n-And what's with this power rank showing. Everyone bullies another one and talks shit just because that player has lower power rank. I get it devs, I like the idea of power rank; it makes players thrive to achieve next rank. But do you have to show them publicly to everyone? Power rank is not a badge or title. PR doesn't show the gamer's achievement, but it shows players' value in the battle. IT SHOWS PLAYERS' VALUE INSTEAD OF WHAT THEY ACHIEVED. This power rank showing worsens this harassment and bullying. Apparently a number of youtube streamers talked about this and tried to notify devs, but devs clearly don't give a hot shit in other players' opinions.\n\n-------gameplay issue\n-excessive resource requirement for crafting after the major update. A mount's value (craftable mounts in advanced bench) increased from net value of about 35k flux to about 100k flux. This is one of the reason why ppl call this p2w game. 100k for a mount? This is insane for f2p gamers. Though understandable because mounts are just cosmetics, not really affecting the gameplay itself.\n\n-extreme lagging. My computer and wifi are way over-spec for this game, but it lags a lot. Devs need to improve the game server. Mobs don't get damaged, dungeon/achievement rewards vanishes, sudden teleportation to everywhere, and so on are all because of this laggy server. Even ps4 users are experiencing this problem, so this is seriously problematic.\n\n---------------\nIf one of the devs looks into this, I strongly suggest the devs to put \"report abuse\" button in Trove, just like any other mmo games, balance the crafting resources, do something about power rank bullying issue, and fix the general game server.\n\nAll in all, I strongly suggest new players to keep in mind that trove community is cancer, and you wouldn't achieve a lot if you are a free-to-play gamer. The game could be fun if you stay away from the majority of trash talking players, which is over 90% of the trovians, but it kinda defeats the purpose to play \"mmo game\" if you don't interact with another.\n", "timestamp_created": 1517028370, "timestamp_updated": 1517028370, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 155, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.817490994930267334", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21081978": {"recommendationid": "21081978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146792242", "num_games_owned": 682, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 109100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513772908}, "language": "english", "review": "Classes can no longer be purchased with Cubits.\n\nPS: Now China region dlc price none too \u6e05\u771f.\n\n\nOctober 3, 2016:\n\nClub officer can't use /zonerestrict command?  *a month after fix!", "timestamp_created": 1455041836, "timestamp_updated": 1478440350, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 325, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.826005756855010986", "comment_count": 51, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 0, "developer_response": "[url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/304050/discussions/0/412448792372692792/]Every class in Trove can be unlocked for free.[/url]\n\nAnyone who already had classes unlocked with Cubits will still have them.

It even crashes steam sometimes when it crashes and leaves the glyph launcher up. The servers are horrible (think \"rubberbanding\" constantly when there are more than a couple people near you). There are glitches that have been in the game for years that have not been fixed (I just reported one for candy barbarian involving its leap skill). Another glitch involves blocks called \"anti-gravity\". They are supposed to be impassible in the opposite direction of the block; however, it constantly glitches out and lets people through. There are plenty more but you can check the thousands of glitch reports to find those.\n\nThis degree of unplayability constitutes this game as BROKEN under the Steam ToS.

Now, this wouldn't be such an issue if the in-game store was sensible and the items in it would be worth the often insane price you are paying. The developers seem to be unaware of the value of the items as they keep pricing everything super high. For example: You can buy a dragons from the in-game store for \u00a338. Collecting dragons is a long-term goal and most players will be able to get a dragon a week pretty reliably. While the dragon they offer is without a doubt, one of the more time consuming dragons to get (As it is essentially locked behind a random event that takes place every hour), it is not impossible to obtain it normally as I have done it without much hassle. Sure, the pack with the dragon also offers some other goods, but in a game with so much content, those extra few caches you get are pretty much useless. I wonder what fantasy land the developers of the game are living in, where an item that is a little time-gated is worth the price of a nintendo switch game? Monitization is fine, but this is a straight up scam. Did I mention that there are 2 of these packs by the way?\n\nFor a development team that basically scams players out of their money, you would expect the game to at least run smoothly... but no! While I like the fact that the system requirements for the game are low, I am really bothered by several things: No. 1: The player gets disconnected from the game constantly, forcing the world to reload and just waste your time. This doesn't seem like a big problem, but it becomes much worse when it happens half the time you try to change worlds. No.2: Trove suffers from a major issue where after playing the game for more than 20 minutes, you will suffer major FPS drops, forcing you to relog. While this is only a minor inconvenience, it becomes really annoying once you have played the game long enough. No.3: Trove is plagued by insane rubberbanding. While the game runs fine most of the time, sometimes the rubberbanding becomes so bad that I cannot make progress at a resonable pace, forcing me to stop playing the game for a few hours in hopes of it getting better. Many might question my internet quality at this point, but rest assured I have monitored whether my internet could have been the culprit, and it most certainly wasn't.\n\nAll of this from a game which literally has an achievement (badge) for spending over $1000 on the game... gross...\nIn all honesty, I am very discouraged to continue playing the game as it appears that the game developers only care about getting payed, rather than caring about the players. For the record, I love the game and would love to play it more and spend time on it. I still have hope that Trove will one day have a bendela-christ/Paladins moment, where the monitization becomes smart and the developers learn to appreciate the player. As it stands now, I don't recommend the game to new players.", "timestamp_created": 1532531644, "timestamp_updated": 1532531644, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 70, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.780996322631835938", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23046353": {"recommendationid": "23046353", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973313040", "num_games_owned": 611, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442241188}, "language": "english", "review": "I would NOT recommend anybody to play Trove, I used to enjoy playing Trove every day for over a year (through the Glyph launcher which doesn't add hours to your Steam before you ask) but the game has become a cesspit ever since they made the game disgustingly pay to win out of greed.

While that's not necessarily a bad thing, grinding for gear, the problem I quickly discovered was that all gear could eventually end up identical, it was just a matter of, well grinding. I personally am not a fan of this design, because I enjoy the element of RNG that comes with defeating a boss and hoping to level you gear, only to realize the boss dropped someone so much better. There was also very little point to anything beyond the gear grind.\n[b][u]Recommendation:[/u][/b] If you love grinding, go for it. Don't get it if you're into Minecraft or other voxel-based construction games, that's not what this is about. It's also nothing like Cube World if you are looking for a time-filler until that game updates (ha good one). Trove is free, so theres no harm in checking it out, but do yourself a favor and resist the urge to buy the cosmetics and mounts and all that, the game is definitely not worth sinking money into.\n\n-----------------\n[h1]Key[/h1]\n\n[b][u]Review Style:[/u][/b]\n- Based on a simple concept: You are buying a game to get enjoyment out of it, so look at how much money you spent for the time that game gave you enjoyment, and decide if you feel it was worth it based on that along with you overall enjoyment with the game.\n\n[b][u]Future Hours:[/u][/b]\n[Unlikely] - I'm probably done with it.

My hours on steam speak for themself on how much time I put into this game. I was very sad when \"the straw that breaks the camels back\" finally landed on my back and I left the game for good.\n\nLike I said, I love this game. it can take a bit to get into, I had the luxury of starting with 1 character and no real options to do anything... it's come a long way and that's made it overwhelming. Something I've had several friends tell me when they tried to start playing it, so if you can stick it out, hopefully you find a fun game.\n\nSo why I wanted to write this review - as an early founder, founder package items were never realized, junk compensation was given, then years later something very similar gets released and the founds get nothing.  There were also a few packages that were supposed to get updates and backfill/grandfather the changes, it was like pulling teeth to get them to give those. It's like their records of ancient game data are just gone, if you have some thing from long ago, be glad, but I might not be a compatable package to get grandfathered changes from. So that\u2019s a real annoyance I had.\n\nWhat has made me stop playing is this: Early artifacts that have been removed from normal drop tables, still linger in the game. Example, workbenches from early alpha. These remained, useless but nice decorations for clubs etc. Remained movable for years, then last year, they coded them to poof, complete poof when moved...\n\nAnother thing they fail miserably at is detailing in game purchases. Example, they had a bundle that came with dragons, the pictures they showed were dragons, they have two types of dragon eggs in game, eggs that click and hatch and give you the dragon which are the premium eggs obviously) and then there are eggs that require you adventure and resource gather to hatch them. If you buy a premium bundle with real cash that uses verbiage to describe the bundle as get two dragons to adventure with, what egg do you expect them to give you the premium egg that gives you a dragon on the spot or the ones you have to go farm resources to unlock. If you said, on the spot, we are of the same expectation, sadly, it is the latter. Eventually they finally updated their bundle descriptions to reflect this but it was a month or two after it was released. To me, it felt very deceptive.\nI had a full wall of all the original benches and other decorations, I lasered them all down to move to new spot and found not a single one in my inventory... countless support emails, refusal to revert club or replace them. So as a long-time player, what they decided was to reward me with taking away things I worked hard in my early adventuring to make. It may seem trivial but I like to collect things and taking that away was unforgivable, because whats next, what thing gets removed with no warning. \n\nAnyways, that is why I don't play this game. If you are casual and just want something fun to play - go for it, give it a try. If you are a mmorpg player who kept your Tier 1 Molten Core armor set, might want to keep in mind discontinued models/blocks can go poof at their whim with no recourse for the player. The fact I stuck through all the other issues should speak volumes to the causal / fun play of this game before loosing my old artifacts.", "timestamp_created": 1523318133, "timestamp_updated": 1523653270, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.751646101474761963", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33571692": {"recommendationid": "33571692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012599344", "num_games_owned": 319, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 19234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1537825895}, "language": "english", "review": "Hi reader, I've invested a fair amount of time in this game and thought you might wish to know a little bit about this game before installing it onto your harddrive.\n\nEDIT:  Before you install, spend any time or money, here's a little tid bit I wish I had known before mindlessly clicking accept on the EULA. \n\n \"TRION MAY SUSPEND, MODIFY, TERMINATE OR DELETE ANY ACCOUNT AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU. Accounts terminated by Trion for any type of abuse, including without limitation a violation of these Terms of Use or a Game EULA, will not be reactivated for any reason. For purposes of explanation and not limitation, most account suspensions, terminations and/or deletions are the result of violations of this Terms of Use or any applicable Game EULA.\"\n\n-Keep in mind the above is for ANY REASON, if they don't like you or just decide to ban you out of the blue one day, they will.\n\n-The gameplay is fun in the beginning, you feel yourself progressing quickly and - with the new craftable classes, you can do even more for the mid-late game.  Collect a bit of gear here and there, but you'll quickly find yourself hitting a wall, the early game is...Well, short.  Around level 20 is where your mid game begins, from there you'll likely be grinding for your first Shadow V's or maybe even your first Radiant pieces and if you've been fortunate, you figured out the chat box can lead you to progressing just an inch further than you'd normally with a group of people your own level.\n\n-After level 20?  It's very, very grindy to get to level 30, which, a lot of people who have stuck around in this game probably really like the grind.  But even when you hit level 30, you'll still be grinding, for more gear, likely to try and get your first Stellars, probably around level 20-21 you'll have gotten your first empowered gem which you may or may not be able to equip depending on your level.  Along your way to 30, you'll be able to equip more gems - most of your power comes from gems, though a full set of Stellar gear gives a considerable amount that cannot be ignored as you gem up.\n\n-When RNG is good, it makes you feel fantastic, as opposed to the heavier side of the coin - the bad RNG, will make you want to rake your fingernails across a sidewalk, or any chalkboard you can find.\n\n-You can skip much of the grind by simply throwing extremely large sums of money into their store, which - if the game did have a price tag of say, 20$ - 40$, you'd make yourself blush by how much you could spend in one sitting, especially on their \"value packs\".  Some purchases will seem necessary as you reach the late game, especially if you want to have an easier time collecting the PERFECT gems for your slots once you've reached level 30.  You'll likely be very tempted to purchase tomes as well, when they're available as tomes give you a secondary reason to be out in the world grinding, as you grind, their XP bars fill up, once the bar fills out, it poops out whatever it says it'll give, into your inventory.\n\n-I myself was blushing as I spent a fair amount of cash during my own grind to try and get into what is essentially the late game.  Though even with what I'd spent, I found myself still needing to grind excessively, in this game.  You can effectively increase your luck through a stat that is known as \"MF\" or \"Magic Find\", the most common way to do this is by crafting sick ass dragon mounts that can lob bombs down onto blocks and fly.  Unfortunately for me, somewhere along the road my prepaid card I used for the shortcuts, must of had a hiccup and whatever money I did spent seems to have vaporized into nothing, moreso than just pixels on the screen - with that said, I did give the game a break only to come back seven months later, I was able to log in and play about two times, until finally a few days ago, I found myself banned.  I had no mail concerning the reason for my banning, nor did I have any spam mail.  It took two days for the first reply, bumping my ticket up because the guy who responded couldn't do anything I guess, then another two or so days pass and I get my most current reply, - as you know I mentioned a pre-paid card, seven months ago to now, apparently that card was the reason I got banned.  I hadn't been expecting anything to do with money when the good customer support stated the reason, I myself had thought I got banned because after I linked Steam and Glyph together for easier login, I tried launching the game through the folder it was installed in, instead of through steam, on admin (there was a problem with the auth server, it was likely my firewall blocking trove for whatever reason) and that'd been when the first error of being banned appeared (it only happened then).\n\n-SO...I'm still unsure if my banning had anything to do with money, why hadn't I been banned seven months ago (or the few days I logged in recently?).  I've got a strong suspicion that it had something to do with trying to log in through the folder (technical support said to try and set the Glyphdownloader to run as admin but there was no option for that.)...With that said, it could very well have been a very, very delayed issue with a prepaid debit card.\n\n-Still unsure of what exactly got me banned as they will not tell me, me but I got the end result regardless, perma ban, not a temp ban.  Please keep in mind that I did nothing wrong in game at all during my time of play and whatever financial aspects of a pre-paid card were completely out of my hands.", "timestamp_created": 1500159184, "timestamp_updated": 1500478533, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765279471874237061", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45116390": {"recommendationid": "45116390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198232387896", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 63824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1375, "last_played": 1551816340}, "language": "english", "review": "Used to be a fun game but nowadays its just a boring grind which has no variaty and just sucks the life source out of your soul.", "timestamp_created": 1538740932, "timestamp_updated": 1538740932, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.682637512683868408", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45520241": {"recommendationid": "45520241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255332904", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 52326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1535718993}, "language": "english", "review": "Player this game for have 1 year and i remember it being such an addictive game, everything was achieveable and me and one of my friend were at similar levels except i was just a tiny bit better.

I remember first playing it over six months ago, chosing the Ice Sage. I started it out with my friend, learning the mechanics and the controls of the game. I loved running through huge dungeons with my friend and loving it so much. It was actually a challenge; it took time and precision as I was a lower level. There was actual strategy; I'd use my 'Big Freeze' ability, while my friend would lash the enemy with fire and I'd throw icicles onto him. It was fun!\n\nI then found out the Ice Sage apparently 'wasn't great' in solo play, so I decided to start using the Lunar Lancer. It was fun. I levelled up more, hitting level 30 and trying to get the best gems possible.\n\nAnd now I'm sitting here with over 15000 power rank and I've realised that I've just had enough, and here is why.\n\nTrove has, as most people know, become incredibly Pay-To-Win, making it very difficult for new players to get a good start. Making progression without things such as patron can be very difficult and easily causes lower levelled players to lose interest. Trion favours higher levelled players (a dying few) and endgame players more than the new ones, rewarding them for being a higher level with things such as contests that are only possible to get something decent from with a higher level, or higher mastery. \n\nThe item system is quite boring as well. Most classes need just damage, energy regeneration/attack speed, and some critical damage and critical hit. There isn't a fun system where you could spend hours coming up with the best build for your class to make it personalised and more fun. The weapons are mediocre as well, not giving any cool abilites or buffs/debuffs that could be used to the players advantage. This makes the game more redundant and repetitive.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the gem system. This is possibly one of the worst parts of Trove; it's based completely around Random Number Generation and luck, not skill or level or time. I've played for six months and only ever gotten one perfect Empowered gem. I've also farmed over 1000 stellar gem boxes and gotten one perfect power rank gem, but with health regeneration. This is because it is based around luck, not time or skill put into the game. \n\nI realised this only recently, but I've had enough of a game where RNG is the only way to succeed; not time played, not level, not effort, just luck. And this completely ruins the game. Trove has so much potential; the devs could add incredible updates improving the gem system, making the more farmable, improving the weapon system to make it a little bit more interesting, and fixing all of the things that are broken about the game, such as ridiculous store prices, stupid updates preventing different things being done and removing important things from the game. Instead, they're spending weeks on end just to add a minigame that is broken and doesn't even work properly.\n\nI've just had enough of it. Sure, I might play to build things in my club and to spend some time messing around, but I've completely given up on everything else.\n\nIf you're looking to play this game because you want to play an MMORPG, I'd recommend playing another game. Sure, it can be fun at first but in reality it's almost wasted. I can suggest some other really good RPG's, such as the Borderlands Franchise or Terraria. But if you really want something this grindy and this repetitive, go ahead an play it.\n\nGood job Trion, looks like you're planning to ArcheAge everything.\n\nAnyway, if you got to the end of this review, good job.

Without being too long-winded, the game simply changed into something that is no longer fun for me.  How you acquire dragons with hourly challenges, the new gem system, and the focus on Patron (subscription status) really turned a fun and casual free-to-play game into a chore where you have to spend money to make meaningful progression.  \n\nAt first glance, the Mastery system is nice but after some time it becomes very evident that grinding purchases, with real money and in-game, just to get a higher Power Rank and Mastery level is too tedious for me.  The expansion added new levels to each class and in most games that\u2019s nice.  In Trove, it feels like work now.  Leveling is slow and somehow more repetitive from 20-30 on one class than the 1-20 I\u2019ve completed on eight other classes.  Not to mention, you can only buy classes with real money now.  Class leveling is a major way to increase Mastery rank and thus power.  Not being able to buy them with Cubits is a huge disappointment.  \n\nBasically, Trove became more effort than it was worth to me and with that I cannot recommend it.  With so many free and paid titles with more variety, better progression, and solid gameplay it seems like there\u2019s just not room for a game were you have to grind for everything.

Seriously, it's downright mind boggling how much the playerbase has generated at no cost to the developers.\n[*] Without paying, you can make or join Club Worlds, which are basically Minecraft-esque zones where the player can build (solo or with friends) whatever they want in their own instance, be it farming space (like, to grow crops), a football stadium to play with friends, or a giant roller coaster, only limited by your imagination.\n[*] Cornerstones are great, in that the player can have a portable house that they can throw anywhere out in the hostile adventure zones, as a \"home away from home\".\n[/list]\n\nIn my opinion, Trove has some drawbacks, but is an overall enjoyable game that I would recommend to anybody that wants to try something new, and enjoys both Minecraft and the Diablo series.", "timestamp_created": 1437940791, "timestamp_updated": 1438543121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.828937113285064697", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26094686": {"recommendationid": "26094686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148113083", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 13004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497375760}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah my hours is  bit weird.

Which isn't really a surprise to anyone that's ever played a game like Warframe. \n\nOr Trove. \n\nI'll start with the pluses, since I should at least try to be fair. Trove devs correctly understood that the most entertaining thing about Minecraft is starting a new world fresh and then running wild all over it, and made this a core part of the Trove experience. You select the difficulty of the world you want to enter, jump in, and enter a randomly generated instance map full of dungeons to pillage and bosses to kill. When you want to do it again, you just return to the hub and repeat the process with a new instance map. And unlike Minecraft, which can sometimes feel quite empty and desolate, you share instances with other players, and dungeons and other structures are common, which makes the worlds feel more robust and alive.\n\nYou also are not gimped as far as movement is concerned. Very quickly, you will earn the ability to jump three, five, twelve, twenty times in a row, giving you a lot of height and control in the air. There are also wings that can be used to glide very long distances, as well as flying mounts. \n\nThe Trove devs also understand that most people who like building simulators enjoy decorating. Trove has a vast list of decorative objects to build with, and most of them need to be unlocked by exploring and raiding dungeons, which is a great incentive to seek out specific biomes and pillage them for the biome-specific crafting recipies.\n\nIf only they could have stuck with their basic idea, this game would have been one of the best Free To Plays out there. \n\nBut they did not.\n\nFor starters, the servers are awful. And I mean bad. Really, really bad. No matter how good your rig is, no matter what company provides your internet service, regardless of whether you have a supercomputer or a toaster, or where you happen to live on Planet Earth, Trove will lag. And crash. And lag some more. You will get kicked from the game. Your game will crash, repeatedly. There is nothing you can do about it. It doesn't matter how solid your connection is, or how good of a machine you have. You could be using fiber optics in Europe, or running a toaster in Australia. You will experience regular, common blowouts, and that's all there is to it.\n\nSecondly, the game has gone hard, HARD pay-to-win. The main advertising point of the game, besides being a better and free version of Minecraft, was the classes, of which there are many. And surprisingly, most of them are pretty good. What a pity you will never unlock any of them. In the original iteration of the game, back in ye olden times, classes could be obtained one of two ways: you could buy them for a large amount of in-game currency, or you could unlock them with a Class Token. Class Tokens are items that are occasionally given away during events and streams, and can be purchased for the premium cash currency at the in-game store. \n\nYou can probably see this coming from a mile away, but guess what? After about a year of running the game this way, they nixed the ability to buy the classes with in-game currency. Classes can now only be obtained through direct purchase with money, or indirect purchase through a Class Token, itself an item that must be bought with real money.\n\nThis change is a slap in the face to the player base. Not all classes are created equal. Some are absolutely more powerful than others, and you NEED better classes to seriously attempt the highest levels of play. What's more, there is already a system of leveling, called Mastery, that gives you rewards at certain tiers of player level. It would have been child's play to simply grant players Class Tokens at regular Mastery intervals during their progression, or to even award the player a Class Token every time they max out the Class Level of a Class they have already unlocked. At least then you could earn the ability to get more classes by progressing and playing the game. People who were impatient or more casual could pay for their tokens, while the more dedicated players earned them.\n\nBut no. Trion decided to double-down on their greed, and the game suffers greatly for it. This one single change took a fun but unstable game, and turned it into a Skinner's Box of sadness and regret. \n\nThe third problem pales in comparison to the second, but it still needs to be said: your cornerstone, which is to say, the area you have to build on that is persistant and can be summoned to your location out in the field during instances, is not nearly large enough. The reason everyone makes their base a giant tower exactly as wide as the size of the cornerstone itself, is because it's the only real way to get anything done. Even though the variety of decorations avaliable is fantastic, the fact that you are gimped so hard when it comes to showing them off and putting together a persistant base makes the whole endeavor seem kind of pointless. After all, if it doesn't look good in a needle tower of stone or glass, then it isn't going to see much use. The idea of mobile bases in a free-range Minecraft MMO was a fantastic idea, but in the end, it falls flat, because you get a 20 x 20 space to do it in. No castle, mansion, or giant treehouse for you. \n\nAt the end of the day, I can't recommend Trove. This game is not what it used to be, and the only reason the User Reviews are \"Mostly Good\" is because we all (rightfully) adored it when it first came out. \n\nBut Trion has destroyed what used to be good in this game, and it is now nothing more than elaborate trap designed to guilt you into paying for dozens of cash shop items through false emotional investment. \n\nThere is a great, worthwhile game to be found in the endless-instance mobile-base freeform-MMO Minecraft formula.

Meaningful content defined as adventure world updates (combat, quests and dungeons), crafting, and building.\n\n[MONEY]\nI also fear that any game that you can spend hundreds ($300+ personally) on isn't enough to get everything. While somehow the devs claim that there isn't any incentive to develop and update a system unless a price tag is directly on that feature.\n\nBut Trove does have incentive to update content and classes. That's what everything else in the cash shop was for. The devs clearly don't understand that though.\n\n[CLASS COST CHANGE]\nClasses didn't need to be pay for only. There was plenty in the store and $20 packs people were buying including myself to keep the game going strong. And those packs are filled with items players made giving devs the free time to make content. The devs didn't even hold up their end.\n\n[FORCED GAME PLAY]\nAnother problem is that Mantle of Power essentially divides the community. Not because of power or even RNG, but because of Shadow Tower itself. We thought Shadow Tower was going to do that before until the community found out how to avoid it entirely since it had nothing to do with the adventure world. But MoP was designed to force it to be an integral part of the game to advance. Its promises of adding more abilities and content is just a cosmetic paint job for both with no real substance.\n\nWe waited a year for the same worlds only with gaps in between dungeons and a gear RNG that makes no sense but to put lucky/rich players in a different league from everyone else.\n\n[SAYING ONE THING, DOING THE OPPOSITE]\nThis leads to the biggest problems which is the devs' two-faced policy. That may be a cruel thing to say but it is an honest criticism that the devs must face. \"We don't want too much RNG into the game.\" Gems. \"We want to feel like players are progressing.\" Nerf then add new stuff to farm to regain that lost power. Actions entirely money driven. Ever since the game went live the team has done an about-face to meaningful content production.\n\nIt has stopped growing and instead added money dependent systems without doing anything substantial as thanks. Remember the content added thanks to dragon caches in the shop? What about making classes credit only? MoP is a result of that, asking you to spend more money not for cosmetics but for numbers that mean nothing.\n\nThey didn't lose money because of these decisions, but because of the lack of decisions to advance adventure world and building content. The things this game was founded on.\n\n[LEFTOVER POPULATION DEPENDENCY]\nYou are losing players from such greedy decisions in every system you add to Trove. To think where we would be if the number of players that Live and Steam added to the game stayed. This would have come to be if the dev team kept their Alpha and Beta momentum and kept advancing the content rather than pack in cash grab only systems. You would have had a large enough population to keep your pockets full while providing more content that is fun to play and not grind intensive. Including new classes and more abilities to former ones.\n\n[RETURN TO A FORM OF RESPECT]\nDespite that gap that dropped your population to a petty fraction, you still have a chance to return to the team that your were in Beta. You have enough money systems to make this game last a lifetime, so cut out the gem RNG and stick back to making money on the $20 packs and cosmetics (that players are making for you) and focus on actual content from here on out. Content development that people were brought into the game for in the first place.\n\n\n[[TL ; DR]]\nThink about how big Trove was in its first Live month and why.

For a large part of the game, mining is entirely avoidable, except at higher levels where you need to craft entranes (called Adventure Portals) I do wish that there was a quicker method of mining, but i'm fine using the 'mining laser' or bombs to collect my shapestone.

This basiaclly turns this game's combat mechanics into kite-back-and-shoot if you're a dps glass cannon or stand-and-hit if you're a tank. In weekly bossfights called Shadow Tower (which is pretty much the end goal of this game) the combat boils down to 1 tank tanking the enemies + 7 dps shooting them from distance. There are times when dps players have to move a little and dodge stuff but the bulk of gameplay is just keep distance, throw your abilities and shoot. \n\nSince the combat mechanic is so simple and dependent solely on how much damage you do, the unique set of skills of each character is underappreciated. Like for instant there's a healing ability (Chronomancer) and AoE buff (Lunar Lancer ult) but honestly those are just gimics. On top of that there's very little you can do in terms of building your character, because it's either you go tank or dps (for most characters it's dps). There's no skill tree or anything like that that will allow you to further customize your character. The only detailed customizations you can do is cosmetics. \n\nSo what is left of Trove when the core mechanical gameplay offers no excitement and replayability? \n\nGrinding.\nOnce you've cleared your weekly Shadow Towers, what you can do is either (1) repeat Shadow Tower but without the weekly rewards, (2) grind regular dungeons to loot gem dusts (and other materials) which you use to upgrade your gears or (3) do event-specific missions to grind crafting materials for event-specific cosmetics. \n\nRegardless of whether you care about cosmetics or not, you'll have to grind. I don't take grinding itself as a problem, but the problem is that these grindings are boring as hell because of the mechanics I mentiond earlier. You just fly in to a dungeon, kite-and-shoot, get loot and repeat. \n\nAnd if that itself was not enough, you'll have to grind hours and hours of these boring dungeons just to reach your max character level and especially to obtain upgrading materials (gem dusts) to max out your gems, which is the bulk of where your combat stat comes from. Not only upgrading gems takes insane amount of gem dusts, it'll take quite the amount of time and luck to loot the right kind of gems that has the special ability and stats that you want. If you want to dramatically fasten the gem upgrading process, you would have to pay money to purchase sh!t ton of gem upgrading boosters, which allows you to prevent your gems from cracking during the process (if you upgrade gems without any boosters there's a chance it'll break and you'll have to repair it with a certain material) and also boost the gem level increase with the same amount of gem dust. Otherwise, maxing out a single gem (out of 9) will take you forever. \n\nOnce you've maxed out your gems and your gears (which will take at least take a year if you play free), what's left to work on are crafting dragons (which offer minor combat stat) and cosmetics (wings, costumes, boat, pets, and mount). Crafting dragons require dragon coins (which is time gated so you'll have to wait) and other dragon-specific materials, which you need to do more dungeons to loot.\n\nMany of the free, craftable cosmetics requires time, luck and grinding. And what's annoying about these materials, including many of the dragon eggs and materials, is that they are obtained through RNG loots. So there's no gurantee that you'll get your desired amount of materials in an hour or in 2 weeks. \n\nSo what does a typical Trovian day look like? \n\nYou login once every day to get your daily rewards (which gets better as your overall stat gets higher) and log out.\nIf you haven't cleared your Shadow Towers yet then you look for a group or create your own in the ST chats, and clear through them. \nIf you haven't got enough materisl (keys) to obtain the Shadow Tower loots, you go grind regular dungeons to craft these keys, which will take around 30minutes. \nOnce you cleared the Shadow Towers you go back and use the rewards to upgrade your gears (by a bit) and if you feel like it you might go for some grinding. \nOtherwise you logout.\n\nOh I forgot to mention that this is what I'm like, and I'm pretty much close to the end game. So for an average player they'll require more grinding just to get their character level maxed, their gems maxed, their gears and rings maxed, to get enough materials to craft dragons, and to get mounts, costumes and other forms of cosmetics. There's a hell lot more of grinding than I do, and even if you bring your friends, it is just boring. \n", "timestamp_created": 1533315947, "timestamp_updated": 1533315947, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.700970113277435303", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38982870": {"recommendationid": "38982870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045427731", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 61833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1539986618}, "language": "english", "review": "I used to love this game, I really did.\nThen it became more pay to win than ever.

Have fun waiting 10x longer than before Feb 9th to get Flasks/Emblems. Don't like waiting? Spend another $100 unlocking them flasks/emblems. \n\nTrove: A microtransaction story. Everything is so overpriced that it is hard to justify spending anything on this game, let alone be forced to spend money in order to unlock classes (AKA the most important things in the game). Admittedly, i'd be very angry if I didn't already have the classes unlocked. \n\nThe dragons now can only be obtained by intense grinding because they now require 300 dragon coins which are no longer obtainable via trading. They drop \"commonly\" from the \"LESSER dragon chests\" (You can buy GREATER ones on the $ store), but COMMONLY is obviously RARELY because in the 30 i've opened, I have only had one dragon coin loot drop of 3. Oh, but if you don't like grinding.. spend $100 on the GOLDEN dragon egg, which instantly grants you the dragon!\n\nBefore Febuary 9th, the Microtransactions in this game were nothing but an ever present harmless nudge in your side. But after the 9th, the Microtransactions have become a violent shanking in your side with a rusty blade.\n\nStay away from this game until they get their heads out of our wallets.
