Chell must once again trek through many, and I mean many tests that are littered around the facility. This time she is accompanied with the Core, Wheatley, who is a nice fresh change to the original Portal where you're alone, except for GLaDOS, who is here once again to test and \"help\" you.\n\nFirstly, the gameplay. Portal 2 keeps many of the same physics and gameplay elements from the first game such as falling into portals to gain some speed or height, And the use of the Sentry Turrets. However, that doesn't mean new elements are added, such as new types of cubes and the 3 different types of Gels. Yes, there are three, not including the water. Each of the tests challenge you with puzzles galore and it is very satisfying to figure out a puzzle by yourself. The only times I had to look for a guide for assistance was during some of the non-test puzzles, like getting into the old test-chambers, or getting stuck in a room without the proper-test requirements.\n\nSecondly, the Story continues from Portal as you once again take control of Chell and complete the various tests that have been brought before you, in order to complete your goal of escaping the Aperture Facility. Its a nice story to buy upon on what the original Portal gave us. \n\nThirdly, as the time of this Review I haven't played the Co-op mode yet, however, I think its a very good idea as it is technically more fun to solve puzzles with a friend. Another thing is the inclusion of Steam Workshop support, which expands your testing chance greatly as you have a plentiful selection of test chambers.\n\nOverall, Portal 2 is the perfect sequel to Portal, its expanded on its portal based puzzles, added new elements to the puzzle process, and include a new Co-op mode. And Steam Workshop support is a great bonus to add to this game. The single-player mode took me around 5 hours to complete, which is a good chunk of game if you're only using the Single-player. Hopefully we'll get some more Portal goodness", "timestamp_created": 1549807412, "timestamp_updated": 1549807412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.68660968542098999", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48902705": {"recommendationid": "48902705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061993334", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516976212}, "language": "english", "review": "In my opinion thats the best puzzle game and there is not much more i could say.

I wrote an essay about how good it is for an English class before I wrote a review talking about how good it is.\n\nLong overdue, I honestly don't even know where to begin with this masterpiece. This game is hands down the best one I have ever played in my life. An improvement on the first one in all the right ways, this game is potentially the only singleplayer experience I have had a proper craving for, the only experience that I have genuinely felt that going back and replaying is the thing I want to be doing.\n\nIn the essay that I wrote about Portal 2, I spoke at length about all of the fancy rhetoric that the game employs to convey various emotions and force the player into a mindset. The big thing I noticed was how well the game uses the physically small map to portray this MASSIVE sense of scale. In the essay I focused more on how it forces the player into experiencing something akin to a \"trapped freedom\", where you have the opportunity to do whatever you want but in a certain space. In retrospect, I should simply have written about the way that the game conveys lonely companionship, fearful trust, and reliance on someone openly trying to kill you. It tears out your deepest emotions and plays with them, trying to and succeeding in making you feel two conflicting emotions simultaneously. This is a powerful way to write a story and Portal 2 pulls it off flawlessly.\n\nWith a mix of top-tier voice acting, fluid animation, realistic interactions, interesting characters, an amazing story, the usage of a silent protagonist, and the lack of cutscenes entirely, the game feels realistic and involved. The game doesn't break immersion for a second. While remaining tense, it manages to employ humour, and does everything tastefully.\n\nI can't rave about everything in one review because it frankly will turn into another 20 page essay like the last one did. The TL;DR of this is that the game does everything a game should do flawlessly.\n\n\nThis is the best game ever made and nothing can change my mind.", "timestamp_created": 1551191244,

My brother's friend came over with the 360 disc and I stayed up all night playing. Then, of course, he took the game when he left. I immediately wanted to continue playing,  I was hooked from that point forward. Played through the entirety of it on some awful computer and getting 20 FPS average. It was worth every second of it, honestly. \n\nThe campaign is, of course, one of the standout singleplayer modes of gaming. The difficulty curve is well-done, the humor is always well-executed and there's tons of places to listen to additional dialogue if you feel like waiting to see what happens.\nThen, of course, the co-op is a solid continuation of said singleplayer but continues the curve with the addition of a second set of portals and, of course, another person to cooperate with. I have tons of good memories with friends and randoms alike, especially the moments where you have to decide if you REALLY want to solve right then and there or if you want to move the bridge your partner's relying on.\nAnd, to top it all off, there's a leaderboard system that allows you to go for least time/portals with your friends. To this day I occasionally check on my scores to make sure nobody's beaten them, and it's always a pleasant surprise when someone has.\n\nAll in all, the game's simply amazing. If the fact that it's the #1 rated game on Steam with 121,015 Positive reviews to 1,586 Negative doesn't indicate its sheer quality, I don't know what will. It's a great game that came from a time when Valve still made them, and it will forever hold a special place in my heart.", "timestamp_created": 1529354112, "timestamp_updated": 1529354112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 113, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.905583381652832031", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32146693": {"recommendationid": "32146693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111239207", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1530490553}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, makes you feel somewhat smart", "timestamp_created": 1496476577, "timestamp_updated": 1496476577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2284, "votes_funny": 382, "weighted_vote_score": "0.944925010204315186", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47288164": {"recommendationid": "47288164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257571805", "num_games_owned": 546, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1527387106}, "language": "english", "review": "===[ Audience: ]=== \n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Everyone\n\u2610 Casual players\n\u2610 Pro players\n\n===[ Graphics: ]=== \n\u2610 Potato\n\u2610 Really bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 OK\n\u2611 Good \n\u2610 Beautiful \n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\n===[Price/quality: ]=== \n\u2611 Full price\n\u2610 Wait for sale \n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Refund it if you can\n\u2610 Don't do it\n\n===[ Requirments: ]=== \n\u2610 90' PC\n\u2611 Minimum\n\u2610 Medium \n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 High end \n\u2610 NASA computer\n\n===[ Difficulty: ]=== \n\u2610 You just need 2 arms \n\u2610 Ez\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master \n\u2610 Hard (first few hours)\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n\n===[ Game time/length ]===\n\u2610 Really short ( 0 - 2 hours) (5 Minutes)\n\u2610 Short ( 2 - 8 hours)\n\u2611 Few hours ( 8 - 12 hours)\n\u2610 Long ( 12+ hours)\n\u2611 Endless\n\n===[ Story] === \n\u2610 It doesn't have\n\u2610 Still better than Twilight \n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Fantastic\n\n===[ Bugs ]=== \n\u2610 Game itself is one big BUG\n\u2610 Bugs destroying the game\n\u2610 Lot of bugs\n\u2610 Few Bugs\n\u2610 You can use them for speedrun\n\u2611 Nothing\n~~~~~~~\nGraphics:\t\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nSound:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nGameplay:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nMusic:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nOverall:\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n~~~~~~~\nGLaDOS is Bae!", "timestamp_created": 1543914309, "timestamp_updated": 1543914309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 243, "votes_funny": 51, "weighted_vote_score": "0.929200947284698486", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45773754": {"recommendationid": "45773754", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174626169", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546887190}, "language": "english", "review": "need portal 3", "timestamp_created": 1541998190, "timestamp_updated": 1541998190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 171, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.914803385734558105", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14590312": {"recommendationid": "14590312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118881834", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1533230046}, "language": "english", "review": "I have no idea why I waited so long to review this game. Here goes nothing, and I hope you rate this up. If you already know a thing or two or hate reading, visit my Pros and Cons section as it helped many customers decide if this game is right for them!\n-------------------------------\n[b]Intro[/b]\nYou know how when you are on vacation and say, \"I am so glad it isn't winter right now.\"? Yeah, that sums up the power this game has on you. When you play the game, it is so...crisp (Vacation-like) and when you have to leave, it is like that miserable winter I was talking about.\n-------------------------------\n[b]Summary:[/b]\nThis game, as you should know from some other reviews and through the fact that it is one of the best selling games of all time, leaves an effect on the player. It is a beautiful story-line. You play as a female test subject through the campaign. She (I won't spoil her name) is forced through many tests GLaDOS (a powerful robot who took over Aperture) has prepared for her. You learn a lot about this character as you portal around puzzles of rooms, and a lot is learned about yourself. The programed-to-be \"idiot\" (whom you will find out through the game) is something to look out for as you think he is helping you escape. It is a clever twist. You will learn that the industry you are escaping from used to be a shower curtain/part factory. Yeah, It will all make sense when you play. \n-------------------------------\n[b]Multi-Player[/b]\nThen there is the multi-player mode with Atlas and P-body who are trying to free the humans or whatever. That itself (with a partner) is totaly worth a lot of Friday nights. Now that they are implementing items/loadouts into the game (or hats/taunts/clothes/flags to those who are uncertain of the term), the game will be more interesting. Now, I may not have many hours, but I assure you that I have beaten multi-player in about 4 hours, and the single player in 3. I mean, the rest of my hours come from exploring more/community maps. And that is the amazing thing about this game...no matter how many times you have beaten it, it is still fun. Also playing multi-player with a different friend every time makes you find a lot out about their creativity/teamwork/leadership/meatal abilities.\n-------------------------------\n[b]Other important things[/b]\nThe many achievements with variety are also something to look on about. There are many things you will NEVER notice no matter how many times you play unless you YouTube some of it. The deeper you dig into the storyline, the more interesting you find the game. There were many rumors that we are still uncertain of, which makes this excellent.\n\nTo dumb it down:\n-------------------------------\n[u][b]Pros[/b][/u]\n+Amazing graphics for a non-stop beautiful gameplay. \n+Wonderful audio and music for a great experience. \n+Well-designed maps and challenges. \n+Unlimited maps (user-created). \n+Fantastic story-line. \n+Many users own this game. (Lol I remember the commercials). \n+Holiday sales make buying this game super affordable.\n+Gender neutral.\n[u][b]++Helps with cognitive brain activity[/b][/u].\n-------------------------------\n[u][b]Cons[/b][/u]\n-Limited story-line (I wish there was more to it, but there is always Portal 1). \n-Some levels take seconds while others take many minutes. (Not really progressive difficulty wise in my opinion, which isn't a bad thing here [spoiler]to me[/spoiler].)\n-Limited campaign exploration. (Some repetitive looking levels here and there.) \n-Restricted to the short story line. (However, there are some mods which are amazing, but if you want more, you have to manually download them instead of them being included with the game.)\n-------------------------------\n[b]My opinionated review[/b]\nI would say the cons are so minor that I shouldn't even have mentioned them because it may not make you buy the game. DO NOT let that happen. Get this game. I recommend buying during a sale to get Portal 1 and 2 for a cheap price together for the full experience (because they raised the price of this game recently). This is a classic game and will go down in history as one of the best - revolutionizing the way we think/game. It was such an amazing thought that I hope you guys consider for yourselves.\n-------------------------------\n[b]Rating[/b]\nOut of 100, there is nothing wrong with this game. You may not like it if you aren't creative, don't have friends to play it with, or can't appreciate an amazing \"Portal transportation\" concept. But listen, you will fall in love with this game and stack hours to it. There is no community to worry about other than wonderfully made maps from users like you. Definately get this game if you don't have it - that being said, my review shouldn't even matter. I would give this a [spoiler]97/100[/spoiler] after all of that. I hope you read everything before looking at my rating.\n-------------------------------\n[b]Finally[/b]\nThanks so much for reading, so I hope you share the love and rate this review up, as it took some thought to make. If you are still wondering whether you should get the game or not...well it always will be a must-have, and YES! Get it!\n~thedubmark\n(I write reviews now :))", "timestamp_created": 1424592159, "timestamp_updated": 1511666482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 334, "votes_funny": 56, "weighted_vote_score": "0.932653605937957764", "comment_count": 41, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7770987": {"recommendationid": "7770987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007921819", "num_games_owned": 1159, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1530088753}, "language": "english", "review": "The best game ever made by Valve.

I'm still clueless how they set the bar for their prequel this high and even provided with a better sequel. I can't wait to jump into the co-op function honestly since the singleplayer was this good.\n\nValve literally took a look at Portal and said what could we improve towards the sequel. They added new general features like a loading screen, which I didn't find mandatory, and you can see where your portals are placed through walls. They stuck with similar ideas to complete their puzzles and added loads of new ways to solve puzzles and move along the map. Speaking of puzzles, they added so many, that it seems that the game is twice as long as the prequel. They added lasers and with them you have cubes which you can use to direct the lasers in any way you want.  You have bouncing pads and on walls you see indicators which show where you land. You have bridges to guide you around the map. You also have floating pads which can work in two directions but only when triggered by a button. Finally you have three kinds of gel red blue and white. Red gel gives you a speed boost. Blue gel gives you a jumping boost and white gel allows you to portal on it, mainly for places that you couldn't portal on before.\n\nObviously the things previously said aren't the ones that baffled me but it is mainly the environment. The story is amazingly well built and it teaches us more about apeture sciences. It also contains a few plot twists here and there. The places you visit are fairly new but you'll visit some well remembered places from portal. Something they also introduced is companions, the most part of the game you'll have a object travelling with you. One of them is a funny little core with a british accent. Aside from entertaining you the bots can help you sometimes to get to certain paths. The jokes are as good as last game so expect a good laugh.\n\nI highly recommend  that you buy this game, and play it for the rest of the day or week. Turn off your notification, because the game doesn't support tabbing, and enjoy this gem for many and many times you want and are supposed to complete the story.

Throughout the game, the plot makes a interesting twists. Individual deserves compliments perfect finale, after which there remain only a warm feeling. In Portal 2 no epic stories, huge explosions, incredible action, or the salvation of humanity. Instead, there is a charismatic characters, intelligent humor and interesting puzzles.\n\n\u3000ONE IS GOOD, BUT TWO IS BETTER\n\n\u3000\u3000One of the achievements of the new Portal has been the emergence of the cooperative. Co-op story is a continuation of the plot of the single player. At first I thought that the only difference of the cooperative is the presence of two players with portal-guns, instead of one. In fact, the cooperative has unique ideas. Many puzzles solving quite differently. I advise you not to play cooperative with a random person (there is that possibility), and play it with a good friend.\n\n\u3000ENDLESS TESTS\n\n\u3000\u3000In game was added a level editor, so anyone can create their own test chambers or try to play the levels of other players. To be honest, most of the player-created levels are too simple or ridiculous. But there is sufficient interesting maps (and some of them really hard).

He and I did the Coop together, prior to doing the single-player mode. Bothwas definitely a blast!\n\nPortal 2 has all the ingredients to being a great physics puzzle game, along with the interesting story in the solo-mode. For Coop, you play as Atlas or P-body who must solve all the puzzles presented in each stage, as instructed by GLaDOS. I will not go into too much detail of who GLaDOS is, but this feminine voiced AI is not exactly the brightest guide, with good intentions. She has made sinister comments towards the players, or individually as a way to cut down trust and teamwork, despite the entire point of Coop mode being working together. I\u2019ve heard GLaDOS mention things like me performing better than my partner, and vice-versa as well as hints of betrayal. All of which I find hilarious. Both Coop and Solo mode has these factors, which keeps the entire game very interactive and thrilling, despite Portal 2 being a puzzle game. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our times of thinking, testing and trying tricks and tactics to get the level cleared.\n\nIn solo mode, we continue off from it\u2019s prequel, playing as the main character Chell, who mistakenly stars up GLaDOS while in the Aperture science laboratory. GLaDOS is, of course, the antagonist [spoiler]at least for the first half[/spoiler]. We\u2019re guided by Wheatley, another AI residing in Aperture Science for some period of time [spoiler]until GLaDOS is taken down[/spoiler]. Regardless of which mode you play, there is also some fourth wall breaking too, where the player is challenged to act against what they are instructed to do. Plot twists and dark truths about the Aperture Science laboratory are implied/hinted within certain stages if you look hard enough.\n\nThe graphics and audio are what you\u2019d expect from Portal, if not better. The soundtrack had songs like \u201cWant you gone\u201d and the \u201cTurret Opera\u201d song from the end of the game, which were stuck in my head after completing the solo mode. No complaints here!\n\nMy only negative experience for the game is that I was incapable of playing it for prolonging hours due to motion sickness. Portal 2 will have your screen spinning, flipping and some flashing graphics here and there, so make sure you have the settings set right before letting nausea ruin the experience lol.\n\nSteam achievements, a workshop for custom levels, and a scoreboard exists for if you want to play competitively in each stage/level.

It builds on the foundation of its acclaimed predecessor, takes all the gameplay elements that made it great and vastly improves them in every aspect. With that said, I strongly recommend to play Portal first. If you don't you will still play through the sequel without any confusion, Portals plot was minimal (even though exceptionally well-written) and the basic puzzle design is picked up in Portal 2. But you would miss out on a great game and why would you want to do that?\n\nOnce again you take over Chell, Portals female protagonist, who finds herself rudely awakened from a cryogenic sleep and imprisoned in a small chamber inside the Aperture Science testing facility, an environment vaguely familiar from Portal - vaguely because a lot seems to have changed since your first time around. Some of the structures at the beginning of the game are indeed places you have already seen during your first escape but this time they are clearly aged, in a state of decay, overgrown with plants and seemingly abandoned. But soon you will have to make your way through unknown terrain and new test chambers that turn out to be anything but abandoned. Fans of Portal will be pleased to learn that GLaDOS makes its reappearance. Something else is different right from the start: You are now accompanied by a british-accented robot named Wheatley, who insists that an escape can only be accomplished together.\n\nPortal 2 really shines in the writing department, the story is much more developed compared to the first installment. Many unanswered questions are revealed, such as bits and pieces of Aperture Sciences history and the origin of GLaDOS personality. Where GLaDOS was Portals only speaking character you now get to hear your goofy sidekick Wheatley and, through pre-recorded messages, Aperture Science founder Cave Johnson. All voice actors did an outstanding job and manage to really bring all three speaking characters to life.\n\nIf you played first-person shooters before you will be instantly familiar with the controls, mouse for camera movement, WASD to move, space to jump and left & right mouse buttons to shoot your portal gun. All game mechanics from Portal like pressure buttons, disintegration fields and of course the eponymous blue and orange portals, that are surprisingly simple in theory but make for surprisingly diverse and challenging puzzles, made it into the sequel and in addition many more are added: different sorts of gel that let you jump higher or run faster, catapults, light bridges, air tubes and lasers. Each element of its own already makes for complex puzzles but once the game starts to combine several of them you're in for a real challenge.\n\nCompared to its predecessor, the game provides a lot more content. Not only is the single player campaign about twice as long, it even adds an extensive second co-op campaign. Two players open a lot more puzzle opportunities and the devs managed to use them to their fullest. But don't worry, you are given various means of communication. It's recommended to simply plugin your headset and make use of Steams voice chat feature but even if you don't you can still highlight spots by simply pressing a key, start countdowns to synchronize your actions, open a small screen that lets you look through the eyes of your co-op partner and perform small gestures to communicate non-verbally. Or you could just utilize the ingame chat to write.\n\nBut it doesn't end here. Thanks to user generated content the replayability is almost unlimited. When you mastered both campaigns, just tap into the huge library of player generated chambers, even whole campaigns are available to download, and keep playing with ever new challenges.\n\nWhen you compare the visuals to Portal you cannot help but appreciate the excellent graphic design. While Portals test chambers looked bland and lifeless, they're now impoved with many small details. You have moving, transforming environments, plants growing through cracks in the walls and especially the vast, subterranean areas later in the game are a stunning sight.\n\nLong story short: Portal 2 takes the premise of its predecessor and takes it to a whole new level.

I still haven't completed the single player story but I still wanted to write this review because of how much I'm enjoying it so far and how much I enjoyed playing the co-op. It feels extremely satisfying whenever you finally figure out a part without looking it up online that you've been stuck on for ages. There never was a part during the co-op that I started feeling bored. The co-op does a great job of making it so that both people need to be doing something instead of just one person doing everything on their own. For the single player you should finish Portal 1 before you start playing otherwise some of the story will confuse you. I struggled to find any cons for this game. It goes without saying, you need to get this classic and don't forget about the co-op.\n\n[u]Rating:[/u]\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1540982475, "timestamp_updated": 1540983144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.790877223014831543", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32421649": {"recommendationid": "32421649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034570087", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494459749}, "language": "english", "review": "Great story!

This are the repulsion gel, the propulsion gel and the conversion gel.\n\nThe plot is pretty well written and even you haven't played the first game, you'll undestand the story as the game doesn't require a deep understanding of the first game. The characters in this game feel alive and are very charismatic, from the ironic and twisted GladOS, to the incompetent and dumb Wheatley. The humor is well done and the dialogues, specially in the later scenarios are totally hilarious. \n\nThe aesthetics are amazingly beautiful and also you'll have a lot of this so called screenshot opportunities, even if you are playing with a low end rig, you'll be amazed of the beauty that can spawn from the source engine, an engine that has been around since ages.\n\nAnd the last but not less important aspect of the game, the soundtrack, from the first time you awake from your long time sleep to the last song, the OST is not only fitting, but also feels like grabbing science and adapting it into an mp3 format. You guys did an excellent job with it, as it adds a lot to the experience.\n\nOverall, I recommend it to every time of gamer and non gamer, if you want to get into gaming, try this game. If you love fps, try this game, if you love puzzles, give this game a go, and if you're a Valve fan, why are you reading this review in the first place?

Portal 2 incorporates a campaign that allows you to solve challenging puzzles while treating you to a strong and simple storyline. This review will discuss the campaign, the voice acting, dialogue, and the co-op feature.\n\nPortal 2 features a quality campaign that emphasises creativity through overcoming puzzles and excels in superb voice acting that includes funny humour. You begin the campaign as Chell, a female character holding a portal gun. Chell completes tests using her portal gun while being monitored by AI computer system Glados, voiced by Ellen McLain. Chell completes these tests while listening to Wheatley, a programming core that is voiced by Stephen Merchant, in which he wants to escape the facility. The puzzles are diverse and I do not grasp the notion they are repetitive. They do in fact become more difficult as the game progresses which is due to new things being added to each level that add a new layer of complexity. For instance, some levels feature turrets that can spray bullets at you, which you must destroy before advancing. Portal 2 has a really good ending that ends the story with an amazing final mission that mixes both emotion and intensity. Furthermore, the ending smoothly transitions into the credits that completely alter the atmosphere into a beautiful light hearted finale, complete with a song sung by Glados. Briefly, the single player experience does have some annoying glitches with freezing when pressing R for the feedback prompt and frequent crashing via alt tabbing. These two issues had minimal impact on my experience of the game.\n\nThe dialogue enhances the single player component by incorporating witty humour with dialogue that provides excellent characterisation to the characters. For instance, events showcase characters change of heart and provide some emotion to their robot personalities. This creates a juxtaposition of humans and robots because the game reveals human traits of emotion, self-interest for personal gain, and relationships with other individuals within Glados and Wheatley, both whom are robots. The voice acting in Portal 2 complement the strong dialogue because individually, Stephen Merchant delivers a memorable and excellent performance for Wheatley by striking different voice tones that match different situations within the game. Meanwhile, Ellen McLain provides a good voice line to showcase the personality and character of Glados. The dialogue and voice acting immediately created a sense of whose a protagonist and antagonist in the simple story of hero vs. villain.\n\nThe co-op element of Portal 2 provides more levels to lengthen the game. These levels add some exciting fresh dynamics to each level because you have to cooperate with your team mate and depend on the other to complete levels. For instance, I had to stand on a button while my friend flew to the other side of the window to retrieve the block in order to complete the level.\n\n[h1] [b] Conclusion [/b] [/h1]\nPortal 2 is a good and challenging puzzle game that emphasises creativity and excels in the simplicity of telling a story. The story nicely builds to an excellent climax that feels like a satisfying conclusion to the game. The game features beautiful voice acting and some exceptional performances from Merchant and McLain and strongly delivers in the quality of the dialogue. I am new to the puzzle genre so playing Portal 2 felt fresh and different. There are some issues outlined above in the game, but nothing that detracts from the overall experience. At $19.99, I recommend it. \n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\n[h1] [b] Pros [/b] [/h1]\n\t- The simple story that ends with an excellent climax.\n\t- Excellent voice acting.\n\t- Very good dialogue. \n\t- The challenging and increasingly complex puzzles.\n\t- Length.\n\n[h1] [b] Cons [/b] [/h1]\n\t- Annoying glitches with the R feedback prompt in single player and frequent crashes via alt tabbing.\n\t\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Wheatley's goal is to help you escape, however you soon find out that GLaDOS is still alive. Chell is once again forced to use her portal gun to navigate the ruins of the facility and deal with the resurrected GLaDOS. The story takes some very interesting twists and turns along the way and the terrific dark humor of the first game remains intact.\nThe gameplay from the original game returns in all of its mind-bending glory. Players use the portal gun to shoot blue and orange colored portal holes onto walls to traverse over deadly pits, transport Weighted Storage Cubes to switches to open doors and lower elevators and redirect lasers. Additions to the gameplay include the propulsion and repulsion gels which do pretty much as they describe, either sliding the player off at great speed or sending them bouncing high into the air. In addition, players must redirect light bridges and conveyer beams with portals as well.\nOne of the most exciting new features in Portal 2 is the inclusion of co-op gameplay.\nCo-op gameplay gets its own storyline and characters, Aperture Science robots ATLAS and P-Body, each armed with their own portal gun and even more challenging puzzles for the gamers to solve. You can either play with a friend (split-screen or online) or team up with a random player.\nI highly recommend Portal 2 to anyone who is looking for a good fun game that will take up a few hours and even make you think instead of the average First Person Shooter. \nOverall, Portal 2 is a masterpiece and definitely worth the money.\n\nSounds 10/10\nGraphics 10/10\nGameplay 10/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation\n\nAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA", "timestamp_created": 1373979641, "timestamp_updated": 1489171222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 243, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.843657374382019043", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "1113986": {"recommendationid": "1113986", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987050685", "num_games_owned": 804, "num_reviews": 101, "playtime_forever": 2396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1337929200}, "language": "english", "review": "Portal 2 is the phenomenal sequal to Valve's award-winning Portal. \n\nMany were dubious about Portal 2, prior to the release, due to how amazing Portal was, feeling that nothing could live up to it, unless the game were truly amazing.

It boasts a longer, more diverse campaign that still manages to hold on to the humor, atmosphere, and overall quality that made the original so enjoyable. It also boasts a new cooperative mode, which brings the experience to a new level. And to top it off, with Steam Workshop integration, the possibilities for new content become limitless.\n\nIn the campaign, all of the strengths from the first game return and are fine-tuned to perfection. The puzzles are more diverse and interesting, with more advanced mechanics introduced. The atmosphere is even more fleshed out and enticing. The dialogue is even more hilarious and entertaining. And to top it all off, the game is about twice as long.\n\nAfter that, there is also an incredibly well designed cooperative mode, complete with its own characters and puzzles. This adds what is effectively another whole game to the mix, which is a very welcome addition.\n\nAnd to top it all off, with the Steam Workshop integration, there is endless possibilities for new puzzle rooms in both single-player and cooperative modes. Not all of it is great, of course, but some of it is arguably better than the real game.  It is a gift that just keeps on giving.\n\nWith the gameplay being so intuitive and enjoyable, and the limitless possibilities of the Workshop, [b]Portal 2[/b] rockets to the clouds as a deity among video games.  It is hands-down one of the absolute best games in existence.  If you haven\u2019t yet tried it, now is the time.

I do recommend that you play the first one in order to fully understand the whole story and for you to be familiar with the concept of Portals ^_^\n\nYou play as Chell, a mute girl that just does what she does :/ I seriously don't know what's going on in her head xD anyways, you wake up in a room years and years after the events of Portal and the adventure starts there.... Let the testing begin >:) \n\nStory is well-driven and easy to follow. Although the game features more/less 5 characters (including Cave Johnson and Caroline). They're so lively and have their own iconic personalities, Wheatley is awesome :D You'll never get bored of the dark humor continuously thrown at you xD I have to say that the story is a bit short compared to their flagship game, Half-Life.\n\nThe Source engine is by far my favorite. I'm playing this game at a consistent 100fps set to High/Very High.... no crashes in-game, and absolutely looks delightful (especially the lighting). It can also run very well on older systems, which is always a plus for me ^_^ Music is what you'd expect from Valve....... just pure awesomeness, nuff said xD \n\nGameplay is the same as the first game. It's not a generic shoot-everything-that-moves FPS but a puzzle-solving FPS that involves Portals and require you to have a keen observation on your surroundings and lots of thinking. I honestly was stuck on a puzzle for a good 20-mins. until I went \"Ohhhhh, now I get it\" and proceed to finish the test chamber xD It stands out because of its one-of-a-kind gameplay and does it extremely well ;)\n\nOverall Experience: I have yet to try out the co-op mode, but the single-player campaign left me wanting more.

I really really regret I haven't had the chance to playthrough the entire game for so long.

This game is very frustrating, so if you don't enjoy getting stuck while playing a game then this game is probably not for you. Otherwise, Portal 2 is a fun game that is interesting to all types of gamers. \n\nThere is a co-op  gamemode, but it's only available for local gameplay (don't quote me). There is also a steam workshop for this game so you can play community made maps.\n\nPortal 2 is not really worth $20, because the story mode gives you around 10 hours of gameplay. However, the game regularly goes on sale. Buy it at its cheapest price ($3.99).\n\nDefinitely a must buy for all clever gamers 10/10 \n\n[spoiler] Portal 3 confirmed [/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1477719235, "timestamp_updated": 1480386193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736856758594512939", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26512193": {"recommendationid": "26512193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181721735", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 2908, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1522297009}, "language": "english", "review": "Portal 2 is a great game.

It is a sequel to acclaimed by critics Portal from 2007. Until now the game was released so far on PC with Windows, Linux and OS X, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. Maybe it is just my imagination but I think being a real gamer and not hearing at peast once about this franchise is nearly impossible.\n\nThe plot continoues story of Chell, our mute protagonist after events of the first Portal is still imprisoned in Aperture's facility, this time however she has a new companion, the AI named Wheatley. During they desperate struggle to escape they accidentaly revive GLaDOS, the AI overseeing the entire project. Once again the villainous machine force us to solve puzzles and proceed through test chambers in order to survive. The story is preety great in my opinion, thanks to side characters that can be funny yet convincing all the time really make you enjoy everything, also it has some shocking plot twists and really satisfying ending.\nJust as in previous game Chell is armed with the iconic Portal Gun that can create portals on white surfaces, allowing us to move around on very creative ways. Developers also cared to add some new mechanics including pushing streams and various gels boosting our speed or height of jumps. Turrets, buttons etc. The level design often force us to think over all the movements, the solutions are not always obvious so you can spend even an hour in one chamber just on trying out what works and what not.\nSoundtrack is not only enjoyable, but also it reacts to what player does. If you walk on orange gel for example the music speeds up for a while, it really adds some immerse to the gameplay.\nThe game has it's years so at least on modern PCs you can expect flawless performance, frames does not fall ever below 60 on highest settings, besides graphics still look great.\n\nTo be honest this is propably the one of the most intense puzzle games you can find on Steam today, story does not dissapoint, gameplay require a lot of thinking, the music fits great and it is all still enjoyable despite the years. If like me you have grown on classic Tomb Raiders or other games that challenge your way of thinking you will enjoy it so much. 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1528879622, "timestamp_updated": 1528879622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.760472536087036133", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40189181": {"recommendationid": "40189181", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024990117", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518894189}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game. \n\nThe game is hilariously fun even though it must be considered as a puzzle game, but the conversations throughout the game as you progress through are simply amazing. \nYou kind of get a feeling that you just need to continue to the next chapter to get the whole story told while you progress. \n\nYou will eventually figure that robots actually have humour after this experience...\n(I would say it's worth the price, if you ever wanted to find out how it is to be a test subject, that is) \n\nI could keep typing but I have more testing to do in order to get out of here...", "timestamp_created": 1518954755, "timestamp_updated": 1518954755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.748391926288604736", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10939764": {"recommendationid": "10939764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021164991", "num_games_owned": 611, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1369033200}, "language": "english", "review": "If this game was a potato, It would be a very good potato.", "timestamp_created": 1404046939, "timestamp_updated": 1404046939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1751, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.830363452434539795", "comment_count": 67, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "44575621": {"recommendationid": "44575621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094140792", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546399925}, "language": "english", "review": "we need a portal 3", "timestamp_created": 1536111396, "timestamp_updated": 1536111396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765503823757171631", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28912713": {"recommendationid": "28912713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165510438", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 4991, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 34, "last_played": 1551758632}, "language": "english", "review": "Portal 2 is the sequel to the hit 2007 game, Portal, where you play as a test subject for Aperture Laboratories, testing a gun that shoots \"portals\", which you can travel through.\n\n[list]PROS:\n[*]Amazing graphics\n[*]Highly detailed backgrounds\n[*]One of a kind gameplay\n[*]Lots of new mechanics\n[*]Disney-tier writing (in comedy)\n[*]Co-op mode\n[*]Thousands of new tests are made every year\n[*]Several memorable characters/quotes\n\nNEUTRAL:\n[*]Some tests might be too hard for some people\n\nCONS:\nI can't think of any...
