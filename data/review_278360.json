Same goes for the level design which dips down the drain right after the first level. And the first level is a very good looking level i must say, almost deceptively good, abundant with details such as little notes replete with text , some photos and items, all that little details that gives story a context, which is always good.\n\nThe story is cute, i guess. I don't really want to say  anything negative about it. Anything that is not \"kill that guy, he be mean\" is already a plus, in my book.\n\nBut the gameplay, the gameplay is just a gigantic bore, lackluster. Run from one rock to another. Jump the rocks. Hover along the flying rocks. Seriously it's all you freaking do there, and not much else. The game seems stretched just for the sake of longevity, just so you don't refund it.\nI found myself wishing the platforming part to end at about 15 minutes in. You jump the rock - then you jump some other rock higher up thinking it would be the end of the torture , only to find more of the same dull goddamn platforming action. Worst of all is all the dull moments are followed by almost complete silence from the narrator, because some story would greatly make up for some  the tedium of the gameplay mechanics.\n\nI also feel like i shouldn't really compain, about it all since i got the game for free and all.

Don't buy the game for the story.\n-The voice acting was just horrible.\n-Most of the levels were just plain too simple and easy. \n-The characters absolutely made no sense at all.\n\nNeutral:\n-The graphics are alright for 2019, but they weren't bad to say the least.\n\nOverall, the game itself isn't too bad and if you just want to have fun with some spare time, you should play it just for the sake of having fun.

It's a unique game akin to Portal, but instead of solving puzzles using the portal gun you're figuring out traversal patterns you need to take using your spiderman hand \n\n[h1]Pros: [/h1]\n-Spiderman: The main mechanics of this game are running, jumping and swinging around like Spiderman. The progression of unlocking more abilities and interacting with different objects in the environments makes for a good pace and a nice new challenge. The feeling of accomplishment is great especially after you\u2019ve been beating your head over a difficult part and the game rewards you with a freeform easy to navigate section right afterward. \n\nNavigation/Puzzle: The game is a puzzle platformer the main puzzle in the game is figuring out how to traverse to the next area. It doesn't directly tell you how to get from point A to point B but the environment is clearly designed leading you in the general direction and you have to give it a good look around. Sometimes the game will even throw a few red herrings in your way so you have to be observant as to where you should be going. \n\nEnvironment: The game's environments are really beautiful and varied from each section. Between jungle caves to caves filled with darkness to open sky to ice caves, there is a ton of variety in what the world feels like. Alright so there's a lot of caves but the games make a good job making each fill different between dealing with a monstrous worm to using falling stalagmites to traverse each one has a unique mechanic that changes up the gameplay. \n\n[h1]Neutral: [/h1]\n-Story/Characters: The story is kind of bare minimum, you are the narrator and you're telling a story of how you went to a strange world and looked for your uncle. Throughout it, you meet like two or three characters who just kind of go along with you. A lot of the dialogue is told through clunky lines like \u201cI don\u2019t fit in here\u201d and \u201cI wanted to protect her\u201d even though none of it is shown. Whenever the narrator is talking it's relatively fine and enjoyable but when you interact with characters it a bit lacking. The game also gives you extra story bits if you find random things in the environment to trigger it, it's a nice incentive to explore but it hinders the game's story further if you haven't found all of them. \n\n[h1]Cons: [/h1]\nHumanoids: As pretty as the environments are, the humanoids in the game are terrifyingly unnerving. They try to make them move and look around as if they were interacting with each other but it just looks stilted and unnatural. Their eyes are so large it's hard not of focus on them and they just blankly stare off into the distance. It just makes them creepy looking. \n", "timestamp_created": 1551733050, "timestamp_updated": 1551733050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504470467567443848", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49302649": {"recommendationid": "49302649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034041236", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 153, "last_played": 1551475458}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, but short.", "timestamp_created": 1551475541, "timestamp_updated": 1551475541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48837499": {"recommendationid": "48837499", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985112490", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549495364}, "language": "english", "review": "If you see the demos and screenshot and wonder \"Is this game for me?\" don't get this. \n\nIf you're curious and say to yourself \"Oh this sounds like it's got an interesting mystery\" don't get this.\n\nIf you say \"Oh yes!

Yeah, you. The one looking through the reviews to see if you are interested in buying this game. You are most likely here because you happened to find this game on Steam, and realized that Leafy used it for some of his videos back when he was relevant. I was just like you are now, accept I didn't look at any reviews. Well, I'm here to tell you that I have never disliked a game as much as this one during my initial blind playthrough, and just in 2 hours I have a multitude of complaints that I should not have.\n\nI will give this game a few positive remarks:\n\nThe gameplay has many minor innovations that make it feel fairly well polished. It starts very basic, but you end up with many new abilities I never would have thought I could have gotten at the end, and I can appreciate how this game plays (mostly). A minor issue I find with the gameplay is the new abilities not being added to the help menu. I played about an hour of the game, sat on it for a few weeks, and came back to forget about an ability I had just picked up. The game had no indication I had just picked it up, and I had to go watch a speedrun of the section I was in to realize I had picked up a new ability before I quit playing that made the section ahead of me possible.\n\nThe backgrounds are pretty neat, especially the one in the second to last section where you can see the last section off in the distance. There weren't any times I was taken aback by anything presented visually in the game, but there is clear effort put into the backgrounds and sceneries and I have to point that out as a positive.\n\nBut that's really where the positives end.\n\nThe thing I see the most from other reviews are complaints about the abysmal story and voice acting, and this is my biggest complaint with this game. The only character I felt any remorse for throughout the whole entire story is the daughter of the narrator for having to sit through such an anti-climactic and boring bedtime story. The voice actors all feel like robots, slowly and inhumanly reading through very awkwardly written dialogue they were programmed to read from. Nothing said in this game feels naturally said, and the biggest thing people look for with voice actors is how natural they make the scene feel. Well, I was so negatively impacted by the voice acting at first that I had to turn off the voice volume during my first session of playing through this game because I couldn't handle it. I eventually turned it back on after the stupid frog lady left me alone, and thankfully there wasn't much for dialogue from that point forward so I could handle it.\n\nAlthough the gameplay was the best part about this game, it also dragged my enjoyment of it down a whole lot. The crystals near the halfway point that refill your grapple are the worst part of all of it because you have to be at a very specific part of the world for each of them to work. I spent at least 10 extra minutes dying to parts where I needed to refill my grapple, where I missed the one specific part I had to do it from, so it wouldn't activate until I came back and tried it again. The physics are also fairly janky to begin with. Some sections feel like pure luck if you get past it because the game decides to fling you in a direction that makes it 50 times harder than it's supposed to be. I started disliking the gameplay so much around an hour and a half in, that I just rushed through the rest of the game as fast as I could in order to stop playing it. Luckily this game is only 2 hours, so I was able to handle it for that small of a time period.\n\nI have never seen character designs as ugly as the characters in this game. I get the people I'm meeting are mutant frog things, but they look so disgusting I wasn't sure if I was playing a N64 game or not while looking at them. Their bodies are fine, but the way everyone's faces are designed is vomit inducing and I had to stop myself from laughing every time I looked at anybody because of how ugly everyone is. Even Fred, a normal human being, has design traits that make him look abhorrent. \n\nOverall, I really liked this game to start out with, but being subjected to 2 hours of the janky and clearly unfinished gameplay, and the horrific voice acting and story line, makes this one of my least favorite games I have on my Steam library, and I would not recommend it all.", "timestamp_created": 1551400561, "timestamp_updated": 1551400561, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48962038": {"recommendationid": "48962038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103839440", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 166, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550033436}, "language": "english", "review": "A boring platforming walking sim.\n\nFor a platformer the first thing that is needed is to make it feel good to move around the 3D space and have it control good.\nThis game does not", "timestamp_created": 1550033513, "timestamp_updated": 1550033513, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501742184162139893", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48920170": {"recommendationid": "48920170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081909939", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549869808}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n- Fun parkour mechanics\n- Multiple ways to solve most sections\n- Very satisfying to pull off a string of great moves\n\nCons:\n- Too short (it took me 2 hours to complete the game, but about 45 minutes of that was on trying to get that damn \"Maddie's Challenge\" achievement)\n- Horrible writing\n- Hilariously bad voice acting\n- Atrocious 3D graphics for the characters (the rest of the game is fine, but I can't believe how bad the \"people\" look)\n\nI got this while it was free.

Fred was known to be able to climb mountains at the age of 52. Theres a newspaper on the wall in the epilogue that says that.\n\nFred probably died during a climbing accident by falling into a crevice or similar. His body has never been found (hence the memorial). \n\nThe story is the story the kid made up in his head to imagine how his uncle could have survived, he viewed him as a genius (he was expert in quantum physics as a wall says), and imagined that in his ice tomb he survived with a mystical travel device, that he was living with happy and nice creatures in a small paradise inside the mountains... He imagined himself traveling in that world. just like his uncle did, to find him again, but, in the end, lose him forever (admit his death).\n\nThat's why you don't get to open the locker in the end, and there is no launch pad. That story never happened. \n\nThat's also why the glowing message in the final ice room before you quit your uncle is translated \"Acceptance\".\n\nOther secret words, once translated say \"Denial\" (portal) and in caverns \"Anger\".

The game has great sound and music design, surreal environments, jaw-dropping visuals, and much, much more.\n\nThe story not only puts emphasis on the main plot and characters, but also on the side plot and side characters. You play as a dad telling his daughter a story about how his uncle, Fred, goes missing and how the dad goes after him. The father comes across his uncles' invention, a suit which has a grappling hook and lets you take no fall damage, to help the dad find his uncle. On your journey you will traverse through a multitude of different environments, while meeting numerous side characters that will help you on your way. The narrative is the soul of the game, but it's done in a simple and subtle manner that you, the player, have to explore and ultimately piece it all together.\n\nThe game focuses on movement, speed, freedom, and light puzzle solving instead of violence. Movement is the core element of the game. With the help of your grappling hook, you feel so free and fast; flying without restrictions and at uncontrollable speeds. It feels so genuine and fluid that it immerses you into this unique world. WASD moves your character, shift to sprint, LMB to use your grappling hook, Space to jump, hold RMB to power jump, and Shift and hold RMB for powerleap. Almost every new platform is a checkpoint where it gives you a certain amount of charges for your grappling hook. And then you have to use your charges and your skills wisely to get to the next checkpoint. Also, Later in the game you get rocket boots to help you through the harder parts of the game.\n\nLike I said before, the graphics are very stunning. ASAMU runs on the Unreal Engine 3 and by god this game looks fantastic. It has gorgeous lighting effects, great world design, phenomenal texture work, and a fantastic attention to detail. Also the art style is very vibrant and dark at the same time; using greens, blues, and browns to convey the mood of the game. Sadly, character models are pretty outdated.\n\nThe sound and music design is absolutely brilliant. The sound is very immersive and completely engages the player into the game itself. The \"Whoosh\" that you hear when you soar through the massive levels is incredible and gives the player a huge adrenaline rush. The game exhibits an emotional, heart-felt, and melancholy symphonic, fantasy soundtrack. Voice acting is somewhat good and somewhat bad. The protagonist, the daughter, and the town elder are voiced well, while everyone else is poorly voiced.\n\n[b]Additional Notes:[/b] This game has an FOV slider that can be adjusted from 60-120 FOV. There are 15 Steam achievements and the game is about 5-7 hrs. (depending on playstyle) and has a time trial mode. The game also features gorgeous water effects, best looking vegetation I've ever seen, beautiful architecture/ cityscapes, and stunning rock designs and textures. The devs are SO nice and are on the forums to answer questions and complaints!\n\n[b]Final Thoughts:[/b] A Story About My Uncle is Gone North Games' very first game and it is a masterpiece with phenomenal sound, music, atmosphere, immersion, graphics, gameplay, and a gorgeous world to explore. However, the game does suffer from character models that are not up-to-date, ok voice acting, and a poorly translated script. Overall, I can recommend this game to anyone looking for an immersive first person adventure with an unique world and tale to tell. And is most definitely worth $12.99.\n\n*Review copy was provided by Gone North Games; Thank you very much!*", "timestamp_created": 1401130388, "timestamp_updated": 1412699292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 216, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.89884573221206665", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24586626": {"recommendationid": "24586626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162936335", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1530171072}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, This game was absoloutly amazing!

I think that this should\u2019ve been given to you in the beginning of the game, and then taken away halfway through. This would help players just learning the system, and add a layer of challenge to the latter half.

So keep my warnings of \"difficulty\" in perspective.  If you're decent at 3D platformers, you'll be fine.  I don't want to scare anybody away from a great game.  Anyway, on with the review.]\n\nIt's possible this was the most difficult game I've ever completed-- with more deaths than I care to contemplate. [Update: okay, I probably died more in Ori.]  Of my listed 18.4 hours, I'm sure there was some idling there-- but not more than a few hours.  I also like to explore, enjoy the beautiful scenery, and take things slowly.  I never claim to be super-skilled at 3D-platformers, but this really stretched my abilities.  It was easier for me once I switched from a controller to keyboard+mouse, but I'm not much of a console/controller person.  Thank God the devs toned down a notoriously difficult section; I'm not sure I would have made it.  But the important part is that I persevered because I loved the game:  it had charm, a good story, superb graphics, and usually fun gameplay when I wasn't on the verge of a rage-quit.  ;-)  There's really nothing like flying through the air like Spiderman with a jetpack.  You really have to try it.\n\nSome folks probably won't find it overly challenging and kudos to you-- but don't be surprised if it takes some real work and repetition-- I'm not sure why this game is put in the \"Casual\" genre.  Some of the difficulty can be alleviated at times by finding an optimal/alternate solution.  So if you find yourself stuck, look for an alternative approach instead of assuming the game is broken, unfair, or just poorly designed.  It's not-- it's probably you.\n\nIf you're looking for cheap achievements-- look elsewhere.

A Story About My Uncle is itself a bedtime story, albeit one not constrained to mere words but created in vibrant detail allowing you to explore it for yourself while still retaining that magical quality that only comes from a friendly voice telling you a story before you inevitably shut your eyes.\n\nWhile the title may lead to believe differently, ASAMU actually focuses on the titular uncle\u2019s nephew; a daring young lad who, taking after his uncle, has an endless curiosity about the world around him and an irresistible urge to explore it. So it would stand to reason that upon visiting his uncle\u2019s workshop and finding it empty, save a small futuristic suit in just his size, that he would strap it on and set out to find where his uncle has made off to.\n\nAside from the quick opening taking place in a setting resembling the one we ourselves live in, ASAMU is firmly planted in a marvelously imaginative world of its own creation. Huge floating rock structures populated with glowing foliage and villages of frog like inhabitants paint an enchanting local to explore, or simply admire from a standstill for its beauty. For as straightforward as the narrative is, the further I progressed the more intrigued I became about the place I was exploring, and longed to learn more about what had sparked all of it into being.\n\nUnfortunately, ASAMU hasn\u2019t anywhere near enough time to explore everything it presents before you, or in fact touch on anything for more than a brief moment before the end is before you after only 2-3 hours. It\u2019s incredibly disappointing because developer Gone North Games achieves so much in this time in getting me interested in the world and lore it created, but ends the experience well before it has a chance to expand on any of it leaving me with a distinct lack of closure. It\u2019s like having an amazing dream, and just as you\u2019re beginning to get into it you\u2019re woken with a start and no matter how hard you try can\u2019t find it again.\n\nWhen you art admiring the locals (or deploring their brevity), you\u2019re soaring through the air using the prior mentioned suit, the abilities of which grant you an incredible amount of agility. The foremost of these is a grapple ability which lets you grab ahold of structures and use them to propel you forward. Combined with a super jump and sprint ability this creates an exhilarating means of travel, making you feel like a parkour running that\u2019s made off with the claw from Bionic Commando as you rush through levels swinging from point to point. When you get into a flow it feels like little else I\u2019ve ever played, and has me wishing more games attempted to do first person platforming this way, but here is you come up against a bit of a roadblock.\n\nWhile the tools to string together grapples and jumps are all within your hands, you\u2019re shackled with severe limitations on how you can use them which quickly turns to frustration as you find yourself repeatedly falling into bottomless pits. You are given a set number of grapples you can perform before landing, but levels are designed in a way that requires you to take a specific path through them jumping and swinging at just the right moment, essentially removing all form of experimentation from the player. There is so much potential here that for the developers to make such an easily remedied mistake is a huge shame, and one which greatly diminished my enjoyment of the game. I\u2019d have even accepted an unlockable cheat which removes these limitations, as being able to traverse levels without constantly having to plan each moment out would feel incredible, but instead the mechanics hurt themselves by over restricting the player and taking away a lot of what could have been an amazing platforming system.\n\nEven had it not come from a small studio, I would have been very impressed with the graphical work achieved in the environments and especially the sparse use of color to outline paths and present a contrast to the various areas you visit. Though largely taking place in caves, each level feels entirely distinct to itself, from the suffocating darkness of a deep chasm to the breathtaking vistas of a world existing above the clouds. Almost every moment offers an amazing view, made all the more exciting by the speed you typically move through them, and the fact it was accomplished by an indie developer makes it even more unexpected.\n\nI do wish I could say as kind things about the voice acting, which unfortunately is among the worst of any game in recent memory. Full of awkward inflections and strange pauses, the cast does a rather poor job masking the fact they are almost certainly not native english speakers, and the strange disconnect between them and what they are saying makes it hard not to groan whenever someone opens their mouth to try and deliver a line. I don\u2019t mean to be so hard on a group that seems to at least have tried really hard to give a good performance, but I can\u2019t gloss over the fact that it\u2019s just abysmal all around and had me tempted to turn it off entirely and get by on subtitles alone.\n\nA Story About My Uncle is a hugely ambitious game for an entirely new developer, which almost inevitably didn\u2019t manage to quite hit the mark. It\u2019s riddled with flaws from almost every angle, which when piled upon each other make it a rather hard sell. Poor voice acting, frustrating gameplay design, and a shockingly brief length left me wondering if I could really recommend it to someone else. But for all its faults I still enjoyed the experience, for reasons I find hard to put into words. There is just something inherently charming about all of it, and perhaps I wanted so much for its mechanics to succeed that I kept going despite my annoyances. I can\u2019t speak for others, but I suppose a lot of it harkens back to my love of bedtime stories in general, which no matter how lackluster they were I ate up with a ravenous desire for more.\n\nIn a lot of ways A Story About My Uncle left me feeling the same way as most of the stories I was told growing up; not entirely displeased with what I got, but saddened it had to end so soon.\n\n[b]Full disclosure: A Story About My Uncle was reviewed using a review copy provided by the developer. \n\nYou can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2014/05/28/a-story-about-my-uncle-review/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1401296115, "timestamp_updated": 1425334417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 113, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.842658877372741699", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17962297": {"recommendationid": "17962297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084253815", "num_games_owned": 643, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480025702}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] About [/h1]\n\tFirst off, a general point.

While you search for him, you discover that he has been studying things- things impossible in this world. Not only that, but you later find that he has a way into this mystical world. The Uncle has been studying this world for a long time, as is shown through the large collection of notebooks with extensive drawings on the creatures of this world, along with strange markings in the pages. Through his discoveries, you are able to take the passage into this world to try and track him down. While you search, you find clues and leftover inventions that he could not carry with him on his journey. These inventions are normally just fun new ways of getting from A to B. After a while, you discover a village filled with some kind of frog people, who praise The Uncle, and are very kind to you. They assist you in your quest to the best of their amphibious abilities. You traverse many obstacles and solve numerous puzzles to try and figure out where The Uncle might be, but you soon learn that nobody- not even the frog people- know where he is. After continuing your grueling search, you finally find him, and receive an explanation about why he left your world for this one, and why the frog people praise him- He was not simply a traveler that they deemed praiseworthy, he was in fact their creator, and even the creator of the entire world. After this explanation, you try to get The Uncle to come home with you- however, he decides to stay with his creations, instead of returning to his home. On this somber note, you leave him to his life, and return back to your home to tell of what transpired.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1] Personal opinion [/h1]\n\nI.\tLove. This. Game. I have already beaten it once in under 2 and a half hours, but I plan to go back and play it again, both for secrets I missed, and foreshadowing I might not have noticed my first time around. This game gripped me like a vice with its captivating visuals and wonderful story- I really want to see more games with this much creativity. This game has a lot of charm to it, a good bit of peace, and a *shocking* lack of any rage for a first person platformer- it's very fair and lenient compared to others of its genre. It's an overall tranquil experience, but it is not without suspense for what will happen next. If you are a person who enjoys richly atmospheric games over intense action, this is the perfect fit for you. My main gripe with this game is the price: $12.99 USD for a very short game is a bit steep. While the gameplay is fun and the story is rich, the experience was similar to eating a delicious slice of pie (or cake, but as we all know, the cake is farcical)- it is great while it lasts, but at the end, you feel like there was a lot more than what you were given, and you ache to have just a bit more. I hope my opinion has helped you decide whether or not to purchase this game. Final recommendation: If you are a story and parkour fan, pick it up whenever, but for others, wait until it goes on sale. When it goes on sale you have no excuse not to buy it. No excuse. None. I hope I helped you all on your decision about getting this game. I 100% recommend this game!!\n\n[h1] 9.5/10 [/h1]\n[i] Proofread by Frey Cloudseer [/i]\n\n[i] If you found this review helpful and want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation] Follow here![/url]", "timestamp_created": 1441837179, "timestamp_updated": 1480025861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 164, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.855555176734924316", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "41506313": {"recommendationid": "41506313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116100475", "num_games_owned": 2081, "num_reviews": 244, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1523814099}, "language": "english", "review": "A Story About My Uncle is a first person platforming adventure game about a boy who searches for his lost uncle, and ends up in a world he couldn\u2019t imagine existed.

For me the game was worth it, the experience was great, fun, and heartwarming. \nThe game would really benifit from a level editor to keep the game going with a lot of user created content, so here's hoping they add one.\n\n-FreakOrama\n\nMore info here: [url=http://ksalue.com/main/2014/05/a-story-about-my-uncle-review/]KSalue[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1401282433, "timestamp_updated": 1401288695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765953779220581055", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48276884": {"recommendationid": "48276884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132352418", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547235958}, "language": "english", "review": "---{Graphics}---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Paint.exe\n\n---{Gameplay}---\n\u2610 Addictive like heroin\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It\u2018s just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Staring at a wall is better\n\u2610 Just don\u2018t\n\n---{Audio}---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Earrape\n\n---{Audience}---\n\u2611 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2611 Average Solitaire players\n\n---{PC requirements}---\n\u2610 Check if you can run Paint\n\u2611 Runs on a potato (with very low graphics and you won't be at 60 FPS all the time)\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boiiiiii\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Difficulty}---\n\u2610 Just press \u201aA\u2018\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2611 Nothing to grind\n\u2611 Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks/achievements\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You\u2018ll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{Story}---\n\u2610 If you want a story, go read a book\n\u2610 Text or audio floating around\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It\u2018ll replace your life \n\n---{Game time}---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of tea\n\u2611 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Long (if your objective is to finish it at 100%)\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{Price}---\n\u2610 It\u2019s free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{Bugs}---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 [Insert famous buggy developer here]\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n[b]I stole this template from another guy xD[b]", "timestamp_created": 1547297441, "timestamp_updated": 1547552347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 261, "votes_funny": 165, "weighted_vote_score": "0.83268970251083374", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23188872": {"recommendationid": "23188872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074236917", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511764285}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the shortest games i've loved", "timestamp_created": 1464118664, "timestamp_updated": 1464118750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.796028673648834229", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15758013": {"recommendationid": "15758013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000824354", "num_games_owned": 1264, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446840047}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Intro & Summary[/h1]\nThis is one of those little hidden gems that nobody talks about because it's not incredibly new or unique, it's just very well done and good fun.

First off let's start with what most people come to see for the first time with this game, the graphics.\n\n[h1] The Graphics[/h1]\n\nThis game is nothing short of beautiful, for it to have been made over two years ago (as of the time this review is being made). The game has aged very well, some triple-a titles can't even look this wonderful, from the gorgeous lighting and shadows to the smooth physics and motion that you receive while grappling, but I'll talk more about the way the game works shortly. This is singlehandedly one of the prettiest indie games I've played and well worth the $5 that my friend spent on it in order to give it to me as a gift (Thank you Ryan c:). Even the landscapes and models are well detailed, from pieces of paper and bottles that you'll find laying around, to the beautiful skybox that inhabits the world, this is a masterpiece of an adventure. The only downfall is the character models, the (lizard?) people that you encounter seem to look a lil cartoonish and have strange ways of walking, it seems like the developers kinda skimped on them entirely, but not on the scenery, which I guess I can forgive since they made such a pretty game.\n\n[h1] Gameplay[/h1]\n\nNow this is one of the best parts of the game, in my opinion. The parkour elements and skills that you need in order to dodge and seemelssly jump from platform to platform, from ice spikes to landing pads, it's wonderful, really! The way that you run and grapple onto platforms isn't clunky or too difficult, the right amount of timing and luck will get you through the levels in no time at all. Overall the gameplay itself has a unique feel, if I could change anything I'd make the height of your character just a tad taller, you seem to be a lil too close to the ground when you're freerunning through caves.\n\n[h1] Story[/h1]\n\n[u] Okay this is the bread and butter for this game and there will be spoilers ahead so if you haven't beaten it yourself, stop here.[/u]\n\nThis game starts off so spooky and strange, the atmosphere is dark and omniscent and hell I'd even say it looked like a horror game if it had some depth of field, but it doesn't. You play as a man, telling his daughter a story of his Uncle and the adventure that he undertook in order to find him, and then return back home. During the story of this game you come along a girl by the name of Maddie, she rides on your back for a majority of the time that you'll actually be playing, and she helps you along the way by giving you hints and decoding the texts on the wall in order to reveal where you are and where you're going. The parkour elements that I discussed earlier really do set the stage for the adventurious feeling that this game gives off, you actually get immersed within this short story. As for the ending of the game, well the way that you find your uncle and then leave him within meer seconds of seeing him kinda disappointed me because you only said a few words to him, and then left. He didn't even thank you for finding him, he just left you on your marry way and he stayed behind in the chasm to live out his adventure. After the credits there is an epilogue and you find yourself walking through your uncle's abandoned home, explaining how the adventure you undertook meant a lot to you and your daughter and you are proud you could undertake such a journey in order to find your uncle and bring your soul serenity and peace from the worry of wondering what might have happened to your uncle if you never went after him. I'd be lying if I said I didn't tear up when you let go of the note/picture of you and your daughter and it flies up into the night sky, as you say thank you to your uncle for making all of this happen. \n\n[h1] Summary[/h1]\n\nThis story is wonderful, although short and sweet. If a game can make me cry, laugh, smile, and feel angry within a playthrough, I'll give it a solid review. And this game, well it did all of those including the first one, which is rare. Overall I'd say this game is a solid 10/10 and you should pick it up if you have the chance, you can find it on sale here and there or cheaper on some third party sites, but it's well worth it. It took me a little over 2 hours to complete the story, and it's a story I'd play again if given the chance.", "timestamp_created": 1463281391, "timestamp_updated": 1483569035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.740433335304260254", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35537409": {"recommendationid": "35537409", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973207923", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507362953}, "language": "english", "review": "Swing into a whimsical world narrated as a bedtime story about your missing Uncle Fred.

The game is quite short and it took me a little less than 6 hrs to complete it. The story is fairly simple and straightforward as the protagonist narrates a story to his daughter about a journey that he embarked on to find his beloved uncle's whereabouts when he was a kid. Coming to the gameplay, this is exactly the department where the game has something new to offer to the players. The core mechanics of the gameplay involves crossing various levels ranging from frozen caverns to paradisal floating city to mystical landscapes by means of a grappling hook. It can be quite frustrating at times to progress through some parts of almost every level given the challenging level designs. Timing and patience is, more often than not, the key to successfully cross those hurdles. Barring those, the gameplay is actually quite fun and somewhat makes you feel as if you're a superhero as you fly high and soar through the levels. The visual fidelity is quite decent. It is more of an artwork with good colour contrasts. The enigmatic and imaginary elements of the game world adds to the overall graphics quality as well. The ambience in-game was very good as it incorporates a sense of calmness and keeps you hooked to it throughout its entirety. The controls were quite responsive. Didn't have any problem in that regard as well. On the other hand, the achievements are tough to unlock in this game too. So a heads up for the achievement hunters out there. There's also a time trial mode where you've to complete the previously completed levels within a limited time.

There were standard caves, dark menacing caves with glowing plants, ice caves, caves of floating villages, and caves of artifacts from another time. All caves were enormous, big enough to contain a whole city and then some. \n\nThe art style leans toward cartoonish but fits quite well with the fantasy setting that requires a bit of suspension of disbelief (floating rocks, duh). \n\nThe sound and music were well-done and serve the mood of the game nicely. \n\nThe dialogue, though few, was quite decent and the voice-acting was excellent. \n\nAnd the mechanics are very polished and together the setting, the art style, the music, the sound, and the gameplay made up a very immersive experience. It is hard not to feel the pounding of your heart as you run, jump, grapple and slinghshot yourself through various terrain with incredible speed. The rush is there, but gravity never did forget you. I remember countless times where I miss the right timing to connect my grapple then look up as all rocks around me shoot up, the wind swoosh by. and everything fade to black.  \n\nThe bad:\n\nWhile the mechanics were quite good. There were definitely a few places in the game where I felt there could be more  cues as to what can be connected with the grapple. In one instance I was supposed to connect to the stalacites on the cave ceiling to swing myself across, but no sound or environmental cues were provided. And I felt frustrated as I tried to super-jump myself across but inevitably fell to my miserable death every time. At another time, there were these glowing crystals where the player is supposed to use in mid-air to charge the grappling hook and further the swinging distance, but for a quite a few of them no matter how close I get no charging was possilbe. And so I had to plan my route not using them. Note that these frusrating intances are far and few in between, and the developer are still releasing patches, so I remain hopeful that they will be fixed in due time.\n\nfinal words:\n\nIf you are looking for a neat game you can enjoy in an afternoon, and the idea of being Tarzan swinging in fantastical caves intrigues you, then consider \"A Story About My Uncle.\" It is an atomoshperic, narrative-driven experience that takes you away to a different world one swing at a time.", "timestamp_created": 1414388818, "timestamp_updated": 1414388818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.75841909646987915", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42033807": {"recommendationid": "42033807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049379938", "num_games_owned": 3158, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1526245351}, "language": "english", "review": "God bless Steam! I can\u2019t stop praising it for making it possible to make new cool connections and meet people around the world with common interests. These people always remind me about some games, that I had on my mind for a long time and then forgot. \n\nBut what is much more important is that games they recommend me always fit my mood in a proper way, just like in a right place in a right time. The same happened to me with A Story About My Uncle. I had a bit harsh weekend, which started with fixing my broken PC on Saturday, then I was forced to do other stuff I really didn\u2019t feel like doing and after all these events I felt like I squeezed lemon, so I really needed something chill, relaxing and just kind, without any violence. So, after a quick conversation with a friend on Steam, I realized, that I bought this game few years ago, I guess and still never touched.\n\nAnd that was a mistake! Or not? Maybe this game was waiting for a proper time and it only came now? Anyway, I always have this feeling, like, why I never played it earlier, when I find something really cool and amazing in my library all of a sudden. A Story About My Uncle starts as protagonist tells a little girl bedtime story, so she can fall asleep. He decides to tell her a story about a sudden disappearance of his uncle.\n\nYou come in your uncle\u2019s house and looking around for him. After climbing up on atticus, you ended up with finding a suit, that your uncle invented and you decided to wear it, like I don\u2019t know, for no reason, at all. I mean, that was a bit confusing for me, just don\u2019t get me wrong - you come into someone\u2019s place, looking for the master of the house, then you find a suit and you think like, oh let me try it, why not? :) Of course, I understand that it\u2019s a bedtime story for a little girl and you can\u2019t be so strict about it, but in terms of starting a story that part confused me a bit at the start.\n\nRight after you fit something that doesn\u2019t belong to you, an enormous atticus window opens and you teleport to a weird place with little flying islands. Your reaction is kinda like wow, oh my god, where am I now, what\u2019s going on here, but you are not gonna be overwhelmed for a long time. Just in a few seconds you will already understand somehow, that this suit is not just a fashionable suit, it has interesting abilities and of course, they come handy just in time. \n\nGame introduces you to a grappling hook on your glove, set on a LMB, which will be the most frequently usable gadget during your adventure. The trick is that you will have to travel from island to island, using that hook, grappling on stones located in the air between them. The more you proceed the more features of the suit will become available to you, like boosting yourself off the ground after holding and releasing the RMB button, or rocket boots, activated by pushing spacebar. As being a classic puzzle game, where you have to reach to your destination using all these features, all these suit powers will works in a best way ever when they are combined. For example, you have to sprint on the ground, holding the RMB button and then release it right near the edge, to boost yourself in the air, hook the nearest stone and then after realizing the next stone is quite far, spam a spacebar button to get to it. In addition to it, you will have a limited amount of hooks, so you won\u2019t be able to spam LMB hoping that you will catch a flying stone one way or another, sooner or later.\n\nAt some point, during your adventure, you will find a village with weird froggy-alike creatures, which will answer some of your questions and will help you, guiding your way to uncle and telling you about this world and its secrets. These creatures represent a really important part of this world and this charming story as well, you will understand it closer to the end of the game. \n\nThe good point, that you will not be stuck only somewhere high in the air, jumping around the clouds from one island to another. You will also be able to explore greeny villages, dangerous caves and icy terrains, as well, so you won\u2019t feel like you are stuck at one place. \n\nOf course, my favorite part of the game is the narrative thing. During your adventure, the protagonist will be explaining everything for the little girl, commenting on every dangerous situation or an item found in caves or whatsoever, that makes connection to the story and tells more about mysterious uncle disappearance in this fairy world. That, without a doubt, my favorite part in games, when developers work on the dialogues and telling you a story through the protagonist\u2019s lines. Little girl seems to be really confident and has a big mouth, so time to time you will uncontrollably smile on what she says. \n\nI can highly recommend this game to someone who is in love with short, touching, well-designed indie games with a soul and kind atmosphere, without any violence at all. It would be a cruel move from my side to call this game relaxing, because at some point it can be a bit challenging, and at the end of the game, on the last level there is a chance that you can smash your screen! But, in general, this game has a message in it, of course I won\u2019t tell you which one, because it\u2019s a massive spoiler, but it\u2019s hard to argue with a fact, that mixing action puzzle jumping-platformer game with a touching story is a really brave move, that worked out really well!\n\nOk, to sum everything up!\nYou should grab this game if you:\n\n+ Love nice charming games\n+ Eager to play something short and nice\n+ You love all these games with puzzles where you have to travel from one point to another, finding a best way to get from point A to point B\n+ Fan of an atmospheric games with warm graphics and beautiful sceneries\n+ The idea of adventure and travelling is your thing\n+ Love all these cool gadgets, with grapple hooks, super jumps, etc.\n\nRecommend to avoid if you:\n\n- Although, I said this game has warm graphic, it looks a bit outdated from technical point of view, especially the faces of froggy creatures\nEnjoy!\n\n[url=store.steampowered.com/curator/32013470/] Follow my curator's page if you enjoy my reviews and want to stay tuned!

Let's see.\n\nThe story starts with you, telling to your daughter a bedtime story about an adventure you've experienced as a child. Of course, you get to live the adventure.\nA kid of not specified age finds some sort of space suit into his uncle's closet. This suit looks just made for him. He then decide to wear it and place himself into a strange teleporter. This shoots him into another dimention, made of flying rocks that he can swing on with his special [strike] Spider-man web [/strike] magic glowie beam that he can shoot out of his [strike] Iron-man suit [/strike] glove.\n\nFirst thing you will notice about this game: the stunning environments. Each stage haves a different one, and they all looks very interesting. Well, maybe the last one won't be looking really cool, because it's just a ice mountain, but we'll get to the final part of the game. Oh boy, we will.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty decent, not the best quality you will find, but still enjoyable; same goes for the music, appealing, but not very memorable.\n\nThe gameplay works very well, M1 to shoot the beam that will drag you around, M2 to load up your super jump, and later on, spacebar while in the air for rocket boots (also, expect a dumb brony reference after you'll get them). The first person model animations are very well made, but the camera angle doesen't make me look like a little kid at all. And having an adult grunt when the character fall from a huge heigh doesen't help.\n\nBut here is something that bugged me a little: the level design. \nMuch more I was going on, much more it felt a little bit repetitive. Sure, the story was proceeding, but I didn't really been following that because was pretty clich\u00e9 and expecially they whould spoil you pretty much all the biggest twist with some question that the character made to himself. Is like that guy that while you watch a movie says \"oh, I bet now this is gonna happen\", and that actually happen. Is kinda frustrating.\nAnyway, about the level design, it wasn't only done pretty badly, but also there was no sense of progression. You can take the first stage and then pass to the last stage, the level of difficulty is pretty much the same. And expecially, [u] there could be way more  gameplay elements then the one we got. [/u]\nFor exemple, at one point there will be a giant monster. They could have added a way to actually fight it, but nope. We got Red Light-Green Light game. Great.\n\nAnd then the last problem with this game: [b] THE F*CKING RUSHED FINAL. [/b]\nIf there is something that I hate more, is the feeling of not have achieved something in the end. And this game passed that line.\nAfter a boring normal puzzle, you finally get to the ending. You will then take part of a scene (pretty much like Half Life 2, there is no actually cutscenes into the whole game) and then the game ends. There is no boss fight, no final time trial puzzle, nothing. Just a 2 minute stupid, [b] stupid [/b] dialog.\nWords cannot express how much I hate this kind of finals, and this really makes me even more angry, because I want to like this game.\n\nBut still, I would reccommend it. \n\n[h1]Final score: 6/10 [/h1]\n\nIt's fun, it has an interesting concept and the 3-4 hours long doesen't make it way too much boring.

(ASAMU)\n\n\nWhen I saw this game on the Steam frontpage it was love at first sight. Normally I wait for a discount, and then just tuck the games I find interesting in my backlog, but ASAMU was different: I bought it at full price, downloaded it and finished it in one sitting. Even though I throughoutly enjoyed the game, admired the visuals and find (most of) the story interesting I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this game, I'm not sure if I can even say that it's a good game. Third person platforming is one of my favorite game genres which is sadly neglected, ASAMU much like Mirror's Edge offers the thrill of leaping through huge depths, and the feeling of freedom (have you ever dreamt that you can fly? well it's a bit like that) Let me elaborate:\n\n1. Graphics:\n\nPros:\n+ Beautiful scenery and landscapes.\n+ True feeling of depth below you.\n+ Smart camera movement making the jumps and movement more immersive.\n+ Perfectly optimized, runs flawlessly on a mid-spec laptop maxed out.\n\nCons:\n- Low-res immersion-breaking character models.\n- Somewhat inconsistent art-style. \n- The visuals don't really support the story. \n\n2. Gameplay:\n\nPros:\n+ Interesting equipment upgrades like \"laser grappling hook\", \"rocket-boots\"\n+ Smart platforming puzzles. \n+ Constant sense of adrenaline-rush and challenge. \n+ Intuitive/easy to learn controls\n+ The lack of any violence, and death when falling makes the game unusually soothing and relaxing. \n\nCons:\n- Unintuitive checkpoint system where the distance between the chekpoints grow larger and larger.\n- The fast-paced gameplay slows down and stalls in the later levels.\n- Unfair difficulty spikes. \n- Trial-and error puzzles (you can't do it at one try, you should die 5-50 times before you figure out)\n- The hardcore precision-platforming requirements at places may scare away newcomers to the genre. \n- Short gameplay time (I finished it in around 6 hours in my slow-pace most people finish it in 2-3 hours) \n\n3. Story\n\nPros: \n+ Sort of interesting premise\n+ Interesting narrated gameplay (like Bastion), however it becomes inconsistent and scarce as the game progresses.\n\nCons:\n- Terrible, terrible ending (oh god why), I just stared at the screen feeling cheated. It would have been better to not have a story at all!\n- Uninteresting characters, clich\u00e9 dialogues. \n\n4. Music/Sound Design\n\n+ The music is cool, but nothing to write home about.\n+ The sound design gets the job done, nothing impressive either. \n\nVerdict:\n\nIf I'd be objective I'd give ASAMU a score of 60/100. It was sort of a financial flop, and not a commercial success either (according to Steamcharts 166 players played it the most, currently has 2 players active).  It has an interesting concept but sadly it falls short in delivering, the story feels terribly rushed (like they wrote it 20 minutes before released) the gameplay although fun has it's flaws which combined with the story (in a supposedly story-rich game) just can't make it.  \n\nHowever I still recommend it, why?\n\nBecause I can't say that I didn't enjoy the game, I mean I finished it in one sitting that's something right?

The best way I can describe this game is imagine Mirrors Edge without the parkour element and you got up to the high places using a grappling hook.\n\nIn general this game is rather simple and is easy to learn, so you pick up really fast and you have a ton of fun playing it. \n\nYou swing from place to place to get to Uncle Fred and you visit some really breathtaking locations. I mean a lot of these locations look amazing like the Ice Caverns, the windmill land and the other locations as well.\n\nGraphically the game looks great, some of the locations look breathtaking and are amazing to look at, but this however can't be said about character models.  A lot of them look really ugly, but you only see live creatures for fraction of minutes so it doesn't really annoy me that much.\n\nGame is around 3 hours long, but it has some replay value like a timed mode and collectibles, which would make the game around 5 hours long or even longer. I paid a single euro for it and I definitely had an amazing time playing this game. \n\nA Story About My uncle is an incredibly fun game.

I found the story to be mysterious, and the art style to be one of my favorite. The voice acting wasn't anything amazing, but it wasn't terrible. It's definitely one of the games you have to pretend you are in the shoes of the main character. This game is pretty easy for the most part, but there are some tricky spots. I really enjoyed this game, but I do believe that it is overpriced.

Don't buy this.\n\nDid you like the grappling in Batman: Arkham Asylum and wish somebody would make a full game out of it? Buy this.\n\n---\n\nPROS:\n\n- Really good graphics.\n- Fun easter eggs, a lot of neat nods to Goat Simulator (another game by these devs).\n- Fun mechanics when the devs actually decide to use them.\n- Being short, it's a great timewaster for the afternoon.\n- Collectibles, albeit 25 of them total.\n- There is SOME story, although I found most of the characters unlikeable and the sense of \"purpose\" to be all ove rthe place. In this game, your goal is to find your uncle, who got lost in some alternate dimension(?). [spoiler]You find him, you talk for about a minute, and then he sends you home and you never see him again.[/spoiler]\n- The sound design is top-notch, except for the voice acting. It can really do without all that.\n\nCONS:\n- Puzzles are too obvious, you're in for one of those \"follow the shiny markers\" Q.U.B.E. type adventures.\n- Mechanics sometimes just don't work. God forbid you click too fast.\n- Items come and go. You'll see game reviews say things overstay their welcome, but this game does the exact opposite. Hell, [spoiler]one part rewards you by giving back an item they took away for no reason.[/spoiler]\n- I seriously hate the characters in this game, all of them are either annoying or not very smart.\n- Just when you think you might like this game, it ends. It's only about 2 and half hours of gameplay if you don't plan to 100% it, not worth the price.\n- Unlockables just step on top of eachother. [spoiler]You get to change your laser color, and then it doesn't matter because it's replaced with a goat tongue.[/spoiler]\n- This game explains nothing. I don't know where I am, I don't know what anything is, I don't understand the logic of this world. There's no lore, and no expansions that might explain the lore.\n- I still don't know what the hell that skeleton wants.\n- While all-around a pretty decent game, minor negatives add up and ruin the experience for me. Is it bad? No. Would I recommend it? Only if you REALLY wanna play it.\n\nThis game has been haunting me for weeks now. I don't think I like it, but it was good enough for me to go ahead and finish it. If it's on sale or free again, go ahead and try it, I guess. This isn't Might No. 9 \"dear god WHY\" bad, this is just \"clearly an indie game that bit off a bit more than it could chew\" mediocre. I'm voting \"no\" becuase I wouldn't play it again, but clearly a lot of people enjoy this game for the pros I listed.

A Story About My Uncle is a fine example of a casual, yet challenging platformer experience filled with beautiful environments.  \n\n[b]Story:[/b]\nA Story About My Uncle involves the story of a boy, most likely a teenager, who is alone in his uncles cabin surrounded by tundra. The game starts as the boy recalls a story about his uncle and the interesting life he led. As you play through the experience you slowly end up living a wonderful adventure of your own while learning about the amazing world your uncle has created.  As you explore through caverns and floating islands you meet interesting characters who help piece together the gaps within your uncle\u2019s life while forming your own story.\n\n[b]Campaign:[/b]\nOverall the campaign is a decent length, you\u2019ll probably get anywhere from four (4) to eight (8) hours of gameplay out of this. If you want to find every secret you probably could spent a significant amount of additional time playing the game. The campaign offers a variety of different environments, but ultimately it is relatively repetitive. You\u2019ll go through caves, some floating islands, then caves with floating islands.\nThe achievements act as challenges for this game rather than progression points, so despite the game essentially just being the campaign you could go back and play the levels as challenges to get the achievements, but realistically this has no impact on the actual game itself. \nThe campaign is relatively easy, which perfectly suits the design and style of this game. You may die a couple times as you go through, but the smooth checkpoint placement and relatively simple puzzles make this game fun rather than annoying. \n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nAs platformer FPS style games go this one is pretty good with the controls and hit boxes. You\u2019ll find yourself rarely thinking that you should have landed somewhere you didn\u2019t or hit something you would have missed. As the game is an FPS you don\u2019t have to deal with poor camera elements as you could see in an third person platformer, but with this same light you\u2019ll also find you may need to have your sensitivity up high if you need to make a quick turn-around. \nThe game plays off you having a power suit that adds functions throughout the game, but honestly you\u2019ll find that you essentially only unlock three abilities and they are all pretty basic. You\u2019ll get the ability to jump higher, the ability to propel forward, and a grappling hook. You\u2019ll essentially be using the same abilities throughout the game to solve relatively similar puzzles. \n\n[b]Results:[/b]\nI\u2019d recommend A Story About My Uncle for anyone looking for a relatively casual, yet immersive experience. The gameplay is somewhat similar to mirrors edge in that you will be running and jumping, but focuses more on utilizing your power suits special abilities to propel yourself through puzzles and into unique places. I personally grabbed this game when it was 75% off, and would recommend doing the same; but, if you absolutely love platformer fps then this is the game for you and you might as well pay full price. \n\nPros:\n+Decent graphics and visuals\n+Relaxing soundtrack\n+Good story\n+Platformer FPS with some puzzle elements\n+Good check point distance (making dying less annoying)\n+Decent length\n\nCons:\n-Relatively repetitive gameplay style\n-Repeating environments", "timestamp_created": 1476550663, "timestamp_updated": 1476550663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.671363592147827148", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10269018": {"recommendationid": "10269018", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997720748", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498354122}, "language": "english", "review": "A Story About My Uncle, pros & cons.\n\nPros :\n- Amazing graphics!\n- Great movement system, all aspects of grappling, boosting just work so well!\n- A very peaceful game, something to relax.\n- Amazing ebb & flow.\n\nCons :\n- A very short game for 12\u20ac\n- Rushed story\n- Lack of interaction with village characters (I think it would add some spice to the game)\n- A companion who spams you with \"Hey!

By taking on the role of this nephew, it is up to you to find Uncle Fred's unknown whereabouts.\n\n[h1]\ud83c\udfae [u]G\u1d00\u1d0d\u1d07\u1d18\u029f\u1d00\u028f[/u] \ud83c\udfae[/h1]\nAt the beginning of the game, you are given a grappling suit that gives you the power to jump incredibly high and leap across extreme distances. This suit allows the wearer to harness the power of a crystal \ud83d\udc8e, which emits a beam that acts as \"sticky\" rope, allowing for extreme mobility to climb and swing with ease through the environment. Equipped with this ability, you are able to grapple many surfaces and swing freely from platform to platform in a first-person perspective. However, the length of the beam is limited, and the number of times you can you use the grappling beam is also limited until you touch the ground again. Therefore, this can deem as quite the challenge when going through difficult and complex environments. The player will be required to have precision and fast reflexes to effectively traverse across the world.\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udd8c\ufe0f [u]G\u0280\u1d00\u1d18\u029c\u026a\u1d04s \u1d00\u0274\u1d05 D\u1d07s\u026a\u0262\u0274[/u] \ud83d\udd8c\ufe0f[/h1]\nThe levels are made up of five worlds, each decently increasing in difficulty. Each level will introduce a new mechanic that is fairly easy to learn and put into practice. The worlds are all magnificently crafted, featuring areas such as lush, canopy-like jungle, a dark, ominous cavern, or absolutely beautiful clusters of floating islands in the sky. \u2601\ufe0f\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=352491847\n[h1]\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb [u]W\u029c\u1d00\u1d1b I E\u0274\u1d0a\u1d0f\u028f\u1d07\u1d05[/u] \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb[/h1]\nEach environment of the worlds in [b]A Story About My Uncle[/b] certainly holds the aspect of quality over quantity. While there are only five worlds to go through, each one had me bedazzled at how attractive they were. Although being quite linear, the game will give you some opportunity to explore these worlds, by hiding collectibles and different interactable objects that will tell you more about the characters' backstory \ud83c\udfd5\ufe0f. Finding the secret collectibles will also [spoiler] unlock some bonus perks for your suit and grappling beam, which I definitely had fun playing around with[/spoiler]. There are some additional achievement challenges for each area that will give the game some replayability for those hardcore players.   \n\n[h1]\ud83d\udcdd[u]M\u028f C\u1d0f\u0274\u1d04\u029f\u1d1cs\u026a\u1d0f\u0274[/u] \ud83d\udcdd[/h1]\nWhen I played the 2008 first-person parkour game, [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror%27s_Edge]Mirror's Edge[/url], I would often wonder what it would be like to jump and swing about the City of Glass using a Spiderman-like web mechanic. [b]A Story About My Uncle[/b] was able to bring this past concept to life for me \ud83d\udc93 (minus the parkour element of course).

[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is a first person platformer, a genre which until this game, I insisted could never measure up to its far superior third person cousin. Surprisingly though, the tight handling and impeccable accuracy in this game was enough to rival and even surpass that of most third person games with ease.\n\nWhile the gameplay is amazing and is enough to support the game on its own, the amount of gameplay the game consists of isn't so great. The story is rather brief after my experience playing it. Moreover, the models' graphics seemed pretty low end, however the environment was astoundingly beautiful. Consequently, the game did work extremely well with what it had. While the graphics might have been below AAA quality the environments were amazingly done and the creatures were unique and imaginative. I can only imagine what the developers could have done with a bigger budget. The soundtrack really helps complete the atmosphere too. I\u2019ll admit that there was one point that genuinely had me shitting myself. Now if that doesn\u2019t speak wonders for a game's atmosphere than I don\u2019t know what does.\n\n[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is an amazing and completely unique experience. There is only one big problem with the game and that is the length. While the gameplay and world is perfect I just don\u2019t know if I could justify buying a three hour long game for the price it is at the moment. The game was easily good enough to have been much longer without wearing out it\u2019s welcome and I was genuinely disappointed that it ended so quickly. If you can stomach the price then I would completely recommend it and if it\u2019s ever on sale then seriously, waste no time! Get it played!\n\nSo, to sum it all up thus far...\n\n[u]Pros[/u]\n\n--Amazing story\n--Alluring environments\n--Great animations\n--Challenging puzzles\n--Intreguing characters\n--Can take some splendid screenshots\n\n[u]Cons[/u]\n\n--Poorly made models, especially the character models\n~~~~Does not correspond with environment\n--A rather brief story\n--Almost too simple\n--Relationships don't seem to last\n\n\nAll in all, I'd rate it 7.5-8/10", "timestamp_created": 1433725592, "timestamp_updated": 1433725748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628421008586883545", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26121671": {"recommendationid": "26121671", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279621511", "num_games_owned": 516, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479997323}, "language": "english", "review": "As weird as it may sound, first off,\n[h1] Do NOT judge the game by its name.
