It's pretty much what you'd expect, a war shooter. It's like Capture the Flag pretty much.\n\nIt's a simple game, the only problem I really have with it is the recoil is actually really horrible. If you shoot any machine gun, your head will jolt up. It gets super annoying and it makes aiming your gun close to impossible. It really screws up most of the game with machine guns so I usually stick to rifles and snipers and stuff. I also have a problem with just the sniper rifle because it takes afew seconds before you can actually aim the gun.\n\nOther than the recoil, I do have some problems with some of the maps, in some of the maps, there is a way to glitch to the inside of the other team's base. It is in a few maps so I really can't say them all. It is all over the place with glitches here, but atleast this game is sold for a good, and cheap price. Other than all this, I really enjoy Day of Defeat, it's not really a game I'd play all the time, that and the fact that nobody really plays this game anymore. Luckily, I found a server with 15+ people, so this is how I'm writing this review for you right now. Anyway, lets get to the final score!\n\nFinal score: 75%\n\nI've taken off 25% for 2 things, nobody really plays anymore, and the god awful recoil. I've taken most points off from the recoil especially, because nobody plays a game anymore isn't too much of a big deal. I'd recommend you to move to Day of Defeat: Source if you want to play with more than 1 person.

Rook was shadowing him, double checking each spot that Johannson had checked before. I was in the middle with Peters and his trusty sniper rifle, carrying the M2 Browning. And Stewart was in the rear, covering our backs with his Thompson at the ready.\n\nThe others had been glancing uncertainly at the MG I held in my hands, but I quickly dismissed the growing fear as they were undoubtly only nervous about a rookie with such a powerful weapon.\n\nIt was quiet. Too quiet.\n\nThe bridge we had set out to capture was undefended, and we quickly set up a defensive position in case a German patrol stumbled upon us.\n\nThe sound started as a low rumble. We looked around, at each other, confused as to why the ground was shaking. It got louder, and we could soon hear the sound of people yelling. We readied our weapons, getting ready for the enemy to throw a grenade or fire a Panzerschreck.\n\nBut nothing could prepare us for what happened next.\n\nA giant tide of German soldiers, all carrying trench shovels and primed Steilhandgranates in their hands, came around the corner, rushing at us screaming at the top of their lungs.\n\nWe opened fire, but there were too many and we were quickly overrun.\n\nStewart was the first to go, having gotten overzealous with his Thompson. He had managed to push the wave of Germans back, when they surrounded him and began pummeling him to death with their shovels. \n\nOne of them, holding a grenade, charged Rook and Johannson from behind. They never saw it coming.\n\nBy now, it was only me and Peters, him firing his sniper rifle with reckless abandon.  Running out of ammo, Peters quickly pulled out his M1911 and managed to squeeze off a few shots, but it wasn't long before he too was buried under the mass of grey and black.\n\nI was cornered, MG propped up against an overturned cart while I mowed down soldier after soldier, spent casings flying everywhere.  From out of nowhere, a fist collided with my face and I blacked out.\n\nWaking up, I found I was tied down to a chair in a pitch black room.

I love both of these games to death, but the similarities are few and far between. Obviously source has better graphics, but the maps and communities are nearly polar opposites. \n\nDay of Defeat is much harder than its Source counterpart. Mainly because of the source engine itself. DoD has a very weird sense of physics. So weird in fact, it's hard to explain. Your weapons are widely inaccurate when you're moving in nearly any form (which is expected) but the time it takes to stop moving is hard to get used to. Jumping feels right, sprinting feels good, but they're both limited by a short energy bar. I have no problem with this whatsoever- it makes sense to me that they'd put a lot of realism into that. \n\nThe gunplay is, for lack of a better word, nice. The guns aren't pretty by any stretch, but this is an old game, stop complaining about it. They aren't hard to handle like Counter Strike, but they feel real. Killing an enemy takes a lot of effort, but gunfights are ended quickly because of how damn powerful your weapons are. In a military shooter like this one, that feeling is essential. I don't wanna feel like I'm walking around weilding nothing more powerful than a squirt gun with hot sauce in it.\n\nThe popularity of this game has sparadically decreased since its release, but thats expected. Whereas most people have moved on to Source, there's still very much a community that thrives here. Most of them for the nostalgia, but a good part of them have joined because they're looking for something new. Veterans here are very common (not war veterans, guys.) and you could tell that this was a piece of their childhood. I'm being serious. Some of these guys joined steam way back when it was made. Are they good at the game? Oh my god. I'm lucky that I walked out of spawn sometimes.\n\nWhat's my personal verdict?\nI feel like this is a relic. Something everybody should experience at some point in time. That's not that ridiculous- especially considering this game is so cheap off-sale anyway. It's hard to get the hang of, but damn do you ever feel good afterwards. Sadly, though, at the end of the day I do prefer the Source version. I hold both of these close to my heart as milestones of my slow transition into PC gaming.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1521343784, "timestamp_updated": 1521343784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.793631255626678467", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38024573": {"recommendationid": "38024573", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999384006", "num_games_owned": 578, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 333542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19042, "last_played": 1551875757}, "language": "english", "review": "Underrated game with reliable game mechanics.

A lot of the players are non-Steam, so the charts are only correct for the Steam users. It's a WW2 shooter with realism. It is very hard to get into this game since it has a big learning curve and pretty much everyone is extremely good. Most of the maps are very well made and balanced. There are a few narrow maps which are a slaughterhouse if there are too many players though. I believe that there are things you should know before playing this game, so here are a few words of advice: \n\n- Grenades are very powerful\n- Grenades are detonated quicker if you pull the pin and do not throw it for a while \n- Most Grenadier and Sniper shots will be a one shot kill \n- In narrow maps it will be very frustrating, so play on larger maps first \n- Automatic weapons have recoil which is very hard to handle, so take your time to learn the basics of each weapon \n- Constantly check the map to see if you have teammates around, so you know if it's safe to push \n- You will die. A LOT.\n\nThat's pretty much it. Things like spots, weapons, maps and tricks you will learn along the way of playing it. First few hours will be very frustrating, especially for someone who hasn't played realistic shooters, but you will find yourself scoring more and more kills over time and it will be very satisfying.
