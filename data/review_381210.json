But....sadly its lost that fun element to it due to the developers not really caring about fixing the problems in this game.

Whether its the dodgy hit boxes that sometimes feel like they're the size of the map or there are people who take advantage of exploits like the r exploit where you spam r to drop a survivor when someone tries to blind to you to avoid getting the save. The new medium vaults have their own problems where the killer should obviously get the hit but dont due to this new vaulting system. If you asked me now if i would suggest buying this game, i would say a solid no, the game is too buggy to be fun and most people are either really sweaty/toxic or super immersed.

This game has an extremely high skill cap, and not being skilled at it will yield an annoying experience as you'll go down a lot as survivor, or not get kills often as killer. With that said, here it goes.\n\nFirst I've met one of my best friends through this game as well as countless other good friends I still talk to and I wouldn't trade that for anything. This game has yielded great experiences, from when I first played survivor, crouching around the map, to recent days of running from and messing with the killer. I should say I play killer/survivor with a 50/50 split, I've achieved rank 1  with killer and survivor multiple times, but you're most memorable times will probably come from playing survivor. Anyways this game has been a blast, a truly fun experience learning how to run from the killer, or learning how to mind-game survivors AS the killer. With a decent Twitch community behind it, there's always something new to watch or learn about the game. But I can't in good faith recommend this game and it really hurts to say that.\n\nThe main problem with this game is you aren't rewarded for ranking up, there are no rewards for your work, you're actually penalized. As you rank up this game becomes much more toxic. Survivors and killers both because of their high rank will feel entitled to the win. Survivors will t-bag and troll you, and make sure you know in post-game chat their opinion of whether you should be toaster-bathing yourself or not. And if you become a good survivor, it makes a lot of killers mad. \"Oh you ran me for 3 gens, that's an automatic facecamp\" (facecamp is when the killer hooks the survivor and doesn't leave them to make SURE they die) and yes that's an actual quote said to me. Which makes you de-pip (partial de-rank). Which is another thing, the ranks.\n\nEvery game is ranked whether you like it or not and if ranking up is your main goal prepare to be disappointed. If the killer disconnects you de-pip. Load in the game and one of the survivors didn't load in and its a 1v3? Probably a de-pip. Made the killer mad somehow and now he's facecamping you? De-pip. Double-pip is extremely hard nowadays. You have to do pretty much everything to do so, so most games will be just a normal pip. But that game where you pipped that took 20 minutes, well next game you got found first and hooked and as soon as you were unhooked the killer tunnels you immediately and downs and hooks you again, so back down your rank goes. Rinse and repeat. I guess what i'm trying to say each game is a coin flip of it'll be a toxic waste of time, or an actual enjoyable game.\n\nThe MAIN problem in this game is one you won't face unless you get to rank 1, which is that at the core of the game survivors control the game and are much stronger than the killer. The time it takes to down one good survivor, 3 or 4 gens will be done, and extend that time depending on if they have decisive strike or not, which essentially is a get out of jail free card. But like i said, that's only with good, optimal-playing survivors. So now that I've talked about the game play let's talk about the stability of the game, and it's developers.\n\nBad. Real bad. Constant survivor DC's when game starts, loading screens getting stuck, you name it. And every time the game fails to load you lose your offering. That's right. Even if you don't actually load in the game, your offering still gets used up. Sucks for you I guess! Also I don't exaggerate when I say with every patch or DLC release a slew of bugs come with it. I don't know whats up with this game's code, but every time they tweak something it opens the flood gates to bugs. The devs hardly seem to listen as well. People have been asking to buff Freddy since he was released, still nothing. People have been complaining about Decisive strike being too strong, nothing. They said those 2 things are both in the works, but does it really take over a year to hear your loyal players out? \n\nI guess they have their development road map is top dog , and well-thought out criticism can take a back seat. One time when the game's lead designer was asked in a QnA about what to do when killer gets too frustrating because it's so stacked against the killer at times, making it literally impossible to win, he said to go play Civ 5. I'm not kidding. The devs just see us as crying kids, not happy that the game isn't perfect, but we don't want it perfect, we've played the hell out of it, we love it, we want it to be better and it could be. And it's a shame it isn't because I love this game. But it's a buggy, unbalanced, unrewarding grind (which is another topic by itself, i'm talking 300 hours or so to get all the perks on everyone WITHOUT prestiging) and it's just not worth it. I don't regret the time I put into this game, but it's not something I can recommend. I know the market is a bit short of multiplayer horror games, but this is less horror and more a game of toxic, bug-ridden tag. It hurts to say, but don't waste your time.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1549418935, "timestamp_updated": 1549418935, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.64873892068862915", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48956730": {"recommendationid": "48956730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043566460", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 11243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 136, "last_played": 1551759110}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a plethora of issues.

Any bugs or issues (and there have been plenty) are not addressed in a timely manner and are often put to the side while skins and cosmetics are released instead. there are many balancing issued with killer vs survivors and perks being unbalanced, and some killers are so underpowered at the moment they're barely being played as of late. If you're looking for casual play there's not much for you in that department either, there is a rank system that is in place that promotes people playing toxic and sweaty as if it were the olympics, so unless you have 4 other friends and want to play in the \"kill your friends\", that's what you have to deal with.

We use these because - bar some mediocre choices - everything else is bad. There are some perks that you never encounter. Do some more balancing, devs. I want to see a serious meta shake-up. It would pump even more life into this game.\n[*]An overall subpar matchmaking experience. Sometimes I spend 10 minutes with connecting to lobbies, leaving lobbies and backing out to the menu, rinse and repeat. Why? After joining a lobby I either find out that I got connected to a host where I have an unacceptable high ping (150-300) or the host is fine but 30 seconds later they decide to disconnect because they don\u2019t like the 4 Survivors\u2019 picks or their pings.\n[*]Graphics and performance. OK, it\u2019s a 3 year old game, but it's running on Unreal Engine which is a pretty nicely scalable and upgradable engine. The overall performance of this game is just clunky and the textures look washed out on some objects. Some textures look like someone put their fingers into paint and tapped all over the place.\n[*]Offering burns when the match begins to load, but it does not start in the end, or ends immediately and puts you back into the menu. Completely broken mechanic. Your offering should be kept if you didn\u2019t get the chance to control your character, simple as that.\n[*]Skill Check UI is choppy. Strangely, it starts off being choppy but if you run the game for a prolonged time (1-2 hours) it gets smoother and smoother. It's weird.\n[*]Some low detail cosmetics, especially the hairs. Ok this is a weird one. I inspect the cosmetic in the store. It has no issues, it's alright, it looks good. I buy and equip it. I go into a match with it and when I see it up close it looks weird, low detail, different than what is shown in the store.\n[*]Killer lobbies sometimes getting stuck and are removed from the search pool when 1 Survivor backs out.\n[*]P2P system causing a lot of desyncs with stable connection, even after all the fixes. We\u2019re supposed to get dedicated servers this summer so we\u2019ll see how that turns out.\n[*]Players crashing out before the match loads in, match starts with less than 4 Survivors. This messes up the match for everyone. I don't care that we have to repair a reduced amount of generators. A match that is not full should be ended right away with no scoring. Nobody wants to de-PiP/de-rank just because someone crashed or failed to connect.\n[/list]\n[b]Survivor[/b]\n[*]Wiggle does not give score and there is not enough distance between your downed spot and the closest hook to finish the wiggle bar. It causes little to no disturbance. Does not matter how precisely, how fast, how consistent you are, if you don't have Decisive Strike, Boil Over or a couple of Survivors delaying the Killer, then it won't do anything. The reason to do it is to prevent the Killer from carrying you all the way to the basement. It's a very badly designed keyboard mashing feature which isn't there to help you, but to annoy you. More annoyance to the Survivor than to the Killer tbh.\n[*]Getting hit when already vaulted over: especially after patch 2.5 in which the devs specifically pointed out that Survivors now have a momentum when vaulting\u2026 after the patch, they still get hit! Sure, Killers have a reach with their attacks, but when you are over the window, and you even took 1 or 2 steps, you should not get hit. It's ridiculous.\n[*]Getting hit AFTER pallet-stunning the Killer. Yes, it does happen. You stun the Killer but somehow the hit they were preparing finishes and goes through WHILE they just got stunned.\n[*]Spawning (almost) next to the Killer: Maps are small enough making it hard to avoid & hide from the Killer, but the fact that sometimes 1 second after map start the Killer is right next to you is simply unfair.\n[*]I feel like there are way too many aura detection perks for the Killers. Worst part of it is that you don't know if the Killer has one active until they surprisingly find you. You think you are well hidden at your spot and the Killer just comes right at you. This is confusing at first, because even if the Killer is zoning in on you, you don't really expect them to have a detection perk. You suppose  that it's just the Killer's patrol route, but no, they know where you are and you get hit. I'm pretty sure a lot of Survivors feel the same way.\n[*]Your teammates killing themselves on the hook. First occasion when they get hooked they go ahead and try to unhook themselves, then refuse to struggle. This is one form of rage quit and team-ruining.\n[/list]\n[b]Killer[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Endless loops/juke sections. There are places, such as shacks and big roundabout spots where you can't get enough momentum to deliver a hit, because there's either a vault window or a long wall. If you spend more than 10 seconds there, you are hindering yourself and giving the Survivors a lot of free repair time. It's difficult to remember to never get into a loop, because the game makes you think that you will be able to catch the Survivor. Just keep it in mind: don't get pulled into this kind of loop. Leave the teabagger alone, let him keep spamming the crouch, go find another target.\n[*]In all seriousness, I think as a Survivor it's more alarming to disturb the crows than utilizing them as a Killer. Can you remember when was the last time you found a Survivor because of the crows? I bet you can't. I'm sure though that you are upset about disturbing them as a Survivor, every match. Right? Haven't tried Spies from the Shadows perk yet, so maybe it's my bad.\n[*]It's often difficult to follow scratch marks, even when you chase a single Survivor. Scratch marks are so scattered all over the place that you kinda get confused about them. I don't think that forcing the Killer to equip the Predator perk is a good way to solve this. If you are a veteran player you might still end up going the wrong way when following a scratch mark trail. The Survivor didn't do a slalom and you aren't a bad player, it's just confusing, that's all.\n[/list]\n[b]Community[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Toxic player base. I really mean that. Even more toxic than any other. Combine the toxicity of every toxic game on the planet and multiply it by 3. The reason is because this game has 2 types mixed together: the communicated toxicity (written or said), or the in-game behavior toxicity (tea bagging, head shaking, team-ruining, etc). There are too many ways to heavily hurt someone's match experience, either being a Killer or Survivor. If you thought you are a calm, reasonable, friendly player, think twice, because I can guarantee that this game will mess you up.\n[*]Rage quitters ruining the whole match for everyone. Survivors get hit once, downed once or hooked once and they rage quit. One generator repair done, boom, Killer rage quits. Hex totem cleansed, boom, Killer rage quits. So on and so forth. Get over it people, it\u2019s a game. Every player's goal is the beat the opponent, that means everyone will have losses too, not just wins.\n[*]Tunneling/Camping Killers. The fact that a Killer can camp the hook and tunnel the same player and still get a PiP out of the whole match is simply ridiculous. Some sort mechanic should be implemented, that could cause camping Killers feel the urge to do something proactive. Devs are OK with tunneling and camping, since they don't accept complaints in this matter. The community on the other hand, despise campers and tunnelers. Something needs to happen to alleviate this.[/list]\nEOF", "timestamp_created": 1550969393, "timestamp_updated": 1550973202, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617966115474700928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48901347": {"recommendationid": "48901347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104867348", "num_games_owned": 418, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 27581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 286, "last_played": 1551739526}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoy this game despite some of it's flaws and issues.

After the first few times you play it, the scare factor is gone and you're left with playing hide and seek with the killer which is fine with me because it is an aspect that i feel DBD got right.

Some maps give survivors more advantages while others give them to the killer. You can always pick an offering to increase your luck or to choose your favourite map, etc. You do need some experience to play it right though. The graphics look great as well. The game play is easy to pick up.. it's just a fun game with friends. I have met some great people on this game and I've enjoyed playing in groups and cooperating together to escape. It's no fun when you're being tunnelled constantly but sadly that's how some people play. It can get intense trying to stay alive but you will die more than you will survive. Facts. At times you will think it is unfair and even unbalanced but gradually with each level of experience you learn to move into a situation where you have the skill to evade against the killer. It gets more competitive as you rank up but the excitement to escape is the fun that this game promises you. Playing the killer is loads of fun too but you'll get lots of toxic people whining about the way you play as well even if you're playing fair; people just love to complain. \n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nThe main theme is bangin' too... >:O\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1550035348, "timestamp_updated": 1550035348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603755772113800049", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48923113": {"recommendationid": "48923113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055936523", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 87279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4170, "last_played": 1551811603}, "language": "english", "review": "3/5 game.

I would be okay with this if the killers weren't locked behind microtransactions and they actually planned on fixing this obvious balancing issue, but instead, they keep it in the game as motivation for people to spend more money on the game. They can justify this because you can technically still get these killers without spending money by spending 9000 iridescent shards on a certain day to get the killer you want.

At this rate it would take me 101 hours to get enough for one killer not taking into account the increasing amount of xp you need to level up to get iridescent shards. microtransactions of this calibre are fine on like a free mobile game, but when they're in a game that's already $22 to begin with, i get pretty pissed.", "timestamp_created": 1549918726, "timestamp_updated": 1550023113, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49276397": {"recommendationid": "49276397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346316194", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 895, "last_played": 1551686459}, "language": "english", "review": "i used to enjoy this game a lot. really loved playing it with my friends. plenty of jumpscare opportunities and general adrenaline rush inducing content. however lately every killer we are paired with uses \"hex: ruin\" which at a high level makes the game almost unplayable. even when i play killer i am constantly body blocked and farmed for points by survivors. game: okay. player base: toxic. wouldn't recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1551351669, "timestamp_updated": 1551351669, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49043619": {"recommendationid": "49043619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203526272", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 970, "last_played": 1551834403}, "language": "english", "review": "the perfect balance of euphoria and depression", "timestamp_created": 1550372177, "timestamp_updated": 1550372177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49003646": {"recommendationid": "49003646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047001429", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550134486}, "language": "english", "review": "Do not buy this game, please do not support these developers.\n\nWith the recent announcement of a nintendo switch port of Dead by Daylight, I've lost all hope I had for already terrible developers. The game already runs like absolute **** on its existing console ports and could use much more dev work on every platform. This is appalling behaviour. Here's a taste of how incompetent these devs are:\n\n-Hitboxes for killers have been broken for years.\n\n-Players can disconnect from games as many times as they want with absolutely no punishment. This also leads to people deranking by disconnecting intentionally and ruining hundreds of games for others with no consequences. A game with built-in smurphing, just what I've always wanted.\n\n-There is no (or barely any) filter for matchmaking based on ping. Enjoy queuing and re-queuing for 10+ minutes until you finally find a lobby that isn't 300 ping.\n\n-There are excessively powerful and game ruining items and offerings that you can bring into games. Here's a fun one: usually your third time being put on the hook will kill you, but with the 'ebony mori' offering, the killer has the ability to straight up kill and remove people from the game after they've only been hooked once! For an idea of how the devs balance things, it used to be that you could just straight up kill people without even hooking them, but it was changed to this much tamer, \"better\" version. Laughable.\n\n-If you queue with friends, you must manually reinvite them back to your lobby after each game you play. Here's the kicker: you must leave the separate lobbies it puts you back into after the match, because you are no longer able to invite people in that lobby after queuing once as a group. You must start a new lobby. What? This is the easiest change ever to make to the game and has been requested since the beginning of the game. Still not fixed.\n\n-The developers mislead and lie to their players. With the recent reveal of the newest DLC killer, The Legion, it was implied that you would be able to play as any of the 4 members of the killer band. Nope! Welcome to Dead by Daylight DLC matroska dolls, where you must pay for 2 of the killers in the group if you've already bought the killer! What? They're just cosmetic changes, but they look much nicer than the 2 designs you get by default. How lovely.\n\n-The in-game progression system is awful. You use 'bloodpoints' you gather from playing games to unlock perks that you can use with your characters. That doesn't sound too bad but when most of the perks that are good are gated behind having another one of your characters at near max level, it quickly turns into korean-rpg level of grinding to unlock decent perks. You better like the ones you went for, because you'll be stuck with them for quite a while! Even more appealing than that is that on the killer side of things, almost every good killer perk is on a dlc killer. But wait, \"there must be a system to get dlc perks, like it's some kind of free to play game, even though I've already purchased the game, right?\"\n\nLet me introduce you to the holy 'Shrine of Secrets'. The Shrine of Secrets \"randomly\" places 4 perks per week as available for purchase with in-game, earnable, level-based currency. I say randomly because the best and most necessary perks for some reason appear extremely rarely on the shrine. Odd. Oh, and perks from \"f2p\" base game characters appear on the shrine as frequently as DLC perks. I'm not making this up.\n\n-The devs have literally no clue about how to design their game. Our friends The Legion from earlier are a prime example of that. The Legion circumvent all of the mechanics survivors have to run away, and that's only the beginning of their naughty list. In Dead by Daylight, the survivors can make use of pallets and windows to run away from the killer. For most killers, these will extend the chase and buy the survivors time. The killer must break the pallet to get through it, or vault through a window at around half the speed a survivor can vault it. With their power, The Legion just jumps over these objects like they're a survivor. The devs have literally and figuratively designed a character that jumps over the gameplay elements of their game. The Legion is quite symbolic, really. They also run at mach speed while using their power and have no penalty for missing their attacks. Even the other killer that can circumvent pallets and windows (The Nurse) has a penalty for missing attacks. Oh, I forgot to mention The Nurse, the other killer they released who can circumvent gameplay elements. By teleporting. Small details. \n\nIronically The Legion isn't even good despite this because of other aspects of their character. They're just incredibly unfun to play against. Oh and The Nurse? She's the best killer in the game by a landslide. Obviously.\n\n-The in-game community is one of the worst I've ever seen. There is this weird, incredibly primal and childish mentality of \"it's us against them\" which is incredibly common among players who play mainly killer or survivor. Survivors and killers will likewise go out of their way to try to frustrate others in-game because \"I was up against such an asshole killer/survivor last match, let's see how they like it!\" There are people who complain about survivors \"gen rushing\"; which in other words is: \"completing the objective of the game.\"\n\n-The killer has such a power to make the game unfun for individual survivors within a game that killer players are literally expected to \"play nice\" and self moderate the amount of fun they let the survivors have. This is done by choosing to cycle attacks between different survivors, to the killer's detriment... Absolutely ludicrous. \n\n-The game is \"ranked\" mode, only. No casual mode or anything else, just \"ranked\". I personally don't have too much of a problem with this idea in theory, except for the fact they do not design the game around it in any way whatsoever. There is no voice chat available in-game so players who queue together have an extreme advantage that other survivors don't have. This is not accounted for in the matchmaking system so grouped players are treated the same as solo queue players. On top of that, killers see when people join their lobbies and many killers who care a lot about their rank will refuse to play against grouped players, further increasing the delay in matchmaking. \n\nThe casual and serious players are forced to mix together in the absolute worst way. As a survivor who cares about ranks you will be paired up with survivors who will use nonstrategic, often game sabotaging (wink, wink) strategies which will throw the match. As a casual player you are plagued by killers who use unbalanced, unfun addons and offerings as a way to power-rank; as well as other survivors who will play selfishly, screwing you over just to increase their own rank. It is the worst of both worlds.\n\nThe game also has heavy rng based on map, map generation, which killer with what perks and addons you are up against, yadda yadda yadda\u2014 so much so that the idea of a ranked system for the game is a joke among highly skilled players. Not to mention that the ranked system is hardly a measure of skill itself, because of how ranking up works. As long as you do the bare minimum and complete one objective by mindlessly holding left click for 60 seconds at least one time per game, it is incredibly likely you won't lose rank, regardless of how well or poorly you played. This means that the players at top ranks are often those who just play the most, and are frequently not the most skilled players the game has to offer. At some points it can be observed that the higher you rank up, the worse the teammates you get are. \"Ranked.\" Oh yeah and the rankings reset every month. Again, small details.\n\nTragically this game actually has a fun foundation that can be quite addicting, under all the layers of ****. It's like a **** layer cake. \n\nThe ultimate **** layer cake.", "timestamp_created": 1550223095, "timestamp_updated": 1550226426, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504160881042480469", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48855255": {"recommendationid": "48855255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079389819", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 508, "last_played": 1551554647}, "language": "english", "review": "I think we've done a pretty good job so far\n\nFix you fucken shit devs\n\n\n(also thanks volvo for the censorship)\n\n\nps the assymetric game idea makes for some bs matches, glad I got sandbagged with my bloody party streamers for a grand total of 3.8 points", "timestamp_created": 1549658268, "timestamp_updated": 1551466214, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48978662": {"recommendationid": "48978662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036083292", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "last_played": 1551404310}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah, its good, with a few exceptions.

Unfortunately, there aren't other games with this kind of gameplay, so if you haven't learned the game beforehand, your experience might be less positive than others. I'd recommend watching other people play this game to get the gist of the meta before immediately jumping in.\n\nPositives:\n[*]Fun game with friends\nThis game is best played with 4 other people you know, with voice communication with all of your (assumed) friends. You'll have a blast. Nothing to it.\n[*]Interesting and original progress system\nThe bloodweb system is super cool (to me). By doing the right things, you get bloodpoints, which you can use to buy stuff in a character's bloodweb. By \"completing\" a bloodweb, that character levels up, and a new bloodweb is randomly generated. \n[*]Still has active devs\nWriting this just after Lunar New Year event with new stuff. Plus balance patches.\n[*]Fun for weird nerds like me\nIt's like being in a horror movie, and you can choose which kind of person you want to be (guy who always dies first, fearless leader, merciless killer, etc). If your into that stuff, wait until 50% off because it happens a lot and you get get super savings.\n\nNegatives:\n[*]Ranking system is broken\nSeasons reset and killers with a super build can go against potato players. Consistently. I'm sure there's a better way to matchmake, right?\n[*]Throwing is extremely detrimental\nIf you have an early disconnect, killer basically wins every single time (unless potato)\n[*]Online random multiplayer can be kinda cancer\nNo good multiplayer game is without a [b] toxic [/b] community\n[*]DLC is much expensive\nI'm broke, and I can't buy all DLC because I'm broke. You really need all the DLC to get the fullest experience out of the game.\n[*]Unfriendly to toasters\nCan't directly change to a specific resolution, making this game run at around 40 frames on my toaster. If you don't use a toaster, good for you, capitalist scumbag.\n\nIn short, if you know what you're doing, and don't use a toaster, the game is basically like the Overwatch of 4v1 multiplayer with some tweaks here and there. If you got this far, I probably haven't convinced you that this game is worth $20+DLC. In that case, I'm sorry that I can't share how addicted I am to this game.

Please fix the crouching animation for the male characters as they look like they are going to crap themselves with a strange bent back while going around, along with the leg rig being a bit to low on the model.\nFinally hitboxes, come on we all know it only takes 1 button to press to fix them so please sort this out its embarrassing.\n\nI have put hundreds of hours into this game and would like to see improvements to overall content rather then new killer and survivor and maybe a failed side game. I want to enjoy this game do not tell me to just play something else fix the issues and maybe you wont have your community crying constantly.\n(If there are any typos I'm sorry)", "timestamp_created": 1550946918, "timestamp_updated": 1550946918, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539912879467010498", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48853772": {"recommendationid": "48853772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077781977", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 81901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1912, "last_played": 1551844487}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is trash now, favors killer way too much", "timestamp_created": 1549653245, "timestamp_updated": 1549653245, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526315808296203613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48945069": {"recommendationid": "48945069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063959370", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 9179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 93, "last_played": 1551330610}, "language": "english", "review": "Pumping out cosmetics and still no dedicated servers", "timestamp_created": 1549966008, "timestamp_updated": 1549966008, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484864175319671631", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49132107": {"recommendationid": "49132107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179951646", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 323, "last_played": 1551550799}, "language": "english", "review": "Community is cancer", "timestamp_created": 1550726791, "timestamp_updated": 1550726791, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535733461380004883", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49099877": {"recommendationid": "49099877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167420742", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 14415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3121, "last_played": 1551795790}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is unplayable at the moment because of save file error 300 the game is fun tho but wont suggest it atm wait for a possible fix before buying the game.", "timestamp_created": 1550580434, "timestamp_updated": 1550580434, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543379008769989014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49049437": {"recommendationid": "49049437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198819704193", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 130, "last_played": 1551468123}, "language": "english", "review": "Toxic players, OP Killers - and you. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1550398475, "timestamp_updated": 1550398475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553738296031951904", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49128486": {"recommendationid": "49128486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006473641", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 557, "last_played": 1551750806}, "language": "english", "review": "Go ducking learn how to code a game since the reporting system is broken (understand \"has never been implemented\") no one seems to care about as soooooooo many cheaters have been spotted then reported in the game but ducking noooooooothing to do with it. \n\nAnnnnnnd now this $hit randomly crashes buuut never came across any issue with the shop section hey hey heyyyyyyy. \n\nOk, getting a fix or dedicated servers at the very least before summer 2019 would be a great achievement so hey dreaming still is cost-free lmao.\n\nDownvoted. \n\nWhen could we expect to get rid of p2p?

The killer's role is to be as sneaky, underhanded, and brutal as possible to get the 4 on meat hooks as sacrifices to a demonic Entity that feeds on emotions of crushed hopes, fear, and torture. The killer doesn't have to be nice, does not have to \"play fair\", does not have to coddle.

Speaking of, wanna play Michael Myers effectively, another DLC character? Fuck you buy Spark of Madness to unlock a perk that makes Myers barely meta.  Wanna play the game and not get gen-rushed to hell before you even get a chance to play? Again, fuck you buy Of Flesh and Mud for a perk that EVERY Killer needs, and I mean it is basically required if you ever wanna keep playing by the single digit ranks. \n\nWhile I love playing as Myers, the headache and annoyance of the frankly shoddy balancing and inept developer team leaves this game with little to be desired other than the fun-factor of living out a horror movie. (seriously, they really dropped the ball on a lot of things, like having a bug where Freddy Krueger would experience massive movement speed slowdown using his power going on since his release in 2017, which was only recently fixed in 2019... that is a whole new level of incompetence).\n\nA secondary gripe I have is with the toxic community, and being an asymmetrical 1v4, a majority of that toxicity comes from Survivors who can't take a loss or take winning too seriously. Is faceamping and such a bad manner thing on the Killer's behalf? Yeah it is. But it is vastly outmatched by tea-bagging, flashlight spam-clicking, blatant hypocrisy (you would see Survs crying about certain Killer perks when they run stuff like Decisive Strike and Dead Hard alongside abusing a certain skin for a character that makes them basically invisible to the naked eye). \n\nPersonally I find a sense of satisfaction slamming Survivors like these, my profile with the comments should be proof enough of that accomplishment. \n\nWould I still keep playing this game despite what I said? Yes. But I highly doubt I would be suggesting it to any of my friends with enthusiasm. \n\nUntil the team manage to get their shit together and start pushing out some proper updates instead of more DLCs that further break balancing, I would not recommend this game to anyone.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1549622001, "timestamp_updated": 1549622001, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48851600": {"recommendationid": "48851600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198823624711", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1551472440}, "language": "english", "review": "I want my money back!!\n\nI've seen youtubers play this so I know I'd love it.\n\nHOWEVER, I have not been able to play.

Another case where team mates purposely kills you by unhooking you right beside the killer which grants you instant down and following your death. \n\nDon't get me started of the balancing of the survivors and killers. I don't see how players are able to enjoy such a game where there's unbalanced abilities between survivors and killers. There are too many perks that are not used in the game. It's always the same perks between the survivors and killers. There's literally almost no point in trying other perks as they are not as universal to some perks that only DLC contents offers. Game occasionally hangs on the loading screen if the killer (Host) crashes during his loading screen. To further add on to the negative point of the game will be how the community is not playing the game as supposed to be.\n\nGame is filled with bugs and lag issues. Match making is one hell of a problem where most players are always met with laggy killers that \"teleports\" or you as the survivor unable to run from the killer.

Also one of my main complaints is being fixed in summer 2019.\n\nIn my short time playing this game, I've come to have this love-hate relationship. The main reasons why I love this game is that it's so much fun surviving with friends. It's also fun to occasionally farm with killers and survivors alike during events. The game has conceptually perfected the 1 vs. X multiplayer horror genre. I love the regular references to horror classics with cosmetics, as well as the original characters themselves when it comes to the killers. When surviving, I love that the game really flourishes when everyone wants to win as a team, rather than go for the hatch every game. When solo surviving, I feel like I can not only work with everyone, but when it all falls through, I can still win by finding the hatch, or outplaying the killer.\n\nSummary of pros:\n- Fun with friends\n- Original characters are neat\n- Great 1 vs. X multiplayer Horror\n- Don't need to win as a team\n- Overall friendly community during events\n\nThat said, there is a lot that does keep me from enjoying the game to it's fullest. While there's a ton of nice players in the community, I've had an equal amount of run-ins with the most diarrhetic shits this game could offer. This isn't far off from other online games, but whenever I run into them, it's at the worst of times. They fixed this, but I also had a big problem with D-strike in the game. It just sucked when you're about to 4-man, and your obsession strikes you and gets the hatch. Also when others are surviving with friends, one of them would sacrifice themselves in order to spoil the perks to the other three, which makes the game just not as fun. Equally speaking, DC's heavily cripple the game if you're surviving. In my last  spree of matches, I've had at least one every match. This ends me with the final issue, and is the main reason why I've held off dedicating a lot of time into the game. This game is lacking what is so desperately needed; dedicated servers. It's terrible to play a game where you're left having to test ping every lobby. It's even worse when it benefits the killer. I noticed that this game had a couple tournaments as well. If that's the direction Behavior wants to take, they need to implement dedicated servers, or we'd have an issue similar to what happened early on in For Honor's release. I'm happy to know that they will add dedicated servers in the summer of 2019.

Doctor and Legion both give me cancer as survivor, because games against them last an eternity, especially when they cheese and patrol 3 gens, or when legion tunnels. They have also nerfed flashlights which is kinda understandable but at the same time a purple flashlight is near impossible to even get from a bloodweb as survivor so I don't think they should have been nerfed to the extent that they have been now. They should not have changed the ranking system from where they had it before when you could get ranked up by hooking and not by how many kills or gens the survivors do counting against you because it just leads to a guarantee that you will run into killers that suck but have noed and get one kill at the end of the game and camp to try to at least get a safety pip, without fail it litterally happens every game i play as survivor against a boosted killer. The things i like is that there is a lot less infinites but some maps still have them and long walls on strode map are cancer. there's  long walls that could randomly generate on the map and it's impossible to catch survivors, especially when the long wall has two windows or some pallets near it. Other than long walls on strode map and occasional T walls placements killer is so easy and boring. Please add some rewards for ranking up because there is like no incentive at all to do so at this point. I don't think the game is bad, but it has somewhere along the way lost what made it fun. It's much better now than what it was at when there was no survive with friends or when they first implemented it and it was literally impossible to find a match and you had to keep readying up, or when there was infinites on every map, but it's just not that fun anymore. Maybe they can add more game modes and stuff and fix some of the bugs that they have and it would be fun but untill then i'm not gonna be playing this game consistently anymore.

It reallly sucks when the killer decides to camp or tunnel you, especially if your \"teammates\" did not helped all game or screwed you over that game (not all survivors are incompetent). Can't really do much about it when he is ignoring the other survivors and it's not like the game dev can do much about it either (nor are they going to). Just because you can do something, doesn't make it right. They claim that \"it's a strategy,\" but if that's the case, why isn't every killer doing it? It's just integrity and sportsmanship (and the good players don't need to rely on it). I've seen killers with amazing out-plays, predictions, or game sense. same can be said for the survivors. It just takes practice, skills, and a little bit of luck (I'm not that great of a survivor/killer, but I a least try to have fun, I know right? Fun in a game?). Camping on the other hand should have an actual punishment. Especially when the killer have abilities that makes it easier/encourages them to do so, i.e. hag. Why double camp? Yes, both side are toxic, that's not anything new. At least as killer you can go after and kill those people. Killers can literally ruin a game if they wanted to, by how they play, while survivors can't do that to the game (they can annoy the killer and each other though). Also as killer, you don't have to deal with idiot teammates that just wants to farm you, sit in lockers, or crouch in a corner (not to mention survivors leaving or d/cing A LOT). I see people drop all the time or rubberbanding from lag, etc. You get hit or miss when you shouldn't have, all of which makes the game unplayable. When it comes to toxicity, I understand everyone has those days (from both sides), but if you are blatant with your BM or toxic all the time, then you should take a break from gaming. That's pretty much the state of game in a nutshell.\nThe game itself on the other hand, hasn't been as good since the spirit update. It has changed a lot and improved in some ways, while getting worse in others, such a balancing characters. Every time there is a patch, something breaks, glitches, or a new bug is introduce. Than you have players that take advantage of it. The ranking system needs a lot of help, especially when it resets. New players should avoid playing during that time. The match making system, if there is even one, needs serious rework as well. I've seen rank 19s survivors pitted against ranked 4 killers, or vice versa often (or something along those lines). Why do you lose your offering all the time AND rank sometimes, if the killer leaves or d/c? This needs be changed since d/c happens on both sides a lot, either because of the server, the players, or the game itself. Maybe have a way for survivors be able to host too, that way it isn't just killers with the abilities choose their lobby (although I understand that that survivor would have to stay in the game)? Soo many times have games started, or even before the game starts, just to d/c right after. Why the hit boxes for paletes better than the ones on survivors? Why do killer attacks get stuck on thin air? Why do you get stuck or random or invisible objects? Some many questions unanswered. I do have to say, this is one of the better game in it's genre. I still remember feeling excited when I first saw the trailer for it. If not for my friends, I would have stopped playing this game (they were also the ones that got me hooked on it). It's honestly more enjoyable/bearable with someone. Welp, I'm done expressing my frustration and ideas about the game, hopefully this helps whoever reads it. Who knows, maybe there could even be positive changes made from both the players and developers, then I'll have to change my review.

However, I feel the game is very fun for casual players only. Once you begin to get very good at the game and get thrown into matches with better players, the game takes a very repetitive approach. The killers & their perks, as well as the survivors & their perks become very repetitive due to how horrible certain things are in the game. If you want to be the best killer in the world on PC, your chances are significantly lower if you were to choose a killer like..... Freddy. If you are a survivor, you will learn VERY quickly which perks you are probably going to use every game. The developers have no plans in balancing the game as a whole, as they have already stated that some killers & certain perks are meant to be \"fun\", and not competitive. This makes NO sense, because they are trying to define what \"fun\" is for everyone. For me personally, \"fun\" involves winning, BUT NOT with the same killer or perks EVERY SINGLE GAME. I would enjoy the game a lot more if I had the same chance winning, no matter what killer or perks with survivors I use. You might get unlucky and get a map that none of your perks or killer are any good at, but that's alright. To sum it up, if you are looking to play this game casually and have some fun surviving or killing survivors, then this game is perfect for you. If you are looking to play a game you plan on becoming the best in because of how competitive you are, this is not the game for you. There are plenty of other games that will offer you a better chance at being competitive. Games at higher ranks will become more and more frustrating. Not because the people you are playing with are getting better, but because you have no freedom in what killer you want to kill with, or what perks you want to use as a Survivor.\n\nOne last thing....

Do not buy this game. Like you've probably read, it's a great concept with horrible execution. They keep trying to fix old problems by putting in new systems and basically for each balance tweak we get 2 new bugs pop up and there are no fixes to the old bugs, but new cosmetics come out every other week.\n\nThis game will crash, you will be harassed in game and post game, and the player rank, player level, character level, bloodpoint, and shard grind will probably be enough to turn new players away. It's just so bloated with grinding, and problems that those moments of joy or triumph that people come to this game for are quickly taken away by the overwhelming amount of punishment a player has to face.\n\nDLC and updates are consistent and maps are free, which is really nice, but the content is usually a flash in the pan, then another thing for the community to be toxic about. Just as well DBD has it's cake and eats it too by charger for the base game, DLC, and cosmetics. With 9 DLC currently, all priced at 6.99, plus 19.99 for the base game, it would cost about $83 just to have access to all the content. This is before grinding to get to actually use it. This can also end up putting pay gates up around content that might end up being meta.\n\nI'm a fan of this game, and because they have a strong hold on the multiplayer horror market, I'll still be playing it through this unsatisfactory time. Still, coming back in to it on a new platform and seeing what the experience is from the top to the bottom I can tell you that unless you're a die hard horror fan, have friends to play this with, or already know dead by daylight and are willing to jump back in you will regret this purchase.\n\nWait until the summer when there are sales, and DBD starts using dedicated servers.

Reaching rank 1 gives you nothing but a shitty achievement that doesn't really matter. You get no rewards and usually run into the same people at least 3 times a day. The lobbies are horrible as the killers are probably live halfway across the world from you so the ping is terrible. It might take you up to 15 minutes just to find a lobby with at least 120+ ping\n-SWF makes the game unenjoyable and frustrating if you are facing a really strong team as the game was never built around voice chat and they can call out your position and know your next move all the time.\n-The bugs and hitboxes are annoying as fuck noticable mostly in killers such as Nurse and Huntress.\n-Legion and Nurse are extremely broken characters, if the killer knows what they are doing it can be really frustrating and abuse of some addons and mechanics can be almost unbeatable.\n-Hatch standoff, Yep I know this topic gets mentioned a lot in the community but there is litteraly nothing you can do if you play killer i'll just keep this point short as you've probably heard this brought up a billion times.\n-Not going to mention perks such as NOED and DS as DS is getting a re-work and it probably won't be long until they change their mind about NOED.\n-The community, oh boy... If you play killer expect to be called every insult under the sun and reported at least 3 times per match. Rank 1 survivors constantly tea bagging and sandbagging teammates. \n\nNow good things and things I personally enjoy about the game.\n\n-If you just want to chill out it's a pretty good game, I know I sound hypocritical because I whined about it in the points above but playing with friends is pretty fun, If they found a correct workaround tryhard gen rushing swf discord squads then it would be better but it's either we play solo all the time or we have to deal with the consequences of losing to a group of friends that may be tryharding, Idk maybe i'm just looking too in depth on this one.\n-Looking forward to Dedicated servers and more events, Events are fun and give the player base things to do in the meantime instead of getting bored of the same concept of doing gens and escaping.\n-Good variety of perks and new characters getting added into the game usually consisting of 1 survivor a killer and a new map.\n\nMy verdict - I say get it if you want to or if it is on sale and its just a game you want to play from time to time to chill out and have fun on go ahead. I personally still love the game and can find it enjoyable most of the time but unexpected changes and avoiding suggestions from the community will run this game into the ground.\nI hope this gave you a general view on my perspective of the game. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1550860172, "timestamp_updated": 1550860172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541353404521942139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49109548": {"recommendationid": "49109548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010148422", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 37927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1867, "last_played": 1551836993}, "language": "english", "review": "Game has been busted for months and they refuse to fix it.

Reporting for harassment and not telling someone what they did or specifically said is just obnoxious and extremely petty. This game also has major bugs with a good amount of the killers and an extreme lack of guiding as to how to unlock stuff if you don't want to pay for overpriced dlc. Said dlc will contain a survivor with 1 useful perk (if you are lucky), a killer with 1 useful perk, and nothing else. Not to mention, the better perks are on killers you have to buy with either the paid in game currency or real money. You can get those perks in the silly rotation thing that swaps every wednesday @ 6PM Central, but there are 2 killer perks and 2 survivor perks so your odds of landing them are pretty low. That and the fact that they don't show you how to buy killers with the ir shards is clear evidence that they want to hide the ability to purchase said characters with in game unlockable currency, but still make it technically possible so that they can say they weren't hiding it. Only about 4 killers are really good once you hit about rank 4+ and while 3 of them are killers you get for free, the perks that some of them start with are garbage and unless you really want to put time into this game and actually unlock everyones things (this will require at least a month playing for multiple hours on end). The game is wildly unbalanced with cheap perks on both sides, although being a survivor isn't terrible if you have a head. No dedicated servers brings down the quality of this game massively as it gives the killer an advantage they are the host every single time and not the person in the lobby with the best ping. This gives the killer a leg up in chases as unless you immediately learn how to loop properly and know the maps and its mechanics and have decent perks, you will get fucked. This game will not tell you how to play it properly and to learn to do so you will have to go to either youtube or twitch.\n\nOverall, pissed I got a ban for no reason (or at least you weren't willing to show me what happened that made you want to ban me, and that I think the game needs massive reworks on most of the main objectives in the game.

Something has to be changed!\n- Totems are hard to find, specially on bright maps you can't see clearly if they are burning or not\n\nNEGATIVE IN MATCHMAKING\n- You join so often in high ping lobbies, the developer doesn't think to change anything. Maybe a matchmaking pre-selection on latency or region would be a great idea?! The bad ping benefits has only the killer because he hosts the lobby.\n- If you lose the connection to steam friends the game can't be played anymore. You get disconnect from game lobby and you can't do anything till it's working again.\n- Often random disconnects from lobby in loading screen as survivor, but the lobby still exists further.\n\n\nAll in all, they bring out a lot of content for additional money but they aren't solving the basic connection problems in the game.

Terrible for competitive players who like to settle down with a balanced competitive game with variety.\n\nYou can read what the game is about, it's rules and gameplay on videos. So I'm going to give the summary from the perspective of someone who really got hooked (haha) on the game with 100+ hours and rank 1 on killer but now really dislikes playing and has uninstalled.\n\nPro's: \nGreat concept\nInteresting veriety of characters\nCheap cost\nGreat horror thrill as a survivor\n\nCon's: \nThe most toxic community I've played with - Fellow survivors will screw you over (get you off the hook right infront of the killer) just for points. Trying to catch a survivor? Get ready for some intense teabagging around near-infinite loops\nPainfully unbalanced - there is quite a strict hirearchy of good/bad perks for either side and a few mandatory ones (the killer version requiring a DLC purchase). There is also a very very strict hirearchy for killer characters (some killers like legion are completly unplayable at higher ranks).\nBuggy as hell - one in every 5 games don't load and my sacrifices/addons get wasted. Lag and glitches will see some true bull**** happen (drop a pallet on a killer but still get hit)\nActive exploits - Survivors will dc instantly if you kill them leaving you unable to get points, but they'll be around in the lobby afterwards to talk trash to you. Lots of speed hacks (you only need an extra 5% to be uncatchable)\nBadly designed maps - some of the loops in the game are just a joke, 'infinite' loops also exist where the killer CANNOT catch a survivor\n\nOverall a great concept but the flaws turn this game from a great casual gem to a frustrating toxic experience that leaves me in a worse mood than when I started playing. To add insult to injury the devs don't seem to be active in balancing the game or fixing the bugs - they just churn our DLC's for extra cash.", "timestamp_created": 1551123300, "timestamp_updated": 1551123300, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495854586362838745", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49139963": {"recommendationid": "49139963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198417601340", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 631, "last_played": 1551876045}, "language": "english", "review": "it s GOOD GAME", "timestamp_created": 1550763954, "timestamp_updated": 1550763954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49312790": {"recommendationid": "49312790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880365469", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1003, "last_played": 1551815152}, "language": "english", "review": "I really like This game its super fun but its all based on if the killer camps or not but it is a bit buggy but all around fun", "timestamp_created": 1551524794, "timestamp_updated": 1551524794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49075312": {"recommendationid": "49075312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198362507494", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 18156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3077, "last_played": 1551787155}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good job so far. survivors too op and the rest of this game also crap", "timestamp_created": 1550506161, "timestamp_updated": 1550506161, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49244450": {"recommendationid": "49244450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198796425970", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 879, "last_played": 1551799527}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is good.", "timestamp_created": 1551181342, "timestamp_updated": 1551181342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48863290": {"recommendationid": "48863290", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965901816", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549691035}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is the WORST!

If you have friends you can have fun playing as survivors called (SWF), or if you have no friends you can be a killer (this is a much harder version of the game.) The game has a lot of grind (low on content) but the grind isn't totally necessary as the perks don't do a whole lot and most perks are kind of useless. The game is terribly balanced and is immensely stacked in the killers favour.  Just kidding.  The game is totally survivor sided and SWF breaks the game entirely as it is horribly imbalanced. I did have fun in my over 1000 hours playing this game but generally this is as survivor with a SWF.  The game is pretty boring as there isn't much to do and talking to other people is more enjoyable than the actual gameplay.  Gamers tend to be sweaty nerds in general in games, and when games are so imbalanced like this - nerds will innovate the fun out of the game through 'the meta.' The meta has changed a little bit when it comes to survivors it is no longer the Borrowed Time, Self Care, (Exhaustion Perk), Decisive Strike; as BHVR attempted to try to be a real gaming studio and put on the appearance of balance.\n\nI can't recommend the game to anyone.  It takes 300-400 hours to learn how to play as a survivor (as there is no real ranking system) and 400-500 hours to learn a particular killer. The learning curve is very steep.  Most people will not be willing to put in the effort to really understand specific killers such as Hag or the muscle memory such as Nurse.  The easiest killer to 'git gud' with is Billy. All survivors are identical but Claudette has a brown skin and Adam has a black suit skin that provide unbelievable camo in this game.

Followed by a crap load of bugs! \n\nPROBLEMS: \n\n1. Terribly unbalanced. Some killers have perks which for the most part seems to be balanced, but when there are only a couple or just  one survivor left its over powered. For instance, a clown camped a hatch, chucked his gas things and had literally no cool down. This allowed him to keep spamming it and camp the hatch and the remaining generator which was close to the hatch as well.\n\n2. Broken hitboxes. Absolute garbag hitboxes. I thought FPS games had horrible hitboxes but this game takes the cake for being the absolute WORST. A killer can hit you even though he swung at the air. \n\n3. Broken animations. A killer can lunge at you from a mile away because this is how the animation works, so it completely ignores the killers original speed and goes Usain Bolt and hits you. Other times, you see a pallet and you try to throw it down but it doesn't because it doesn't show the space bar option even though you are directly in front of it and looking at it.\n\n4. Extremely toxic community. Surviors will disconnect at the beginning for a pathetic punishment. No points and a potential derank. Wow! This is even worse when it comes to killers who disconnect because the survivors got all the generators and so the game just stops. Ridiculous how abandoners get absolutely no cool down whatsoever for ruining it for everyone else.\n\n5. Awful servers. Your connection as a survivor depends on the killers connection. If the killers get 300 ping then so do you. If the killer lag switches and unplugs his ethernet then you freeze as well. \n\nPlenty of other bugs but these are the main ones that truly ruin the game.\n\nAnyways, enjoy playing a twisted hide and seek with a bunch of bugs!", "timestamp_created": 1549497219, "timestamp_updated": 1549497219, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458333343267440796", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49145001": {"recommendationid": "49145001", "author": {"steamid": "76561198226615856", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 29706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 852, "last_played": 1551588787}, "language": "english", "review": "Shitty game, Devs are buffing killers and nerfing surviors over and over, not to mention they call camping a mechanic.

This would also be fine but the killer(s) are so immensely powerful and there's literally nothing you in your power in about 40% of situations. For example if a killer can run faster then you, your options quickly become limited, you'll either need to have some sort of abilty of your own done through perks, be in a really good spot on the map to your advantage or get lucky and have a killer who doesn't know the difference between their mouse and keyboard.\nthere's so much in this game that the killers get in their arsonal that it becomes a problem quickly i haven't even scratched the surface with me talking about them being able to move faster above. i could overlook all of this if it wasn't for how the leveling and character and item system was handled that's the biggest issue with me.\nyou get blood points by completing actions in the game such as escaping repairing generators and healing friends all that good stuff right, anyways you get blood points and take them to your skill tree, and this is where the logic ends the entire tree is 100% RNG based, and it sucks because most of the characters you can choose from have a play style, a mechanic doesn't need a medkit and a medic doesn't need a toolbox, and some guy running around the map as a distraction really doesn't need a toolbox. on top of that items have addon's to make them more effective and there's offering which is like a global buff at the start of the round, this makes matters even worse because now a mechanic has a med-kit that he doesn't want, and spare gauze and bandages for his medkit that he doesn't want and buff that rewards you with more points for healing people that the mechanic never wanted to heal in the first place. the same goes for our medic friend now hes got a whole array of tools from protective gloves and scrap metal and a buff that makes it easier to repair shit that you didn't want to repair. If this wasn't bad enough i got into the game when the chinese new year was happening you know the big event for like half the planet while the other half kinda just scratches their butt a bit? anyways this also wouldn't be a problem if now tool box's med-kits and other tools are being replaced with chinese fireworks and other chinese decorations that don't help even nearly as much as some actual items. you can't opt out of events either so you're pretty much stuck with that item. The items you get for use in game aren't trade-able either so its not like a medic and mechanic can just swap unwanted items, even if you could do this it wouldn't matter because items are bound to character so Mr-mechanic trading with Mrs-medic because it would just move Mr-mechanics med-kit to Mr-medics mechanic character this also makes it so you can't just take all you items/perks/offerings you earned and move them to the person you need. to do that you need to hit the max level and prestiege in call of duty fashion.\nPerks are the second huge issue, it takes a very long time to get them, they're bound per character until you reach a high level and a vast majority of them are useless or far far to situational to ever be useful, some of the perks are 100% dependent on the enemy playing a certain killer that you won't know who it is until its too late to pick perks. you can only guess. For example there's a perk that alerts survivors to traps within 12 meters of them. pretty useful so you don't fall into a dangerous bear trap and get murder hobo-ed right? wrong. only a single killer can place traps and hes not often played. if you picked this perk thinking the trapper would be played and he wasn't it's a waste of a perk that will do nothing for the rest of the match. Since perks are really hard to get every perk is precious and it makes it all the more disapointing when you get \"this perk alerts you to the killers location for 5 seconds upon escaping the map, provided its the 3rd Friday of the month only at any time between 11am-11pm unless the US government is shutdown during the time there is a republican majority in the house, and  you're mothers, mother hasn't passed on and has eaten a chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce in the past 48 hours.\"\nanyway that's my rant for now half this shit doesn't even matter to people with 500 or more hours on the game, which is a shame i want to have fun too not just die over and over until i have enough wacky bucks.\nrecommend for now.", "timestamp_created": 1549581632, "timestamp_updated": 1549581632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49075449": {"recommendationid": "49075449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083650245", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 23354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550506696}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't buy this shitty ass bug of a game.

Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor, The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.\n\nAs Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. \n\nI mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.\n\nBut what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks, Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave.

And while that is a legitimate strategy, it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion.\n\nAs a killer (a horrible one), I've also been called names by survivors who tell me to 'get gud.'

Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor, The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.\n\nAs Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. \n\nI mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.\n\nBut what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks, Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG.

If you're looking for scares, I wouldn't consider this to be a scary game because it becomes quite predictable over time. It doesn't have enough build-up of suspense to instill fear of actually getting caught by the killer. That said and set aside, I enjoy a good chase, or simply losing the killer's line of sight and giving them the slip. It can be quite funny when you outsmart someone by hiding around a tree or a rock. There have been times where I have lost killers simply by doing circles around an object and remaining hidden. Those moments are where the game succeeds in my eyes. Hide and seek has always been fun for me in games that can manage to get it right, and it's one of the aspects that drew me to Dead by Daylight. It's a game about being sneaky, and trying not to get caught. On the other hand however, getting seen on purpose and taking the killer for a long chase helps your team repair generators unhindered and also gains you plenty of boldness points for distracting and ultimately helping your team escape as a whole, because every second a killer spends wasted on chasing a pro runner is a second your 3 teammates need to utilize towards getting the 5 generators in the map up and running to power the exit door. Contentwise there is a continued introduction of new killers and survivors alongside them, each with their own unique abilities which keeps things interesting. As with any game I feel the need to mention that a community and the people encountered in online situations are what make and break a game, and sometimes it's possible that you get a killer that camps you after he has hung you up on the hook, which can be very not fun. \n\nI give Dead by Daylight an 8/10 and I've enjoyed my many hours playing, and so I will recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1537579539, "timestamp_updated": 1537580133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.818839371204376221", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47288838": {"recommendationid": "47288838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068398113", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 57152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2342, "last_played": 1551867395}, "language": "english", "review": "This is simultaneously the most fun, and most infuriating game I've played in a long time.\n\nIt's an asymmetrical game where one player is a powerful killer, hunting down 4 elusive survivors before they can start generators and leave the trial.\n\nFor an asymmetrical game, it's in a state where it's surprisingly balanced between the two sides. Either side has a few things that infuriate the other (Decisive Strike and No One Escapes Death are the current front runners) and certain killers are notoriously overpowered, or underpowered. Freddy Kreuger mains, for instance, must hate themselves to play that, and Nurse mains must just hate playing the game fairly.\n\nNew content is regular, 1 killer, 1 survivor, 3 perks for each side, and a map are released every 3 months or so, mid chapter balance patches occur, and cosmetics are regularly added.\n\nThere are downsides however. While balance patches come regularly, they won't do anything incremental. Freddy is ridiculously weak, but they refuse to give him small quality of life changes that they have said he needs until they are ready to release a full rework of him. Meaning rather than sitting at a 'meh' stage, he sits in boring, weak and generally unfun.\n\nPay to pay to keep paying. Buying the game will net you around half the cast. Many are also available through grinding, however licensed killers and survivors require further payment. Their perks are also locked to you, unless they are picked on the \"random\" weekly shrine. (The good ones rarely are.) On top of this, despite in game currency being used for cosmetics, anything they think looks good or will be popular is locked behind payment only.

Where killing requires significantly more concentration, survivor is somewhat more chill as an experienced player, but is often an M1 simulator if you dont involve yourself with the game much. This repetivity is very clear, but the different survivors you play against all have different playstyles, and the killers have completely different \"powers\" which can tilt the game at any point. If you want a more relaxing experience to sit down and play something, then it would be better to play survivor. Killer requires endless concentration and intense focus so you need to be in a proper gaming mood.\nI would highly recommend this game to someone who needs a time-waster video game and wants to funnel some hours into it in their spare time. It's a good horror for the first 50 hours but loses that factor after you stop taking the game seriously in terms of getting scared.

I will provide a pro/con list, and then rebuttle the most common negative claims against the game. \n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n* Developers are active within the community\n* Lots of progression and levelling to give you a reason to keep coming back\n* Survivor perks from DLC are accessible to those without DLC, only requiring extra effort.\n* Game is, despite what some players may say, balanced.\n* Allows teamplay with minimal communication\n* Lots of tension, and some required decision making\n* Long lifetime, game produced 1 year ago, and still supports an average of 8,000-10,000 players per day\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n* Decent amount of the community is toxic, but welcome to the internet\n* Peer to Peer connection (If the killer's internet is bad, your ping/connection will be bad)\n* There are a fair amount of bugs/glitches in the game, but none are entirely game breaking. \n\n\n\n[h1] Rebuttles [/h1]\nOne popular claim is that the game is horrible due to it's toxic community. My main contention here is that the game does not permit voice chat, and instead provides you with two emote options. One to point, and one to wave. Some survivors will tbag on the other side of objects just to aggravate/annoy the killer, but that isn't really a viable issue to hate the game for. Overall the coommunity is no reason to hate the game, and it isn't even that severe. \n\nA second, extremely popular complaint, is that camping a surviver that is on the hook as the killer is overpowered and should be removed somehow (which would be incredibly complicated to do from a development standpoint). The issue with this complaint is that the only time when camping is affective is when all of the survivors commit their time playing to attempting to save the survivor on the hook. If instead, the survivors chose to work on generators, statistically they could each get over 1 generator done before the player on the hook died. This would allow the players to complete enough generators to escape with only 1, or if unlucky 2... survivors being sacrificed. The issue is not with the game, it is yet again an issue with the failure of players to adapt.\n\nAnother claim is that the new killer, The Huntress, is absolutely unbalanced. The reason for a lot of complaint is that The Huntress is the first ranged killer in the game. Is she overpowered though? Not at all. I have played against an incredibly large amount of killers choosing to play The Huntress, especially seeing as it was released just one day before I made this review, and have won the vast majority of the matches. The Huntress was placed into the game to allow for both far more variation in gameplay, and to shake up the \"meta\", forcing players to adapt. The issue with that is, however, a lot of players do not wish to spend time adapting, and instead resort to despising the developers. I appreciate their attempts to add far more variation and effort into the game. One key detail that people who complain about the new killer fail to mention very often, is that the new killer can be heard from much further away, allowing for the survivor to react quicker, and hide appropriately. Although some may say that the sound of the killer's humming is quiet, in a game such as Dead by Daylight, sound is everything. You should be prepared to commit your attention entirely to the game during a match. If you do not, then your failures are not a result of the development team.\n\nMany players also complain about the lack of voice communication, because they do not feel as if your current implemented communication methods, pointing and waving, are effective enough. However, as seen with Friday the 13th: The Game, you will absolutely ruin any hopes of immersion and tarnish the horror aesthetic when you enable voice chat, which results in players blasting loud shrek theme songs through their microphones, or yelling the entire game so that you, again, can not pay as much attention too the actual game. A reply to my claim might say that you could simply permit blocking players so that you may not hear them. However, if as you said, the community is toxic, how many players do you honestly think you will not have to block? Even if you don't have too block people in a game, the killer would suffer tremendously from that communication. It is for this reason that a majority of people playing killer in the game recognize that survive with friends (swf) is even nearing overpowered. This is because the implementation of a survivor queueing system allows for survivors to communicate more, and better counter the killer during a game. If there is a great deal of hate towards a smaller system such as swf which even slightly allows voice communication, the development team should surely know better than to implement a full voice communications system for players. And they do, so I commend them for their resilience with putting up with the community's failure to fully think out their complaints. \n\n[i]I may update this review if I either recall more additions I wished to add, or other issues are brought to my attention.[/i]\n\n[b] TL;DR: People who complain about this game's issues, and quit the game due to them, do not fully understand the implications of either changing the matter, or just what they are talking about. This gameis great and worth a buy, and a popular complaint about the toxic community can explain away a great deal of people's poor reviews.

The game mechanic is great. The CORE game mechanic actually changes from movement to stealth in a way I've never experienced, even in metal gear games. Its exhillerating being chased and killed as the survivors and its fun to run around killing as the killer.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is riddled with bugs. This current update (2/13/2017) made the game unplayable. And that's not me bitching about minor changes in game play mechanics... its literally broken and won't launch. \n\nI've held off my review in hopes that the developers would patch the game so i can rave about it up and down. Welp the cows have come to pasture and I feel that after playing 120 hours of the game, posting on steam forums about bugs, participating in test servers, and emailing devs all to have a patch that renders the application completely useless i think I've earned the right to bitch about it. Hell, I'm a paying consumer so why not?\n\nYesterday I played this game almost all day and night long. In that day, after hearing about the new patch I logged every game I was able to get into and play as well as every game that crashed due to errors. \n\nMy logs for yesterday are as Follows:\n68 attempted games played\n51 games that did not load, crashed, errored out etc.\n17 games succesfully laucned with no errors and were played\n\nThat means the application worked correctly only 25% of the time. \n\nAll I can say is to stay away from this game. Its not working anymore... and even on its best days it only worked 1 out of 4 times.\n\nIf you happened to purchase this game and enjoyed it as much as I did (when it decides to work), put pressure on those devs. Thier game, as fun as it may be, is a defective product.  IT needs to be fixed or WE need to be reimbursed. You pay thier salary... not Behavior, not StarBreeze... YOU!\n\nPS, Devs... I will personally remove this post and give it an incredibly positive and equally lengthy review once the game starts working as it should. It is not my intention to keep people from buying YOUR games... it is only to keep people from buying BROKEN games.\n\nPPS, Devs... after fixing this game, how likely would it be to see another crossover monster/survivor combo?

Winning too fast and totally dominating the match can Rank you down. Being too good at the game can Rank you down. You need to play \"to farm\" instead of \"play to win\" most of the time. It's not a very enjoyable experience to play Ranked in this game.\n\n[*]The Options/Settings have nothing for keybinds, sensitivity settings, and has lackluster resolution/graphic settings.\n\n[*]The Lobby/Matchmaking System completely sucks. No way to Dynamic Queue with friends, it matches people-up with WILDLY different MMR/Skill-levels, and Queue-Dodgers do not get time-outs that should increase with each lobby that is dodged. People are constantly queue-dodging lobbies, which makes starting an actual match and playing the game a nightmare at times.\n\n[*]The Disconnect/Network System does not auto-reconnecting players back to a game when they disconnected, even if they log-back-in within less than a minute. Also, disconnected player's character models disappear from the game world, instead of being left in the game to be interacted with, like how League of Legends does it. There is also a ton of lag in-game some times while other games are amazing with no lag. It can be wildly different between matches, and you never know what you're going to get. Rage-Quitters do not get punished right now, which is a real problem. They need to get time-outs for joining new games that should increase the duration for every game that they disconnect from and they should also lose Rank points, while the players that are left in their game matches need to get Bloodpoints rewarded for the disconnected player who they cannot farm from anymore.\n\n[*]The Anti-Cheat/Exploit Systems ARE NOT WORKING and there are obvious cheaters/exploiters in the game. People with Prestige and Level 50, with 4 Ultra Rare Perks, but only have 5 hours of game time played is an impossibility. Behaviour Interactive's Competitive Esports Team needs to start taking a stance against cheaters, right now, as it's only going to get increasingly worse as more cheats/exploits are discovered.\n\n[*]The Server System is non-existent. This game should have been a Client-Server architecture, but instead they went with P2P and saving Player Data on the Client. This is a HORRIBLE idea, which is just asking for cheating/exploiting/lag-switching. The game should have had dedicated servers, where our Player Data lives at, and where matches take place on. Dedicated servers would have made the game experience WAY BETTER. What a huge missed opportunity.\n\n[*]The Company itself (Behaviour Interactive) has been super bad with their Community Managers and Esports Team, when it comes to communicating and addressing issues with the community and competitive players on the Steam forums. Their Competitive Esports Team needs to start actively revoking game licenses and banning cheaters from the game, naming and shaming them on their official website (like Blizzard does), and also posting in regards to what is and what is not acceptable play within the game, so everyone who plays Ranked matches has a baseline of what they should and should not do within a said Ranked match.\n[/olist]\n\nAgain, the game itself is good and has potential, but the systems that surround the game are really beyond freaking horrible and too frustrating to make for an enjoyable experience at the moment.", "timestamp_created": 1466288036, "timestamp_updated": 1466291544, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 937, "votes_funny": 35, "weighted_vote_score": "0.852086842060089111", "comment_count": 42, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47519624": {"recommendationid": "47519624", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093617378", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546710604}, "language": "english", "review": "---{Graphics}---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 Paint.exe\n\n---{Gameplay}---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 It\u2018s just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Starring at walls is better\n\u2610 Just don\u2018t\n\n---{Audio}---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Earrape\n\n---{Audience}---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Human\n\n---{PC Requirements}---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boiiiiii\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Difficulity}---\n\u2610 Just press \u201aA\u2018\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isnt necessary to progress\n\u2611 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You\u2018ll need a second live for grinding\n\n---{Game Time}---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2611 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{Price}---\n\u2610 It\u2019s free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{Bugs}---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2611 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs", "timestamp_created": 1544780361, "timestamp_updated": 1549464800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 281, "votes_funny": 171, "weighted_vote_score": "0.844049453735351563", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45141584": {"recommendationid": "45141584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055017547", "num_games_owned": 458, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 21574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1213, "last_played": 1551868234}, "language": "english", "review": "When you play survivor:\n-Teammates will fail skillchecks while healing you or repairing then tactically run away so you will be found and killed instead.\n-Teammates will die like a cattle trying to save hooked one from Leatherface with chainsaw ready or under Exposed (both 1 hit = dead) debuff.\n-Teammates will completely ignore you being hooked and do objectives while you buying them time dying on hook.\n-Teammates will repeatedly unhook you in front of the killer (farming points on you) so you will be downed and killed in seconds.\n-Teammates will lead killer to you or show your location with their flashlights so once again they can do stuff while you die.\n[b]>> In summary - Sociopath Simulator[/b]\n\nWhen you play Killer:\n-If you killed noone, but got plenty of points and ranked up in process - you will be called noob in game chat after the game.\n-If you killed 3 or all 4 of them - you will be called noob because used \"cheating\" (effective) perks and tactics.\n-If you killed all 4 of them without any perks (by forgetting to add them before game lol) - you will be called lucky noob.\n-If you killed the one and only guy who teabagged and distracted you all game to give him a valuable lesson - you will be called noob anyway.\n-If you killed the overconfident guy who played worse than behaved - he will probably also say something about your mom too.\n[b]>> In summary - Noob Killer Simulator[/b]\n\nThis game taught me that no matter how good you play and what you do, in the end there will always be guys expressing anger, hate, toxicity and all possible options for gay and racism insults.

Survivors must escape from the killer by repairing 5 generators and opening the two doors. Killers must chase after the survivors and sacrifice them. Survivors and killers are able to use perks, objects in the environment, add-ons and offerings that help to give advantage within the game. Dead by Daylight is also quite similar to Deathgarden from the same developer. It features a hunter that is trying to incapacitate & kill runners.\n\nWith over 300 hours in the game so far, I can honestly say it's one of my favorites. Lets start off by saying that this game isn't going to be for everyone. If you're the type of person to get salty, then chances are this game will make you extremely mad at some point. Yes, any game can make someone rage, but in Dead By Daylight, the salt is real. Almost like League of Legends, maybe even more. \n\nIf you're a killer, survivors will body block, pallet loop, pallet stun you, flashlight(Blind) you, hold you hostage(hiding and never leaving) and ragequit. If you're a survivor, killers will lag switch, face camp(not moving from you while you are hooked), slug, or focus you(most call it tunneling). Both sides have OP perks that the other side thinks is unfair, and if you main killer, you'll have to face groups of friends that are all communicating in discord which puts you at a big disadvantage. \n\nAlso, I wouldnt say its neccessary, but it is very recomended to have headphones. Whether you are the killer or a survivor. You will want to hear those footstepds, crows, survivors breathing, heartbeats, etc. Sound will play an important role in how you play. \n\nUnfortunetly, if you are here for a true horror game, you might want to look somewhere else. The initial scariness wears off pretty fast. The jump scares are still there though. Especially with Myers and Amanda. \n\nMight not be heartstoppingly scary, but If you like being startled and fancy a solid challenge, this game is great. \n\n10/10, would pay full price for this game and buy all the DLCS again.", "timestamp_created": 1545789331, "timestamp_updated": 1545790249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.804290711879730225", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39242579": {"recommendationid": "39242579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181186023", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 18422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549441427}, "language": "english", "review": "There are two things scarier than the blood hunting killers.

Or, play as the killer and hunt those kids foolish enough to stumble across your lair.  As you gain experience, you can buy perks and gain access to items to help you escape or kill.  When you start the game, it's a fun, heady experience.  Unfortunately, like a piece of fruit-striped gum, the initial rush is quickly gone.\n\nTechnical bugs abound, from minor glitches like non-working scoreboards and graphical glitches to moderate issues like broken perks to major issues like all of your game progress being eliminated (the devs recommend you make your own manual save copies) or \"infinite loading screens\" where the game locks up.  Of course, sometimes it just takes 2-5 minutes to load so you can waste a bit of time on nothing before determining if you're bugged or not.  Even if you weren't bugged, a team mate may be and they drop out leaving you down survivors before the game even starts.  Other issues exist in development choices: the matchmaking is simply terrible and often sticks your Rank 20 newbie with Rank 1-5 opponents leaving you hopelessly outclassed. Region matching is also terrible where the game can't find matches for you -- I am better off seeking a game in Ontario rather than my home region of Chicago because the game will just hang.  Then there are numerous balances issues and exploits that go unresolved.\n\nFrustratingly, through this, the developers appear to be more interested in pushing out paid DLC than fixing bugs -- and for the \"Different teams!\" excuse camp, if you have critical bugs but lots of DLC makers, then it's time to allocate your hiring resources differently.  They also rely heavily on streamers to promote the game and shower their favorite people with gifts to get good press rather than taking care of their product as recent reviews show.  Famously, one developer recently said on Twitter that exploiting streamers would not be punished because they rely on them for promotion.  When they do try to fix balance issues, they frequently overshoot. There's more survivors than killers so \"fixes\" tend to be heavy nerfs to killer perks or buffs to survivor abilities in order to quiet the loudest voices.\n\nThe game does have promise and is initially rewarding before all the other issues wear away at it.  If you can play with friends, it helps a lot just because most things are more fun with friends.

My favourite character from the genre, Jason Voorhes, the protagonist of Friday the 13th, got an awful game to my great sadness. I wanted to like it, I really did, but no luck. So I picked my dignity up from the floors of the PlayStation Store and went back to good ole' Dead by Daylight. It is a game I've always been delighted to play, albeit it getting quite repetitive after some time (if you play survivor, or after you master your playable killers if you main said role). I have to admit there have been periods of time when it was just gathering dust in my library, but once I bought my first DLC, there was no going back. The entity had pulled me in.\n\n[h1][b]THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM[/b][/h1]\n\nBefore I start judging the actual gameplay, I need to adress the thing that most of you might be looking at when opening the game's store page: the DLC. Why so much? Does it even help? Isn't it overpriced? To be very brief, this game is amazing even without any DLC. First of all, you can do great in the game without spending a single dime on the so-called \"chapters\" (since atm of writing this, the \"strongest\" killer is the Nurse, which is integrated in the vanilla character pool, and any survivor can do well in any tier). So, a Chapter gives you a new killer and a new survivor: \n1. Each survivor comes with 3 specific starting perks (see the \"GAMEPLAY\" section), which can be taught to other survivors by leveling them up until the perk becomes teachable, and will appear in the bloodweb of others OR you can purchase the perk directly with iridescent shards (the currency you earn for leveling up your account) if it appears in the Shrine of Secrets (a part of the store with 4 perks which refreshes every week) (*killer perks also available). Cool, right? Reason nr.1 you don't [b]have[/b] to buy any dlc.\n2. Each killer and survivor that [b]isn't licensed[/b](from a movie, e.g: Leatherface, Freddy, etc.) CAN be purchased from the in-game store for iridescent shards. \nYou can basically earn any content in the game that isn't licensed without spending real money. That also means the you can get the licensed characters' perks. But once you put enough hours in the game, you will want by yourself to purchase some DLC. After all, supporting devs is great!\n\n[h1][b]GAMEPLAY[/b][/h1]\n\nThe premise is simple. 5 players. 1 killer, 4 survivors. Either escape as a survivor or kill all the survivors as a killer. A killer has a basic attack, a lunge (holding down the attack button will result in a longer range but proportionally higher exhaust time) and a special ability. If you miss the attack, you get an exhaustion time in which you look down for a bit and become slower, giving the survivor a very brief escape window. The exhaustion applies on landed attacks as well, but that time it's bigger. The special ability is different from killer to killer and can manifest itself in a variety of ways, such as placing bear traps, teleporting, throwing hatchets and much much more. Survivors are all the same gameplay-wise, having no special ability, thus only being affected by the various [b]perks[/b] in-game and by the item they go into the trial (match) with. Perks buff certain actions (see the killer's outline on the map for a certain amount of time when they break a pallet) or can act as a double-edged sword, buffing a certain aspect but also having some sort of side-effect (a sprint at 150% of your speed for a certain amount of time but leaving you exhausted for a time). Items are common things such as toolboxes, medkits, or flashlights, which break over time with usage and which are lost if you are killed in a match (but fret not, you'll get more than your fair share of items). Each item and perk has a rarity grade, indicating their efectiveness. Survivors have to repair 5 [b]generators[/b] (repair speed which can be increased by using a toolbox) and open the [b]exit gates[/b] of the killer's hunting grounds to win the game. The killer has to use [b]sacrificial hooks[/b] to get survivors out of the game for good. One hit injures the survivor, making them grunt and leave trails of blood, and 2 puts them in a dying state, at which point they can be picked up and carried to an aforementioned hook. During this time, survivors can wiggle in a last attemp to escape the killer's grasp. If they are put on a hook, they can be released by a fellow teammate or if their time expires they die (you can also attemp to escape on your own at the price of shortening the sacrifice time). Each time a survivor is put on the hook again, the sacrifice advances to a point in which they will be instantly killed if it is their 3rd time on a hook (at maximum). The survivor can also evade a killer by stunning them with a pallet (if dropped straight on them), placed very conveniently all across the map for your convenience. You can vault over the pallet but the killer needs to either consume precious time by breaking it or choosing an alternate route. The maps also offer a variety of windows you can vault over and ledges you can drop from. Of course there are millions of strategies, like tunneling, rushing the generators, stealth, pallet-looping and so on, some of which are considered [b]toxic[/b](see the \"COMMUNITY\" section) , but you will discover everything on your own once you get playing.\n\n[h1][b]THE SYSTEMS[/b][/h1]\n\nRemember when I said that you'll get plenty of items? Well, that is all thanks to the [b]bloodweb[/b], the character progression system. After a match you will get a certain amount of blood points based on your actions, regardless of the match result. The blood points are universal and you can spend them for any character, be it a killer or survivor, which makes playing with your main in order to level up another character a good pasttime. The bloodweb offers various items, item add-ons (you can start the trial with max 2 add-ons on the item of your choice) which buff the item's effects (or could as well have side-effects, just like perks) and perks (because there are also a good amount of universal perks, which you can \"capture\" in the bloodweb and level up a max 3 times depending on how many times you invested blood points in them). Killers and survivors also have ranks, which are shared among all killers/survivors. You are ranked from 20 to 1 (1 being the best rank), depending on how well you do in games. Finally, there is the general player level, which rewards you with the iridescent shards I mentioned above for every level earned. This might sound a bit complicated, but believe me, once you see it in-game it all becomes clear as day. I apologize for my poor explanation skills, but I hope I managed to make you curious (at least) about the game. Now, onto a more subjective matter...\n\n[h1][b]COMMUNITY[/b][/h1]\n\nEach game has toxic tryhards, but at least the lower ranks provide a safe haven from them in DBD. To make a long story short: killer mains accuse survivors of being toxic because of them using valid strategies for winning, and vice versa. Some survivors are indeed toxic (teabagging at the exit), just as some killers are (camping a hook). This is why some players derank on purpose, to taste the good side of the game again. The matchmaking can also be a bit dumb regarding this matter, since every now and then you [b]will[/b] get matched with someone 5 ranks lower or higher than you. That's just how life is, I guess. But as long as you remember that you play for FUN, you should be all good!\n\n[h1][b]CONCLUSION[/b][/h1]\n\nDead by Daylight is the best assymetrical multiplayer game the market has to offer right now. It has a great slasher theme, combined with supernatural elements at times. You need not spend anything on DLC, but you will, once you see that the game deserves it. With an easy to learn, hard to master curve, DBD proves to be great fun, wether with friends or alone.", "timestamp_created": 1540121379, "timestamp_updated": 1543162749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687005102634429932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "44772230": {"recommendationid": "44772230", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968392084", "num_games_owned": 465, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 16958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545249763}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]What is Dead by Daylight most similar to?[/h1]\nDead by Daylight is most similar to Friday 13th with some differences such as that Dead by Daylights maps are all procedurally generated for each match, there's more survivors in one match in Friday 13th and Friday 13th only have one killer (but with different weapons).\n\nDead by Daylight is also quite similar to Deathgarden from the same developer. It features a hunter that is trying to incapacitate & kill runners.\n\nDead by daylight is however the best game in the genre right now.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nA simplistic way to describe Dead by daylight would be to say that it's a cat & mouse game. \nYou either play as the killer and try to stop the victims from escaping or you play as one out of 4 survivors trying to escape.\n\nWhen playing a survivor you need to repair a certain amount of generators in order to power up the mechanism that unlocks the exit. Once all the generators are powered up you need to flip the switch that opens the exit & escape. \n\nApart from activating the generators there's also the obvious goal of surviving and trying to save the other survivors if they've been caught on a hook. Your chances of winning are greatly enhanced while all of you are alive. \n\nWhen playing as the killer you try to incapacitate the victims so that you can lift them up and put them on a hook. The goal is to sacrifice them to feed to [i]the entity[/i]. The entity is some sort of demonic force in the game. While one victim is on the hook the remaining victims still run around trying to repair the generators so your best course of action is to try and chase them down and hook them as well. \n\nWhen the match is over your performance is graded and you're handed a certain amount of [i]bloodpoints[/i] that you can spend on new gadgets, offerings and abilities for a killer or survivor of your choice.\n\n[h1]Killers, survivors & items[/h1]\nYou have a lot of options when it comes to selecting your killer or survivor. There's currently 13 killers and 14 suvivors. Each one with its own unique set of skills and abilities. On top of that there are a lot of gadgets & offerings. Gadgets help you in some way as a tool and often has a limited amount of uses. Offerings change how things will be played in the match. They could add thicker fog, seperate survivor players or enable the killer to insta-kill survivors rather than having to hook them for example. In combination with the map system it really mixes things up and makes matches feel fresh rather than the same thing repeating over and over again. \n\n[h1]Difficulty & imbalance[/h1]\nThe matchmaking is generally pretty good and the difficulty obviously varies depending on the skill of your opponents relative to your personal skill. It is however my firm belief that this game was never meant to be played with friends over voip. As the killer there is a huge difference in difficulty when you compare playing against a pre-made group of 4 victims with playing against a group of 4 randomly matched victims. \n\nIn Dead by daylight there is no in-game chat or voip so whenever you play solo survivor you will not be able to communicate with the other survivors. If you play as a group you can communicate with the other survivors in a 3rd party voip software. This obviously gives the survivor team a huge buff since they can tell eachother where the killer is or what he's up to.\n\nIt really feels imbalanced when I run into pre-made groups as the killer & it makes me wonder why the developers did not adress it by giving randomly matched survivors a way of communicating & buffing the killers to balance it out. I've seen many other players that main killer say that they evade pre-made groups because of this.\n\nAside from that some killers feel a lot weaker than others but it's hard to say for sure since it could all come down to playstyle & you never know what the new \"meta\" could be.\n\n[h1]Maps[/h1]\nThe map-theme is randomly chosen & then the map itself is procedurally generated at the start of the match and each map is more or less advantagious depending on what survivor or killer you're playing. There's plenty of themes, it works well and keeps the game fresh. No complaints at all.\n\n[h1]Servers[/h1]\nThe servers are P2P & that is an issue that cause several problems. The killer is always the host of the session and since it's a P2P architecture that means that his machine holds all the information about the ongoing match. It means that the game is suseptible to lagswitches, cheats and even simple things such as the killer disconnecting.\n\nIf the killer disconnects using alt+f4 all of the survivors lose their gadgets and offerings because the P2P-server is no longer available to tell the main server what items they retrieved or used in the match. Behaviour gave their new IP Deathgarden dedicated servers and I hope they do the same thing for Dead by daylight sooner rather than later. \n\nWith that said; it's rare to run into cheating killers or laggy matches. It works well for the most part.\n\n[h1]Toxicity[/h1]\nToxicity is arguably one of the greatest problems with Dead by Daylight. The post-lobby chat that pops up only serves as a punching bag for the frustrated players that feel like they've been wronged in one way or another. If you do not engage in the chat you will often recieve messages on your Steam profile from angry players who feel like you did something cheesy. This happens very often no matter how you play the game.\n\nI dont really know how they could solve the issue but the chat should be removed completely from the post-lobby. It serves no purpose but to give other players abuse. Some way of encouraging other players would be a step in the right direction as well. Perhaps a \"tip\" button of some sort? I dont know. But they really need to do something to lighten the mood & enforce punishments on players that take it too far.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nIt's the best game you can get if you're looking for an asymmetrical pvp game. \nThe upsides greatly outweigh any downsides.", "timestamp_created": 1537127655, "timestamp_updated": 1537127687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.715727269649505615", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23850400": {"recommendationid": "23850400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205227816", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 48358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549589208}, "language": "english", "review": "- Ran around the woods with a chainsaw\n- Found a person and sawed them down\n- Sacrificed them on a meat hook\n- Found and killed the rest of the people in the area\n- Came home and played Dead by Daylight\n\n10/10 would play the game again", "timestamp_created": 1466999910, "timestamp_updated": 1466999910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1884, "votes_funny": 6031, "weighted_vote_score": "0.830728530883789063", "comment_count": 92, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40779542": {"recommendationid": "40779542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147950779", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 39523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1551747536}, "language": "english", "review": "I have over 500 hours in this game, so obviously I enjoyed it at one point. This used to be my favorite game and I would play it for several hours every day. But now it's a honestly such a terrible game and is only getting worse, and let me tell you why.\nThe game is centered around the idea of a killer and 4 survivors with the killer in the dominant role. There are various killers to choose from that all have cool unique abilities, but the problem is that the killer is no longer the dominant role, making the survivors both the group AND the dominant role. It started out correctly, it was buggy but it was done right with the killers actually being scary. As of now there have been so many survivor buffs and killer nerfs that playing killer is a joke and isn't fun anymore. Being a killer main I have personally experienced this gradual degression into nothingness that the developers of the game have enforced.\nThe other main problem is that the developers are the most disconnected people that I have ever seen, completely ingoring the blatently obvious problems that there game has. They focus gameplay around lower level survivors which means more experienced players are almost impossible to kill. The killer nerfs have gotten so bad that even the survivor side of the community is complaining, and that's saying something. Usually the survivors are pretty toxic, so for them to recognize a problem on the killer end of things should have been a wake up call to the developers, but to no avail.\nTo end this I would like to quote one of the developers who was asked the question \"Do you have any ideas on how you are going to impove the killer experience?\"  This was responded to with \"Maybe try survivor for a bit, or play something else for like a week. Try civilization or something.\" This was literally a developer saying that they aren't going to fix the obvious balance issues that there game has. I hope that in the future this game will be fixed and will once again be a magnificent and unique horror game, but for now please avoid it for your own sake.", "timestamp_created": 1520914957, "timestamp_updated": 1522599725, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 201, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800489902496337891", "comment_count": 24, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34085640": {"recommendationid": "34085640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322164468", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506752810}, "language": "english", "review": "Disclaimer: I survivor main. \n\nI play games for fun, not for competition, so the DBD community doesn't really get to me. If I get a bad killer that face camps, oh well. I die and move on to the next game. If I get a good killer who finds me immediately, hooks me (bc I can't juke whoops), and then patrol camps (which I'm 100% OK with), then no biggie. Next game please~\n\nI think a lot of the community salt from killers comes from dealing with rank one survivors that don't actually play the game properly and just run around and flash the killer in the face. And while that is a legitimate strategy, it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion.\n\nAs a killer (a horrible one), I've also been called names by survivors who tell me to 'get gud.' Older players ruin it for newer players or players who don't put in 1000s of hours. Just relax and have fun with the game!

The TL;DR is that it's addictively good fun, particularly with friends, but it has some deep-seated flaws that haven't been fixed since launch and are unlikely to be at any point in the future. If you don't want to put up with those then definitely give this a pass.\n\nFor your first few hours of play, DBD'll sweep you up in the fantasy of sneaking around smoke-filled woods with a monstrous murderer hunting you. You'll nervously pan the camera around looking for the Killer as you anxiously try not to miss skill check minigames on the generators you're trying to power to win. Or alternatively, you're the Killer and you catch the sweet, sweet sight of a red jacket poking out from round a rock and you know the chase is on. This fantasy stage of the game is really good fun. When you get completely new players as both sides then it's a hilarious running and screaming fest in which everyone'll come out intoxicated with the game and wanting more.\n\nWhat's frustrating is that same immersion is ruined as soon as you start to play the game a lot. When you play Killer against Survivors that know every trick in the book (many of which utterly shatter any sense of theme or immersion the game brings, such as fearlessly running up to you while you're carrying a Survivor to a sacrificial hook so that they can body block your ability to actually use the hook) then the game collapses into a frustrating mess where you feel powerless watching a player lead you around and around the same stack of obstacles and JUST as you get close then they drop a stun pallet on you and, if you're lucky, they leave you alone, but if you're not then they'll taunt you to follow them some more around another set of obstacles. You're meant to be a creature of nightmares that's terrifying and semi all-powerful, but instead you're just left running helplessly after a taunting person like some ridiculous slapstick comedy character. Oh, and you've got to stick out a whole match of this nonsense if you want to earn your upgrade points.\n\nThe 2.0 update has curtailed some of the elements of the game that enabled this play style as aggressively, but my biggest problem - and I appreciate that this may be a personal taste thing - is that the nonsense of chases around objects even exists at all. It's a clear design choice made by the developers to make it integral to surviving, but I feel the implementation of that idea feels cheap and cheesy; you mileage may vary I guess. However, now that this design element is in the game, it cannot be removed as it's so engrained into the design at this point. Survivors need a way of keeping the Killer busy during the match while their teammates do work, but the stealth elements just aren't quite good enough to achieve this. The baseline design just isn't fit-for-purpose enough for competitive gameplay that maintains the game's theme in this sense.\n\nEven if you accept that the running around silliness is a part of the game, they've been balance tweaking how it works for TWO YEARS now. Like, how does it take you TWO YEARS of play data to determine the necessary changes to fix this aspect of the game? This aspect that's been in the game since day one?\n\nMoving on to other areas of the baseline elements of the game that aren't up to muster, the game's absolutely riddled with issues that can't even be described as \"good game design.\" For example, a current play issue is that it's too easy/quick for Survivors to complete their generator objective these days. In design terms, you have to fix this by creating BASELINE modifications such as making the generator repair times take longer, however, instead of that solution, the developers added a perk that does EXACTLY that fix (Hex: Ruin - basically makes generator completion slower). So now every competitive Killer has to waste one perk slot on a perk that actually gives them a chance of achieving something before they get rushed out of the game. That slot could be used to make a more interesting strategic choice, but no, you need Hex: Ruin. You can win without it, sure, but it's very hard to do so at the high ranks. And that's part of the problem. Baseline changes made to balance the high level (like lengthening generator repair times) would screw the low level players so badly they would win games a lot less and would probably quit the game. The skill disparity between the high and low ranks makes balancing too difficult to make baseline changes, which means the devs are stuck using perks to bail them out of the game's baseline design flaws.\n\nOn the topic of perks, from a balance perspective I would say that they swing from \"completely destroys all hope the Killer has of killing you\" or \"critical for Killer success\" to \"does something, sometimes, based on a percentage chance, when a specific trigger fires, and the effect is basically nothing to write home about.\" Guess what? You NEED the good ones to be competitive, but they're unlocked entirely at random so prepare to grind levels until the RNG gives you what you want.\n\nParticularly frustrating with the perk system is how the most popular Survivor perks are the ones that basically bail the Survivor out for being fundamentally bad at the game premise itself. Get caught by the Killer? Receive a skill check test that lets you instantly wriggle out of their grasp. Take a hit in a chase you ultimately escape? Most Survivors need to have a medkit item or another player to heal them, but you can just heal yourself up at a reduced speed for free! Oh and you can use it an infinite number of times in the match! This is straight up, 100% bad design. The Killer has achieved their objective and the Survivor has explicitly failed theirs (by getting caught/hit, etc.) and yet they are bailed out by \"crutch\" perks, which, by the way, the Killer has none-to-low access to counterplay. These crutches would be fine if that's what they were used as, but instead they're just used as a way of letting Survivors make maximum risk-reward plays with a total safety net to catch them if they fail. Furthermore, when you play against entire teams using these perks then it just feels monstrously unfair to Killers, at least at the lower levels, but there're plenty of complaints at the high end too. Incidentally, Killer crutch perks (such as Hex: Ruin) have a level of counterplay or restriction open to them that almost none of the Survivor crutches have without the Killer wasting perk slots on the specific counterplay perks. For example, to counter self-healing Survivors, Killers can use the perk A Nurse's Calling, but to counter Hex: Ruin then Survivors need no perk, they just have to find a totem statue in the map during the game (can be trivial to find and does waste Survivor time, but at least they're not using up a perk slot to counter it). The devs think this creates a competitive meta of perk selection, but it's really just baseline game flaws being poorly covered instead of actually fixed at the source.\n\nHowever, despite all I've said... The crazy thing about Dead by Daylight is... I keep playing?

[/b]\n\nEDIT: I decided to edit my review after getting to know the game a bit more. The original review was after 70 hours of playing and this one is after 300 hours. The comments below reflect the original review. \n\nDead by Daylight is a 4vs1 online multiplayer game. One player plays the killer and the other three or four players are the survivors. The survivors win by working together to repair the generators and then opening the door without being killed. The killer has to find the survivors and hook them all to please the Entity. \n\n    \n[u] PROS [/u]\n\n- [b] The Perks. [/b] Each survivor and each killer have unique perks. Perks are basically equippable abilities that help you in some way. Some examples are Claudette, who can heal herself and Meg, who can sprint away quickly.  Customizing your survivor or killer adds variety to your character and lets you create your own play style.  \n\n- [b] Items. [/b] The item system adds more tension to the game. You have to level up to get items, but you lose the one you brought into the game if you die. Thus, resulting in a risk if you bring a really great item into the trial. If you are a killer, you already have your main item, and you can then attach addons. There is a nice variety of items that all have different levels of quality. \n\n  - [b] Atmosphere. [/b] The atmosphere in this game is superb. There are several different sounds that add heavy ambiance, but also serve as audio cues for both survivor and killer. I recommend quality headphones to really get immersed. \n\n - [b] The horror. [/b] The sounds, the heartbeat, the rush to the generators while constantly watching your back. It's a survival horror game and it does a great job at making you feel like you are being stalked. Meanwhile if you are playing the killer, you have a feeling you keep seeing a survivor in the corner of your eye... \n\n - [b] Teamwork. [/b]  Other then working together on the generators, your team can help you in other ways. Other survivors can unhook you, heal you, and use flashlights to try to save you from the killers grasp. If you with the right people, working together can be a lot of fun.\n\n  - [b] Killers. [/b] I know I've mentioned this before, but there is a nice variety of killers that all feel and function differently. They each have a power that sets them apart, along with the unique perks. For example: The Wraith can turn invisible, The Hag can teleport to her traps, and the Trapper can lay out bear traps for survivors to get stuck in. They have different speeds, audio cues, etc.  It's a lot of fun to try them all. \n\n- [b] First person/third person perspective. [/b]  The killer can't be killed, but he does have a weakness. His vision. Survivors see in a third person perspective, meaning they can see all around them in a wider angle. Meanwhile the killer can only see in a first-person view which gives him tunnel like vision. This makes it easier for survivors to hide when they have nowhere to go. I think this was a really neat idea that really balances out that part of the game and let's you show off your stealth abilities. The killer is faster and deadlier, but the survivor can better scope out their surroundings.  \n\n\n[u] CONS [/u]\n\n - [b] Not Newbie Friendly. [/b] Originally when I wrote this, there was no tutorial. They just added a tutorial which is really great. The game still leaves out a lot of very important things  that they only tell you on the tip screens. I honestly think games like this should have a log in the options menu where they store their tips. Also the community isn't always welcoming to newbies and they can make it very hard to learn when you have no idea what you are doing. \n\n - [b] DLC/Microtransactions [/b] Most of the non liscensed killers used to be DLC along with a whole bunch of item packs. They finally added an in game store where you can buy the non liscensed killers for shards (currency earned by playing). Although a great improvement, they also added in some seriously expensive microtransactions. I'm talking, five dollars for a shirt expensive. Right now it's just ouftits but it feels like it could lead to worse things.\n\n - [b] Bugs. [/b] This game is not as buggy for me as the reviews say. I think they patched most of it. I do get some bugs here and there though. I think the servers are the worst part. I get kicked a lot and sometimes it doesn't let me join a game. It's not enough to ruin the experience but it does take patience on its bad days.  \n\n  \n- [b] Community. [/b] I think this IS the worst thing about Dead By Daylight. All PVP games have trolls but DbD has an especially toxic community. After most matches I'm surprised when I don't get insulted. Especially playing the killer, because people hate to lose and they make sure to blame it on any term they can such as \"camping,\" \"tunneling,\" even if it's not true. This usually happens when you go up in rank, so if you play casually you won't have as many issues. My friend suggested unranked lobbies and honestly that idea would fix a lot of issues with the game. I highly recommend playing with friends since you can guarantee more fun. I still play online with strangers and although it has it's share of trolls, It still doesn't ruin my love for the game. \n\n[u] VERDICT [/u] \nIf you are interested in the trailer or description then you should grab the game. It's exactly what it advertised and it delivers on most positive aspects. There are issues with bugs and a toxic community, which is why I recommend you buy it on discount. If you plan on playing it with friends instead of online, it would probably be even more fun.", "timestamp_created": 1528111399, "timestamp_updated": 1532108451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 94, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.815869629383087158", "comment_count": 27, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "46394317": {"recommendationid": "46394317", "author": {"steamid": "76561198369147670", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 93945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1858, "last_played": 1551818241}, "language": "english", "review": "I think they did a pretty good job so far.", "timestamp_created": 1542907869, "timestamp_updated": 1542907869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 53, "weighted_vote_score": "0.739613890647888184", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34334338": {"recommendationid": "34334338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322624722", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507126836}, "language": "english", "review": "Best way I can describe this game?\n\nWhen you were a child being chased by a bee,\nThis is the adult version of that situation.\n\nJust that the bee is capable of picking up your whole body weight and squiring you onto a rusty meat hook, Actually it's a lot worse.\n\nRecommended, made me anxious at every turn.", "timestamp_created": 1503082030, "timestamp_updated": 1503156896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 269, "votes_funny": 240, "weighted_vote_score": "0.84149855375289917", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43757196": {"recommendationid": "43757196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129351389", "num_games_owned": 741, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 84365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 211, "last_played": 1551316416}, "language": "english", "review": "Sadly this toxic-community and their \"us vs them\" mentality is slowly killing this game. \n\n\nSurvivors:\n\nOn one hand you have the bully 4 man survivor squads that use discord to reveal all your perks, your location etc. The type of players that need every second chance perk that exists + their 3 friends equipped with flashlights to even survive a rank 20 match. \n\nA lot of these players have only one goal in mind: to \"bully\" you with their friends. May it be teabagging after every pallet they throw at you, make clicking noises with their flashlight behind you, or just try to waste your time by doing nothing but just hiding even when the exit gates are open. They do it just in hopes of frustrating you.\n\nDon't even get me started on how those players behave in the aftergame chat. There is no logic with most of them. You are still on the map if one of them got hooked = camper. One of them ran into you while he was still being hurt = tunneler. You have BBQ&Chili = hacker. You killed all 4 survivors = tryhard. You killed 3 and one escaped through the hatch = ez. The insults range from calling you a \"baby killer\" to stuff you read in other games like LoL, Dota or Overwatch.\n\nHaving those people as your team mates is also not very pleasant. Prepare to get farmed off the hook/be used as bait for the killer.\n\n\nKillers:\n\nOn the other hand you have the camping and tunneling killers that are going to defend their actions by telling you their heartbreaking stories about how often they get bullied by those 4 man groups I was just talking about before.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you play in a team or solo, because often you get camped for apparently being \"in a SWF group\", even though you were just playing by yourself. \n\nA lot of stuff in this game can make you seem \"toxic\"  like certain perks, items and playstyles which would be too much to list, but those make it right to camp and tunnel you so the match is over for you in 2 minutes, but hey: \"just do gens\" lol. Heck, I even saw posts on how the new \"Calm Spirit\" is a crutch perk and you deserve to get tunneled for it...\n\nA lot of killers will never accept that they are just as toxic as their counterpart in this game, while the survivor side pride themselves with being toxic.\n\nAlso there are few lagswitchers in this game. Since the killer is hosting the match (game is P2P and doesn't use dedicated servers) he can just freeze you on the spot and put you down by making his connection lag on purpose. Sometimes it's just very subtle and other times plain obvious, the obvious ones are that you can't move your character during chases for a longer duration until the killer has attacked you twice, but if the killer is not in a chase the connection is fine, or you are hiding far away from the killer and suddenly he hits you without standing beside you.\n\nSadly I never heard of a lagswitcher getting banned from this game and one of them even won the first official tournament in this game a couple of months ago ($5000 tournament), even though the finale was live streamed and you had the footage right there infront of you. \n\nSince that finale there are more lagswitchers than ever because they know nothing will happen to them.\n\n\nSummary:\n\nYou can't have a constructive discussion with any of them, because most people will defend their survivor/killer side to the death and are going to complain and complain about buffs and nerfs until the devs gives the side that screamed louder all that they want, which leads to major imbalance on the other side for a few months until they get what they want and then we start again...\n\nMaybe it's not the best idea to take advice from Reddit posts on how to balance this game.", "timestamp_created": 1532610637, "timestamp_updated": 1534945460, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 624, "votes_funny": 79, "weighted_vote_score": "0.81049579381942749", "comment_count": 53, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "46087135": {"recommendationid": "46087135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078193151", "num_games_owned": 627, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 58639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 146, "last_played": 1550908817}, "language": "english", "review": "hmm!!i think i need a new spacebar now ;_;", "timestamp_created": 1542844367, "timestamp_updated": 1542844367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 214, "weighted_vote_score": "0.791700839996337891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27893631": {"recommendationid": "27893631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063384244", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 154100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 531, "last_played": 1551748469}, "language": "english", "review": "Super addictive game.

You wouldn't expect on an horror game where 4 survivors have to face a brutal killer... filled with dark energy gifted from an ancient being that literally feeds on hope... the killer to be bullyed and trolled by the survivors who have easy life against said killer.\n\nWhen I say that the game is heavily survivor biased... I mean the devs (or whoever takes decisions inside BHVR). The bias is so evident that they couldn't even wait one week to announce that they were going to nerf Freddy Kruger who was already a very weak killer (probably the weakest or second weakest killer) for rank 1.\n\nBHVR comunity manager (Not_Queen) has also stated that they \"balance the game around the majority of the players\". So bad that the majority of the players are survivors on low ranks making the game completly unbalanced for rank 1 killers who have to face the biggest challenge this game has to offer... and one of the most frustrating experiences I have seen in my 20 year old videogames experience.\n\nAnother very big issue this game has not solved is the survive with friends feature.\nThis feature completly ruins the balance of the game as survivors (who normally should use perks to gain information like Empathy/kindred etc) can gain information for free using voice comunication softwares like discord or teamspeak, making the game even harder for the killer.\n\nIn conclusion my advise is:\n\nIf you are more interested in playing survivor... don't buy this game, as it will become boring after 50 hours of M1 simulator like 3/4 of the survivor games are.\n\nIf you are more interested in playing killer... absolutly don't buy this game... unless you are a very patient guy.", "timestamp_created": 1510168445, "timestamp_updated": 1510168445, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676202178001403809", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "44413171": {"recommendationid": "44413171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120202457", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 21561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 211, "last_played": 1550846253}, "language": "english", "review": "After about 250 hours of playing Dead By daylight and having it since 2016, i can say it is one of my favourite games, some people may say it's repetitive, but that's just their choice of play style, there is always different ways to play this game with different perks or even different people, that's what i like so much about Dead By Daylight.\n\nThe community of this game can be quite \"Toxic\" but on the other hand it can be equally as nice, E.g being complimented for saving someones life. However you can get some rude people, just like in every other community that calls you a camper or telling you that you suck. Every community has these types of people. sadly enough we can't change that. Not to mention it is only the start of the game where you may speak to fellow survivors or you can wait to the end of the game where you may chat to the killer aswell, there is no voice chat.\n\nWhile being a survivor your objective is to complete 5 generators and then open atleast one of the doors to escape. Usually atleast one survivor gets placed on a hook, which it is up to you or the rest of your team to save (unhook) the survivor. Depending on the player you are, you may just stick to gens, which may be bad as that may be the plan for your other team mates aswell, ending in that player on the hook dying. Being in a team of 4 and in a voice call will give you an advantage as you have communication on your side. As a survivor main, i personally like being chased and using the environment to my advantage to lose the killer, just to find him 2minutes later :).\n\nPlaying killer gives you a complete different POV as you're alone so you don't have to worry about anyone else, you can just get on with how you play without any interuptions. Your goal is to kill all 4 survivors before the gates are open using the powers the killer you picked has, to your advantage.\n\nI personally really enjoy playing this game with my close friends, it feels complete when you're playing with others, even if you're playing solo, you still get to meet new people where they may be quite nice.

It was intended to have 4 killers and that be the end of it. Since then, the development team have tried to create a kind of competitive game around core mechanics that simply do not support it.\n\nYou can play as either a team of 4 survivors who attempt to fix generators and escape, or as a killer who attempts to stop them. When the game first came out, you could only queue as a survivor solo. It was the developer\u2019s intention to make you feel isolated and alone and to further facilitate choosing between risking your life to save your fellow survivors, or to look out for number one. Several \u2018aura reading\u2019 perks were introduced that allowed you to use up one of your four precious perk slots to gain more information about your teammates and their whereabouts.\n\nThis was changed just shortly after the games release, allowing players to queue up with their friends known as survive with friends (SWF). Whilst certainly a fun and needed change, several aspects of the game have never recovered. The developers were left trying to balance the game around both solo and group players which resulted in either SWF being too strong or solo survivors being too weak (or both at the same time). Playing with friends gives an incredible advantage, knowing where the killer is, when to fix generators and make saves. Good 4-man SWF became infamous for their ability to be able to bully a killer and win consistently every single time (Just google the depip squad). Aura reading perks became redundant. Solo survivors got shafted and Killers were forced to deal with omnipotent survivors. \n\nNow as the killer, you usually have to hit a survivor twice until they are put in the dying state. You can either let them bleed out on the floor (a process which lasts 4 minutes and they are free to crawl around and get healed by teammates), or place them on a hook. Here they last 60 seconds on stage 1 where they can attempt to wiggle out, 60 seconds at stage 2 where they have to struggle to stay alive, and finally stage 3 where they die. If they get hooked after already being hooked once, they will go to the next stage, meaning at maximum 3 hooks will lead to a sacrifice.\n\nAlready I\u2019m certain you\u2019re seeing a fatal flaw with this game design. Very early on killers found that after hooking a survivor, waiting around to try and kill other survivors (a valid tactic against overly altruistic survivors) or in other cases literally just face camping (also a valid tactic but seen as incredibly bad mannered) could net them more kills. If you take a survivor out of the game early, that\u2019s one less person working on generators, which gives the killer more time to patrol and complete his or her objectives.\n\nFor a solo survivor, this can lead to a great deal of frustration when you are the first to go down and get killed right off the bat. Personally, I\u2019ve always felt this was my fault playing survivor. I did not play stealthily enough to avoid the killer nor did I run to pallets and windows fast enough to avoid being downed. However, there is a pretty significant part of the community that feels, for lack of a better word, \u2018entitled\u2019 to get unhooked and have to be hooked 3 times until they are killed. Otherwise the killer is not playing \u2018fair\u2019. It\u2019s this that I believe leads to a great deal of the toxicity found in the game. At its core, the game has mechanics that can leave players feeling \u2018cheated\u2019 out of a proper experience. \n\nMany players believe that the game is unbalanced, and a sort of \u2018unwritten code\u2019 was developed by survivors that they try to enforce on killers. Camping, face camping, Tunnelling, slugging and even taking a select few perks is frowned upon. The problem is, when you take away these strategies, all you are left with is a player who is forced to play like an NPC for the amusement of 4 random players. The game itself is not very mechanically intensive. Unless you are playing the nurse, or to a lesser extent, Hillbilly or hag, your ability to hurt the survivors is dependant on the survivors making mistakes, not you making a play. The best you can hope for is mind games around looping spots. The game is about decision making more so than mechanical play and taking away the decisions a killer can make leaves you with very few options to play. \n\nAs a killer, most games will usually go one of two ways. You can either follow this unwritten code and more times than not, survivors will teabag, taunt you and call you a baby killer at the end. Alternatively, you can show no mercy, play to the best of your ability (with the limited skill ceiling), get multiple kills, only to be flamed in the end game chat and even on your steam profile if you have not set it to private. The thing is, there is no incentive to play to these rules. Even if you do your best not to camp or tunnel, players will still accuse you of it anyway. It\u2019s become almost a meme at this point. Just look up the dead by daylight parodies on YouTube.\n\nDead by daylight is a truly fascinating example of human psychology. In most games, flaming and toxicity is directed at your teammates as they are the ones making you lose. Here it is always directed at the opponent on the opposite team. I have invaded over 1000 people on the Dark Souls games, got on to the leader boards of Total War: Warhammer, and played many other multiplayer games. In all that time I got a single comment on my profile from Dark Souls, someone calling me a sneaky ninja for killing him. We subsequently became friends. In dead by Daylight, at time of writing this review, I have 177 comments on my profile, the majority of which from survivors being angry that I didn\u2019t play a certain way or give them a chance to win. \n\nWhat I find strange is that the whole camping issue could have been quite easily fixed, if the developers were willing to throw away the hooks or at the very least, introduce an alternative game mode. One proposition I made was instead of hooks, the killer pushes the survivors down into black ooze controlled by the entity. The survivor will then be teleported to another black ooze puddle somewhere on the map that the killer has no way of knowing. Another survivor is required to rescue them from the black ooze and heal them up. This ooze could work the same way as the hooks presently do. At stage one they can attempt to escape, stage 2 they have to struggle and in stage three, are absorbed by the entity. The numbers could be tweaked as this would completely stop the biggest complaint people have about the game. Sadly, the developer\u2019s solution, instead of fixing the core of the game, was to add new perks in an attempt to apply band aids on glaring problems. \n\nWhat this achieved was creating a perk arm race of sorts. At the time of this review, there are 107 perks in the game, yet you will only see the same 15 or so over and over again as these have become both the meta, and super vital. 90% of killers at rank 1 will run Hex: ruin, usually coupled with BBQ and a couple other high tier perks. Survivors will run self-care, an exhaustion perk of some kind and then either Urban evasion, Decisive strike, We\u2019ll make it, Adrenaline, Borrowed time, or We\u2019re gonna live forever. Not only does this stifle variety and creativity, but means that skill is a lot more determined by perk than actual skill. Newer players will struggle against these perks and a great deal of grinding is required to unlock them. \n\nI had another Page and a half of review, but I\u2019m at my limit and realised it centred more on problems I had with the company. I\u2019ll leave it with this. Dead by Daylight could have been great. I only hope a competitor comes along and creates what Dead by Daylight should have been.\n", "timestamp_created": 1542600542, "timestamp_updated": 1542600904, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.74247664213180542", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34766473": {"recommendationid": "34766473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027614320", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 16813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1670, "last_played": 1551664473}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, everytime you start it up it's like playing the game for the first time.

The only thing he's guilty of is crappy internet once in awhile. He was banned for: \"we have some obscure evidence we can't disclose to you that you were changing your save file\", so 1) the mods can only see the current save file and not any old ones and 2) they don't have any proof (cause it didn't happen) so they WON'T show their evidence. Someone supposidly reported him for doing this, (assuming its someone with friends cause he never changed his save file) and it's pretty ridiculous.\n\nHe's not the only victim, there are plently of other people who have been permabanned for \"altering their save file/achievements\" when they did nothing of the sort.

If any reason exists to fear a killer the devs nerf it on the double (what did Freddy take a WEEK?) Sure, anyone can kill newbs, but this game attracts so few new players due to the community's (quite infamous) toxicity. There is also a complete lack of a way to practice the game without dealing with people who have hundreds of hours more than you bullying you regardless of role. To make matters worse there is a rank reset every month so that Tier one players end up playing against newbies every month (this is especially true in a survive with friends game). This is a very effective way to abort a new and growing player base. There is also no way to set up killer preferences to avoid SWF so ANY new killers are usually doomed to frustration instead of enjoyment.  Add in the survivor groups that use some voice chat and even experienced killers get pushed around like chumps. Don't take my word for it...look online and see for yourself. It seriously is a shame because at its core this is a really fun game. Far too many nerfs, technical isues, and more than anything toxic play to enjoy anymore.

(again see #1, disconnecting kilers, etc)\n\nKILLERS:\n-Facing a 4-man SWF loadout, though much rarer than claimed, is completely stacked against you.\n-Poor map design in terms of survivor assistance can have you running around for days after one person.\n-Rework needs to be done to assist in Killer loadouts (better Hex totem design, etc)\n-Rank Reset will have new Killers ready to uninstall the game after 20 mins. \n\n**THE GAME OVERALL**\nPROS:\n-Fun and addictive, with a learning curve that's obtainable but hardly forgiving.\n-Prestige gives you targets to aim for.\n-Some really good people in the game, and easy to make new friends in the right circumstances.\n-Tense, close matches between Survivors and Killers make the entire experience worthwhile. \n\nCONS:\n-You can get absolutely steamrolled on either side in certain matches.\n-Bugs are constantly popping up, even when one is fixed, two more show up.\n-No Region lock at all. This means you can spend 20 mins in lobbies trying to find a ping less than 200.\n-Disconnects of any nature throw the game completely off, and something needs to be worked out. \n-The community at large is toxic as hell. \n-Imbalance of Perks leads to specific Meta builds on both sides of the game, creating a very generic experience. \n-Map design needs to be reworked in order to better balance the game. (Currently in progress)\n-Certain Killers need to be reworked in order to make them viable. *cough* Freddy *cough*\n-High Ranks (1,2,3) are basically the same maps, with the same killers, and same perk loadouts on repeat.\n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS**\nThe premise and implementation of the game is great, and I understand that it's ridiculously hard to balance a game of this nature to where the majority of players are pleased. There's a reason why so many people have pumped hundreds, if not thousands, of hours into this game. The Devs are visible, they try to keep the community informed, and are always releasing new content, which is great, but I believe that more focus needs to be put into ensuring the core of the game is perfected first. If you're new, you're in for a rough ride, but it gets better, and much more enjoyable. There's alot of great aspects to the game, which makes it worth spending time in. You *will* get frustrated, you *will* have some absolutely horrible matches, but you \"Join a Lobby\" and take another stab at it. Overall, the good outweighs the bad in my opinion, and I trust the developers to keep chipping away at the monumental task that is balancing the game.", "timestamp_created": 1516720137, "timestamp_updated": 1516720137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.727509498596191406", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29331031": {"recommendationid": "29331031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019965252", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520807191}, "language": "english", "review": "I've finally deleted this game.

May it be teabagging after every pallet they throw at you, make clicking noises with their flashlight behind you, or just try to waste your time by doing nothing but just hiding even when the exit gates are open. They do it just in hopes of frustrating you.\n\nDon't even get me started on how those players behave in the aftergame chat. There is no logic with most of them. You are still on the map if one of them got hooked = camper. One of them ran into you while he was still being hurt = tunneler. You have BBQ&Chili = hacker. You killed all 4 survivors = tryhard. You killed 3 and one escaped through the hatch = ez. The insults range from calling you a \"baby killer\" to stuff you read in other games like LoL, Dota or Overwatch.\n\nHaving those people as your team mates is also not very pleasant. Prepare to get farmed off the hook/be used as bait for the killer.\n\n\nKillers :\n\nOn the other hand you have the camping and tunneling killers that are going to defend their actions by telling you their heartbreaking stories about how often they get bullied by those 4 man groups I was just talking about before.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you play in a team or solo, because often you get camped for apparently being \"in a SWF group\", even though you were just playing by yourself. \n\nA lot of stuff in this game can make you seem \"toxic\" like certain perks, items and playstyles which would be too much to list, but those make it right to camp and tunnel you so the match is over for you in 2 minutes, but hey: \"just do gens\" lol. Heck, I even saw posts on how the new \"Calm Spirit\" is a crutch perk and you deserve to get tunneled for it...\n\nA lot of killers will never accept that they are just as toxic as their counterpart in this game, while the survivor side pride themselves with being toxic.\n\nAlso there are few lagswitchers in this game. Since the killer is hosting the match (game is P2P and doesn't use dedicated servers) he can just freeze you on the spot and put you down by making his connection lag on purpose. Sometimes it's just very subtle and other times plain obvious, the obvious ones are that you can't move your character during chases for a longer duration until the killer has attacked you twice, but if the killer is not in a chase the connection is fine, or you are hiding far away from the killer and suddenly he hits you without standing beside you.\n\nSadly I never heard of a lagswitcher getting banned from this game and one of them even won the first official tournament in this game a couple of months ago ($5000 tournament), even though the finale was live streamed and you had the footage right there infront of you. \n\nSince that finale there are more lagswitchers than ever because they know nothing will happen to them.\n\n\nSummary :\n\nYou can't have a constructive discussion with any of them, because most people will defend their survivor/killer side to the death and are going to complain and complain about buffs and nerfs until the devs gives the side that screamed louder all that they want, which leads to major imbalance on the other side for a few months until they get what they want and then we start again...\n\nMaybe it's not the best idea to take advice from Reddit posts on how to balance this game.", "timestamp_created": 1535800176, "timestamp_updated": 1542835118, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 513, "votes_funny": 73, "weighted_vote_score": "0.773783028125762939", "comment_count": 83, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40043480": {"recommendationid": "40043480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038941487", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 22529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1551489381}, "language": "english", "review": "If you play survivor you'll have a difficult game, where skilled gameplay and second lasting decisions can be the difference between actually surviving, or getting yourself and possibly even a teammate killed.

I would not reccomend this game to anyone if you have any hopes about progression in the long run, since hundreds of hours of progress can dissapear just like that, and getting it back is a lost cause.\n\n*Edit - After waiting roughly six weeks, I was finally re-imbursed for the blood points that I lost, however I would have liked to see further compensation for the lengthy wait.

It's amazing value for money and has almost limitless replayability. The game was incredibly buggy and still stuffers from issues today, although the devs keep dropping patches, fixes and small gameplay tweaks to help improve things and its come a long way with many positive improvements.\n\nSadly I have to say that the game seems to have drifted into a very bad place and needs to serious work to put it back on track. Ultimately the premise of the game is based around hide and seek, where the seeker is a killer hunting for his/her prey (the survivors). These survivors are in constant fear for their lives and must try to repair generators as quickly as they can in order to power the exit gates so they can flee the killer and reach safety. This is the problem.. the contant fear just isn't there any longer, survivors simply taunt and run rings around killers often armed with a vast array of tools and perks readily at their disposal addiitonally teams of friends can communicate over voice chat giving a monoumenal tactical advantage against the killer.\n\nMajor work is needed on the game in order to bring about some balance, at the moment killers are often too powerful against newer or less skilled players. Whilst at the same time survivors become far too powerful in the late game, changes need to be included that keep the same level of fear new players experience and make escaping the killer actually challenging at all skill levels. This keep things fun for everyone its more rewarding to know you escaped when the odds were stacked against you and keeps killers engaged in the game.\n\nMoving on to DLC\n\nI've purchased all DLC so far and been quite happy with the chapters some good some average until the most recent one - Freddy krueger aka 'The Nightmare'. There was a lot of excitement around this new licenced killer and when it was released I found it to have quite a learning curve although it was very easy to track and down a single survivor it was quite tricky to manage all 4 of them and resulted in a LOT of running about in chases. Ultimatley I found him a little weak but with the right perks and techniques I could see him being a fun killer. Just ONE WEEK after release a tsunami of hatred fell upon Freddy from the survivor community calling for nerfs and complaint about him being too strong many of them being very new to the game as I mentioned earlier inexperienced players will struggle early on and shouldnt be a judge of game balance from one side.\n       The NERF hit a few weeks after release, with freddy suffering badly in all areas. Whilst the devs didn't go ahead with 100% of their initial planned nerfs the ones that they brough in were completely uneccessary and went too far destroying a paid DLC killer based on the loudest cries from the community. Freddy now stands a shadow of his former self and has become the weakest killer in the game; which is a shame as im sure he was play tested and balanced internally before all of that was just thrown away.\n\nBehavior Digital have seen the last of my money and I will no longer purchase any future DLC, I'll continue to enjoy the game playing as surivor and killer but have been burned by this recent decisions and will stick to consuming the free content thats offered with the hope that they learn lessons and attempt to put the game back on course to where it should be.\n\nIn summary:\n\nPros\n\n- Game is amazing value for money (especially in the sales)\n- Procedurally generated maps make for high replayability\n- Active development, new patches and changes\n- Open and engaging with community on development\n- New free content included not just paid DLC\n- Very active player base\n\nCons\n\n- Still major bugs in game even so long after release (including save game loses)\n- High levels of toxicity  (im looking at you post game chat)\n- Game promotes bad play styles (infinite pallet looping, hook camping)\n- Poor balance between killer and survivor (playing killer as killer at rank 1 is not fun and SWF can be a joke)\n- A round can be ruined for others when a player purposefully disconnects (which happens far too often)\n\n\nI reach rank 1 killer and rank 1 survivor after each reset and have played serveral hundred hours as both sides, hopefully that gives me a little weight behind my experiences so far in reviewing this.", "timestamp_created": 1510717531, "timestamp_updated": 1510717531, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 304, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.784287750720977783", "comment_count": 29, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28340439": {"recommendationid": "28340439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013090474", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 114522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 57, "last_played": 1551680844}, "language": "english", "review": "Trash game, with trash devs and trash community.", "timestamp_created": 1481621428, "timestamp_updated": 1516910067, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.58108222484588623", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29330877": {"recommendationid": "29330877", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965620829", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1542943704}, "language": "english", "review": "horrible matchmaking and horrible disconnect problems. also the updates don't fix anything. now to keep your rank you have to earn way more points after the update. it was at 7k points which was reasonably fair but now u derank if u can't even hit 10. yes i just played a match. the developers need to start addressing the issue as this is a common problem with disconnects and loading screen to freeze when u try to join a game. it is a great game when it works but for some reason after like midnight this games starts to lose connection all the time.", "timestamp_created": 1484717565, "timestamp_updated": 1484717565, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551692306995391846", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23624454": {"recommendationid": "23624454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012392302", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 22522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 179, "last_played": 1551148323}, "language": "english", "review": "Is it perfect? No. Is it fun? Bloody hell yes. \n\nThis game isn't going to be for everyone. Odds are you ARE going to be helpless as a suvivor. That's the point. Survivors are suppose to be helpless against a Killer. As a suvivor you don't play to win games, you play to survive them. And as a Killer you play to do one thing and only one thing, kill. If you don't like being helpless against an unstopable Killer IF he finds you, then odds are you aren't going to like Dead by Daylight. But if you are smart. Then either the Survivors or Killer can turn the odds in their favor to make fools out of the other.\n\nPros-\n-Playing as a slasher flick killer. 3 of them with more in the works.\n-Being a victim of a slasher flick. Escape death with skill, maybe just dumb luck, or die in soiled pants.\n-4v1 gameplay that goes extra lengths to make each side stand apart from the other.\n-Great use of sounds for information.\n-RNG tile based maps. 1-2 landmarks per map will aways be in the same places, but everything else will change every game.\n-Games last 10 minutes on average.\n\nCons-\n-Some model bugs like rarely seeing your own hair/eyes as a Killer or some janky movement with Killers interacting with suvivors.\n-Balance. One Killer is weaker than the other 2. Windows close together can make near 100% safe zones for survivors depending on a few things. Some perks are rather annoying, maybe a touch OP.\n-Games have no timers. If someone wants to waste your time, they can if they are good enough.\n-No communication. It is impossible to talk to each other without 3rd party chats like Steam, Teamspeak, Skype, ect.\n-Making a lobby as a Killer can take up to 10 minutes to fill. Not from player counts mind you. Either another bug or a waiting list with strict \"first come, first filled\" rules.\n\nIn short-\n\nFor $20 you are going to get one hell of a fun game!

TOXCICITY\nThis fanbase is extremely toxic, securing a kill as a killer, referred to as \"camping\" and \"tunneling\" will get some tasty -rep's and comments on your profile, just check out mine.\nPeople are very toxic in endgame chat, especially if you are the killer. \nThis is one of the main reasons, that if you aren't thick-skinned, you shouldn't buy this game.\n\n2. KILLER GAMEPLAY\nYou'd think, that killers would be the powerful and have control in the game but that's far from true. To sum it up, the time it takes to complete a generator is very short when compared to how long a chase takes. Furtherly, it takes very long for many killers to move around the map, meaning that you often come to a generator and it gets finished in front of your face. Many weaker killers do not have enough time to catch and kill survivors.\n\nThis all combined makes playing any killer except the \"Hillbilly\", \"Nurse\" and \"Hag\" (the three best killers in the game) a chore, and even as the two best killers, you need to spend hundreds of hours mastering them unless you want to be \"bullied\" by the survivors. \n\nThe worst thing here is the \"SWF\" I mentioned before, combining the amount of time pallets can waste, along with perfectly communicating where you are, what perks you are using and what killer you are, it's very painful.\n\n\n3. SURVIVOR GAMEPLAY\nPlaying survivor however, without SWF or the \"Perks\" I mentioned earlier (perks are things you can equip on your character which give you special abilities like 150% faster movement speed for 3 seconds) playing survivor is a chore too, since the killer has perks which makes finding you easier, and since stealth is very hard to pull of because of how maps are designed, you have to \"pallet loop\" (going pallet to pallet to waste as much time as possible) while your teammates (hopefully) do gens. If you're not being chased, you have to hold down M1 for 80 seconds to complete a generator (boring). \n\nIf the killer doesn't give up on you, downs you and the exit gates are open, then you're basically dead unless you're teammates decide to come for you and have the perk \"Borrowed Time\".\n\nUntil you \"level up\" all your survivors to get the perks, or play with SWF and communication devices like Discord, the game will not be the most fun. \n(Edit: you now start with your characters perks and finishing the tutorial gives you enough bloodpoints to level up a bit)\n\nFurtherly your teammates will often have 3 braincells, unhooking you infront of the killer (reffered to as farming), is quite common. If your teammates can't loop, you might have to take the agression yourself so you don't have a 1v1 on your hands, or do two gens and hope for hatch-game.\n\n\n5. THE DEVS\nIt feels like they don't listen. They just nerfed a balanced perk named \"BBQ and Chilli\", which was often used on killers. This perk incentivized leaving the hook after you hook a survivor, meaning that less people camped so that the game was more fun on both side. It feels like they don't play their own game, as they've released multiple trash killers (Clown, Legion), along with their perks being horrible. \n\n6. THE LEGION\nWowie, a new killer, the Legion. Guess what? He's trash. He has a lower base movement speed and his ability forces him to hit a survivor 4 times to down them. He has nearly no chase, even Clown without addons would be better than him. His design is generic, his special perks are trash. It feels like he was extremely rush. And instead of buffing him by making a currently meta (very good) perk work better on him, they opted to nerf another weak killer (Doctor) instead by making said meta perk no longer work on him.\n\n7. THE HATCH\nI've forgotten to include this in my original review, but I might as well add it now. After two gens have been done and three survivors have been killed, the hatch will spawn and open. A survivor can jump into the hatch to escape, but while jumping he or she can be grabbed and put onto the killer's shoulder.\nIf both sides come to the hatch at the same time or the killer finds it first, the killer and survivor will be forced to stare at eachother if they want to win, as acting (hitting the survivor or jumping in) will result in the loss for the side acting. This can lead to \"hatch stand-offs\" lasting between 5 minutes to an hour, it's boring and has been a problem since the game started and it still hasn't been fixed.\n\n\n\n8. TO SUM IT UP\nThis game CAN be very fun if you are playing with friends, especially in \"KYF\" (Kill your Friends).\nHowever, playing killer without the strongest perks and the best killers is a chore and really unfun, unless you're playing with brain-dead survivors.\nPlaying survivor without the strongest perks is okay-ish, but nothing special due to the ease in survival.\n\nDon't buy it for now, but keep a close eye for the next few updates.\n(I said this like 6 months ago lmao^)\n\nEdit 8: finally updated the review again, removed and added a few points, revised others.", "timestamp_created": 1521283501, "timestamp_updated": 1544531535, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736235618591308594", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42851277": {"recommendationid": "42851277", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990417287", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 20971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1551657832}, "language": "english", "review": "Unique and original concept with some ever increasingly bad flaws\n\nPros\n-best co-op action in a game\n-endless fun\n-randomized level designs\n\nCons\n-camping killers can ruin the experience\n-teammates can farm of you while leaving you stranded or to die\n-no dedicated servers (host can willingly lag everyone else in the game)\n\nDead by daylight has the most original concept for a game I have played in an extremely long time. You are a team of four survivors playing in 3rd person camera angle. You do not have any weapons and must work together in randomized level designs to activate 5 generators followed by unlocking the exit gate. You are also able to access an escape hatch if you have gotten 3/5 generators or are the last survivor remaining. While doing these task you must avoid the killer (1st person camera angle) who is attemping to hook you 1-3 times depending on if your teammates are able to save you (maximum of twice, dead on the 3rd hook). Each character (survivor and killer) has their own unique perks and become teachable amongst all the survivors.\n\n    The problem with the game is killers are able to camp a hooked survivor and purposely lag the game for the other players, thus ruining the experience. Along with this the game has a bunch of bugs and glitches. Ever since the latest patch they have clearly shown favor in introducing cosmetics via micro transactions and less priority towards balancing the stability of the game. A new bug has emerged that will sometimes make your character unable to move (sometimes for the whole match) along with killers being able to hit you through a pallet it claims you stunned them with. One of the bigger issues I hate is if the killer (host) disconnects before the match even loads, your offerings will be consumed regardless of the match not even starting. In some instances this can also result in you loosing rank progress (PIP) without any control.\n\n   Conclusion: The game is extremely fun and truly shines if you have a full team of friends to play and communicate with. Just be willing to except the occasional camping killer and glitches every so often. I would recommend buying the game but perhaps holding off on the DLC and other microtransactions (auric cells) until the devs put some of this money they made into fixing the stability of the game.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1529445064, "timestamp_updated": 1529445064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 82, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.775559961795806885", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28803390": {"recommendationid": "28803390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008959549", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513982636}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun game..

On the other hand, it's a multiplayer game with a majorly toxic community, between people quitting games, complaining about the killers or the perks used, or complaining about the survivors, it's endlessly problematic, BUT, there are some nice and chill people as well, I've had the worst and the best experiences, so it's mostly a luck based draw, your teammates may be awesome, and they may be ragequitters, the killer can be really fun and challenging, or he can be a real camper that gets lucky with its hitbox, you never know.\nThe gameplay is solid, you play either as a survivor, which need to coordinate with other survivors to repair generators, so the doors unlock and you can escape the map.
