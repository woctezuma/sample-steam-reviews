In terms of story and characters, this is my favorite Rockstar title in that aspect. You really relate to the characters, you fear for them, they're funny but slip in enough drama, and they all interact with each other excellently. The open world is also a great achievement in this series. The dirty, ugly New York parody known as Liberty City is far more engaging than other titles, and it still feels real enough to work. The way the world interacts with the player really sells this as a functioning world.\n\nThe missions get a bit repetitive, and like other Rockstar games, it sometimes feels like there's too many characters to keep track of later in the game, and it has a finale that doesn't feel entirely special from a gameplay standpoint. The gameplay is also a bit clunkier than other games compared to today. The cars behave more \"realistically\" and less arcade-like such as Grand Theft Auto V, as well as some weapons. It feels a bit like some fun was sacrificed for realism, but not enough to make me stop playing, I still enjoyed it. The graphics haven't aged all that well either. Some aspects still look pretty decent, but some of the character models and closeups definitely reek of the time, but that's easy to get past.\n\nThe multiplayer mode used to be some of the most fun you could have online at the time. Your experience wasn't a necessary grind and not everybody was a tryhard jerk like in Grand Theft Auto V. However, it is hard to find enough players that you used to be able to years ago. It is a sad loss and that era has passed, so if you haven't played that, it does feel like you missed out.\n\nI highly recommend Grand Theft Auto IV for the story and tone.

You're looking at a title serving as a solid example of budding practices from the last generation, except made by Rockstar so it has that level of attention and care they're known for. Still, expect brown & bloom everywhere paired with very acquired taste driving mechanics and a cover system too sticky for its own good. It is not a bad game and definitely has impressive elements like Euphoria usage, but overall there are too many strikes against it and minor annoyances unless you really want to see the leap series made from its PS2 days. I would argue most of those leaps were backwards despite impressive production, but that's just me.\n\n[h1] Full Review [/h1] \nGrand Theft Auto 4 s probably one of those games I should've reviewed years ago when I first played it, but I also imagine it would've been received much worse considering the state of the PC version. While I'm on the subject it's only fair to emphasize I modded the game with GTA4 Reborn mod which largely handles all the [now] leftover GfWL/XBox Live issues, bug fixes and restored some content like all the songs Rockstar in their expiring licenses wisdom saw fit to remove. Real question is how much can you fix a game that has such deep core issues related to its platform and does it stand the test of time after a decade of open world progress? Well... let's find out, cousin.\n\nFollowing my usual format story is up first, but honestly if you have any GTA experience you can kinda tell where it's going \u2013 start from rags and become a very rich person or disappear anonymously.\n\nThis fourth installment does its own thing with a certain twist ending, but that's clearly spoiler territory so we won't go there. In any case, we assume the role of Niko Belic escaping his history concerning Yugoslav Wars shenanigans and who has some pretty bitter memories on the matter as he finds his way to Liberty City where his famed cousin Roman is living the high life. Except it all ends up being fanciful tales considering he barely owns a taxi service and has to deal with pushy Russian mobsters. Well, NB being the protagonist that he is, things certainly take a turn following his arrival and it's not long before he gets to pursue a certain obsession that has essentially ruined his life \u2013 track down the person who betrayed him back during the war and got his other friends killed in the process of selling them all out. This becomes the protagonist's primary motivation when you're not being an errand boy for everyone under the sun with their greed and need.\n\nWhich is already where my problems start to rear their ugly head. Story in GTA4 isn't really that good and never goes beyond the basic level it starts out. That department is carried more by whether you care about the main cast or not... which could be said about all the Grand Theft Autos from 3 onward, though. And I do care about Niko. Roman less so, but they make for a great dynamic duo until the game kinda forgets about them after the first third or so after which you get mired neck deep in the affairs of organized crime simply because you want to get paid. I'll touch on this more when I get to discussing actual systems and gameplay. Let's just say you're not really working for all that useful payout, so real currency you're looking for are interesting character stories. GTA4 thankfully delivers on those in spades even if they end up being little more than criminal/national stereotypes at their core. From your friendly Rastafari masquerading as a mobile weapon shop to myriad of Italian/Russian/Irish gangsters and other small time pushers. They all have missions that desperately require someone to solve them and you happen to be available. I would like to point out there are story choices on multiple occasions, but only the very last one truly matters in a sense it determines the ending. Meaning it's not some extensive investment to see both of them unfold.\n\nI feel like any city GTA game is set in almost acts as if it were a character in its own right so Liberty City deserves some attention. Definitely not one of my favorites. It goes without saying the city is based on New York City, albeit representing four out of five boroughs, but I'm not a fan of it being so heavily urbanized and split onto islands. Meaning you're always crossing bridges and I can only assume it may have something to do with hiding loading times because it ended up annoying me and just taking taxis to distant locations was far easier than driving there myself. That's a problem in a game where hijacking cars and driving are both kind of a big deal.\n\nWhile I'm on the subject I might as well transition into gameplay itself.\n\nBefore anything else is said there's a HUGE elephant in the room that has to be addressed \u2013 driving physics. I cannot emphasize strongly enough how mad they drove me and were going to play a major role in rating GTA4 negatively as I set out to play the game even back in the day. Until they just stopped annoying me one day as I realized it simply took time to, as kids say these day, \u201cget good\u201d at driving. Not all cars were manufactured equal and you really end up looking for those better, premium cars that handle better overall. Where game makes a misstep is missing any form of car customization past getting a new paint job. I feel like at least some of the inherent problems with these driving physics, where most cars handle like tanks trying to ice skate, could have been alleviated with customization where you get to tweak things like breaks, suspension, etc. Alas such system is absent from the game and it takes a while until good cars become easily available. Thankfully, you can at least store them in front of your apartment(s). It is worth noting there are also bikes, helicopters and boats in the game with airplanes being suspiciously absent. Less said about helicopter controls the better. I just don't get what is it with Rockstar and helicopter controls, but there was little fun to be found in matching altitude while dodging rockets and trying to hit my target with the machine gun simultaneously.\n\nSecond-most thing you'll be doing is shooting, naturally. This entry sees the first modern implementation of a sticky system for the series and naturally there were some bumps left to iron out in the future. After pressing the cover button Niko will stick to the nearest viable cover from which you can then shoot wildly or take aim for more accurate shots. Standard fare for modern TPS so far. My problem with the system was this weird [lack of] accuracy if you take your time to aim shots because you kinda have to take into account Niko has to make a move to \u201cstep out\u201d of the cover to actually fire which throws off your aim. It's something you learn to compensate for, but bullets basically won't be landing precisely where you've aimed them at. Speaking of movement this ties into the way protagonist moves about as GTA4 embraces that slow, almost weight-based movement some don't like. I didn't mind it, but it certainly takes a while to get used to coming from snappy arcade approach of older 3D titles in the series. One thing I do not like is walking being the game's default movement speed and having to constantly keep a button pressed to run or, god help us, mash the button to sprint. Analog sticks were in use so why couldn't have that range of motion been used instead? At least basic running. It comes off as one of many pet peeves it would probably take Rockstar a game or two to figure out fully.\n\nEarlier I spoke about how money isn't really your reward for doing things in the game.

But I'm still going to leave this review to warn others ot the negative experiences I had with this game, the amount of things I had to do should not have been necessary.

The characters, the atmosphere, and the backstory all blend together to make a great story. I like the story a lot more than GTA V, because I feel like there's more substance to the game. Niko Bellic is not a bad person on the inside. He's a tortured soul that's been through a lot, and the only reason he does what he does is to stay alive so he can make it out of the pits that he was forced into. in GTA V, it's really just another heist story that doesn't exactly have a deep plot. Also, I'm a sucker for mafia stories, and no GTA has done the whole mob story scheme better than GTA IV.\n\nGameplay/Physics:\n\nGameplay-wise, this is also probably my favorite out of all the Grand Theft Autos, primarily because it seems the most realistic out of all the games. The only thing that I could see people complaining about is the way that cars handle in this game, but honestly after a while it's really fun once you get the hang of it (This is coming from a guy who loves drift racing games. If you hate drifting, you're gonna hate the driving in this game) The car physics are amazing. The crumple points are super realistic compared to GTA V. Even the sound effects when you hit another car is super realistic. (I've been in a car accident before, and I've seen them happen, I know the sound.) The combat is also fantastic. This is the only GTA where the combat feels almost real. The AI is a lot smarter than in GTA V. When you shoot an enemy, they don't just flinch, they look like they actually got hit. They'll drop, they'll stagger backwards, they'll fall over, they'll put their hand where they just got shot. Much of the time enemies will limp away if you get them to the lowest health. In GTA V it seems a lot more like any other third person shooter, where they just flinch for a second and get up and start shooting again.\n\nMultiplayer (and arguably the driving) is the only thing I can say GTA V did better, but if it had the physics and gameplay of GTA IV, you would instantly have the best GTA possible. The main problem with the GTA IV Multiplayer is that it just feels kinda pointless, you don't really work towards anything.\n\nThe only con that I can give this game for the PC is the fact that you need Windows Live to play it. I have never liked Windows Live, and I find it stupid that I'm forced to use it. However, that can't stop me from giving this game a positive review, because this really is one of my favorite games ever created.\n\n9.5/10!", "timestamp_created": 1513458753, "timestamp_updated": 1543000570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 99, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.880405902862548828", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23236045": {"recommendationid": "23236045", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996036270", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548976318}, "language": "english", "review": "HOLY SHIT, EVERYONE CALM DOWN!!!!!\n\nA bunch of people are giving this game bad reviews because they can't start the game (Because they have windows 10).

Time is not standing still, you know and Rockstar and Steam are not helping a lot. This is how i got the game running on windows 10 based on forum readings and own experiments.\nFirst of all thanks to anyone for posts and helping each other out on this one.\n1. Download software\n2. Start the game, click on desktop icon\n3. Steam will install necessary files like Direct X - Windows LIVE - Securom protection\n4. You will be asked to login to Rockstars Social Club, ignore this and exit / return to desktop\n5. Go to your steam game folder and rename the file paul.dll to paul.old, this way you will\nbe never prompted again to login to Rockstars Social Club. You also can delete this paul.dll file\nbut one never knows if a decent update appears and paul.dll is necessary again.\n6. As told in point 3, steam installed Windows LIVE but this is not supported anymore by Microsoft\nand you will need to have it installed to start the game. Install Games for windows Marketplace, see link    http://www.xbox.com/en-us/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient\n7. Start the GTAIV again by clicking on the desktop icon.\n8. You will be asked to make an account on Windows Marketplace (mail and password required), do so as it is needed to save the game and store achievements. \n9. You are also asked to submit the serial key number which is provided by steam.\n10. And to have a gamertag on Xbox live. If not create one (mail and password required) via starting the app Xbox in windows 10 after exiting the game. (i guess this app is also available in win 7 / 8). If not, here to find     http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-app\n11. And there you go with the game.....for the lucky ones.\n12. If you have a graphic card with more then 2GB memory, as I do, you're ingame graphic options are all set to minimum and can not be changed.\n13. Right-click on GTA 4 under the Steam Library and select properties.\n14. Under the general tab, click the set launch options button.\n15. Enter the launch options you wish to apply (be sure to separate each code with a space) and click OK. For GTA 4 it is:       -nomemrestrict -norestrictions\n16. Close the game's Properties window and launch the game.\n17. Now, you can set your graphic options to it's max.\n\nAuch, it start's with a SM scene, anyway, less painfull then getting the game installed.\nThe last mission (helicopter) is painfull as well, it has a glitch.\nThere is a workaround on the internet (use FRAPS & record settubg @ 30 fps) but hell, Rockstar where are you ??", "timestamp_created": 1471704277, "timestamp_updated": 1484496930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.865267336368560791", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36623196": {"recommendationid": "36623196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165798937", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 3115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "last_played": 1551632419}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]GTA IV > GTA V[/h1]\n\nThe reason I like GTA IV more than GTA V has nothing to do with the gameplay or graphics.\n\nNiko Beli\u0107 is the only character in the GTA series that not wanted to be criminal.

Rockstar Games doesn't seem to care about that. You just can't fix them all but you could definetely make the game playable in the best possible manner.\n\n-This game works absolutely fine on Windows 10, 8.1 and 8 but it just isn't optimized for modern PCs. I'd recommend to play this game on Windows XP (Sp3) or Windows Vista compability mode from properties of GTAIV executable (Launcher.exe) \n\n-Game For Windows Live client needs to be manually installed from xbox site.\n\n-If you don't want to play multiplayer or don't want Game For Windows Live then simply install x-llive-leess dll (censored by Steam) files on the game directory folder.\n\n-The Steam default version of the game which is the latest version of GTAIV (1.0.8.0) released in December 2016 does not support any kinds of MODs so please don't install any MOD without downgrading your game or it will probably break your game and mess up with your game files. \nAlways create a back-up copy for safety. If you want to run MODS in GTAIV then you must downgrade and install patch 1.0.4.0 for best performance that was released in 2008. Some MODS also work on 1.0.7.0 that was released in 2010. Patches are to be manually installed from Rockstar Games official website (search on web) \n\n-Check out community guides for bug fixes, patches, xlivless tool to disable GFWL. Check out awesome mods on YouTube.\n\n-I hold no credit to any of the fixes mentioned above and hold no guarantee that this would work \n for everyone. It just works 95% times.

Why?\nThe procedure is the usual, we download and we get a serial key. Fine. Start the game and first thing we have to do is login with a Rockstar Social Club. Which I still believe has no reason to exist, but since this is their game I can live with it... Until their own launcher doesn't let me log in many random times for unknown reasons. Luckily it's necessary for online games only so I skip that passage as I'm not interested. Fine let's play! NO. Now you have to face Games for Windows Live, a dead platform badly working which You need TO MANUALLY UPDATE FIRST, because NOBODY EVER THOUGHT OF DOING IT WHEN THE PLATFORM DIED, then it pretends your login and your serial code. OK, I'm almost running out of patience here but many games on steam require further registration with another platform (uPlay, Origin...), so ok. Then it's mayhem. I've read about A WHOLE LOT of people with this same issue: I've bought a 4-pack so I've registered all my serials on my account and all my friends' except for one which isn't recognized. There's NO WAY to get a solution for this (and I'm NOT even considering the trick where you're supposed to buy Episodes from liberty city to use its serial as GTA IV serial because I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BUY MORE TO USE WHAT I'VE ALREADY PAID FOR). Steam isn't responsible and claims it's rockstar or microsoft issue, Microsoft doesn't even have a number to call as GFWL is dead, Rockstar doesn't care and I've only read of just one user that came out of this by threatening Rockstar of SUING THEM and after a VEEERY long time he got a new serial.\nAfter all these troubles IF we're lucky we can get to the game... Or maybe not. Obviously On modern systems there HAS to be issues as The game allows to change your graphic Details ONLY IF it detects enough VRAM.Too bad that it doesn't recognize anything at all. Luckily A couple of command strings SHOULD be enough to bypass that problem. Let's press the \"Play\" button... Loading...Loading...Loading... REALLY?!?!? Luckily seems like another command strings solve that problem as well, but it's really ridiculous considering all the money they got they didn't support nor fixed any of these problems.\n\n[*][b]GTA IV (as a Game)[/b]\n\nAnyways, after a good dose of patience and luck, once inside the game it gives some satisfaction. I've played the whole franchise since the first GTA (except for london) so I've seen the evolution of the games and I have to say this chapter is a huge leap forward.\nThe gameplay is basically the same, third person action, you can do almost anything you want but if you want to follow the story and the missions it can be summarized as Running, shooting, stealing cars and drive away. In this chapter the gameplay introduces the cover systems which kind of helps in difficult situations and shootings. What makes the game particular is the really big map, a lively city with so many things to do, which means huge replayability. Liberty City is split in various \"islands\" connected with bridges... Closed at the beginning, as usual and there are the usual stores, spray'n'go, weapons and so on. Besides that there are also reastaurants, fast food, clothes shops and similar, among with the new leisure activities, such as bowling, strip clubs, cabaret and whatever, used mainly to maintain your reputation with friends and girlfriends. Yes, you can choose to date girls, and go out with friends which will call you anytime on your ingame mobile to invite you somewhere, and wether you accept or not it will influence the \"level of friendship\", which is kind of important as once you reach the top level they can help you out with their own abilities (call a cab, car bombs, weapons and more). Important or not it can be kind of annoying as girlfriends will always look at your clothes which you must change often and choose carefully according to their taste, and friends will often call to invite you... quite often... At any time... even while you're on mission or already out with someone else...\nAnyways, Looks like Rockstar did a really good job with the story as well, which was to be expected, but now they've taken everything to the next level with their new graphic engine with good direction skills and by taking good shots. You also have to make a choice towards the end and this will lead to two very different endings. [spoiler]And they're both quite bitter if I may say [/spoiler]but I really liked the story anyways.\nThe new engine does its job and shows the beauties of liberty city. Of course sometimes there are the usual glitches where some map elements are loaded later, or maybe sometimes the game will show on the road only massive copies of your own car but besides that everything is ok.\nThere are few new things I really liked, such as buildings in the city... Meaning you can get inside various buildings, so this time you don't have a city made of impenetrable cubes. Of course most of them are accessible during missions but it gave a nice variation to the gameplay and locations. There's a TON of radio stations, and I love all of them, just like in the previous games, of course. And last thing is something I kind of liked and hated at the same time: the \"police wanted system\". Once you get the police attention you have to get out of an area of interest whose limits are determined by nearby units that have you onsight. Which is good... And hard to do at the same time as it's quite hard to shake off the units behind AND avoid the large quantity of units incoming ahead of you, which means they will keep you busy with long pursuit sessions before you can shake them off... Especially if you get the attention of choppers.\nOne last thing that really took me some time to get used to is car physics... I mean, it's kind of hard and odd to drive them. Honestly, I don't care too much if it's more realistic than the older games or GTA V, but I can say all the cars are hard to handle, they don't steer enough, Handbrake makes you totally lose control, but after some hours of game I kind of got used to it... Not without some difficulty anyways. \n[/list]\n[h1]---PROs---[/h1][list]\n[*][b] GAMEPLAY.[/b] It's GTA, one generation ahead of the trilogy. Many additions and improvements to the game giving you lots of activities to do besides the main campaign.\n[*][b] LIBERTY CITY.[/b] A very big city with lots of places, activities, people around, doing things, everything is really lively in that place. And everythin is built with lot of dedication and care for details. Even rides in Trains have a panoramic cinematic, or rides in taxis with lots of dialogues with the driver.\n[*][b] STORY.[/b] Story is never to be underestimated in any GTA chapter and this here makes no exception.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]---CONs---[/h1][list]\n[*][b] SERIAL ACTIVATION.[/b] The biggest flaw with this game is the high chance to fail registering your own Legit Serial Key AND the total lack of assistence. Not to mention the fact that you need to update your Games For Windows Live manually and the Rockstar Social Club randomly doesn't let you log in. THIS is the reason I downvoted this product.\n[*][b] COMPATIBILITY ISSUES.[/b] It has some issues with modern hardware and modern OS and there's no official patch for this. Luckily there's always the steam community that helped me run GTA IV on my Laptop with Win 10 x64 and a Integrated nVidia GPU.\n[*][b] CARS.[/b] Maybe it's me but I never got used to the car physics, they're quite hard to handle as they never steer enough and you can lose control too easily with handbrake.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1462191117, "timestamp_updated": 1548888867, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 98, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.857618331909179688", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "41701536": {"recommendationid": "41701536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051220455", "num_games_owned": 2999, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513095857}, "language": "english", "review": "They can't (or won't) update the game to not include GFWL, a broken mess of a DRM. \nBut when it comes to removing content (music), that's no issue.

I KILLED PEOPLE, SMUGGLED PEOPLE, SOLD PEOPLE.\"[/i][/b]\n\nEverybody was looking forward to 3rd December 2008. The release day of PC version of Grand Theft Auto IV. 2 years later, I found out that some GTA IV exists, when I saw \"Move Up Ladies\" trailer. Back in 2010 I used to run on Windows XP Service Pack 1. I had to upgrade. SP3 was needed. I never upgraded, and when I did month before to W7 I ruined that. I can't exactly remember how it all went down, but all I remember is, that mother cooked me soup, and while the computer was installing Service Pack 3, I was inpatiently waiting in the kitchen eating that bomb soup. Full of excitement I came to my room and that glorious legendary Windows XP background was shining at me and I immidiately started screaming \"OH YES OH YES OH YEEEEEEES\". \nAfter that, there was absolute silence in my room for a week. Why? Because I was playing Grand Theft Auto IV.\n\nNow, we all know that it's legendary and before GTA V it was totem to most of the gamers who managed to run it. That optimalization was and is problem to lot of gamers, but it all was a price of the revolution. Maybe, I didn't say it correctly, because [b]revolution is change of something and after that it follows. But no game was able to follow GTA IV.[/b]\n\nPhysics was totally heaven. It was like from another planet. Just imagine, 9 freaking years ago, game like GTA IV was out. That game didn't even had competition. Still I'm not sure if there's game close to that physics that we were introduced to back in 2008. Yeah I know GTA V bla bla bla bla. Sound, graphics, story, visuals, city, just every everything was new level. \n\nStorytelling and dialogues are gripping as hell. It's really deep and intense, with absolute dedication to detail. Liberty City is dark and so is story. Liberty City is beautiful, sad, sombrely. New York in your hands. Everybody has to play it at least once, so I believe there's no need of going into the story, and if so, I'll just tell you to play it because you won't regret it.\n\nRecent update helped a game a bit, but modders used to downgrade. Mods extend the gaming experience. Game will last you easily around 30 hours. It's highly replayable. I can't even count how many times I've finished that. Easily over 10 times. Multiplayer was and is just a bonus addition. Nothing big, nothing real. GFWL sucks, everybody agrees with that. \n\nGame expansions have been already reviewed so you can check it in my profile. If I forget about anything, let me know please. To sum it up - legendary game that everybody must finish with amazing story and storytelling, awesome visual and physics and great overal gaming experience. \n\n[b]Bonus Point: Soup from my mother[/b]\n[h1]Rating: 9.5/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1487515277, "timestamp_updated": 1494106566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 122, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.830024003982543945", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42744179": {"recommendationid": "42744179", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979785007", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1543609934}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought a physical copy of the game back in 2008.

The artificial intelligence has still some flaws (for example, in some missions where a gunfight was required to happen, the allies sometimes exposed themselves to the enemy fire without even caring to find a cover, causing in this way several time the mission to fail).

I haven\u2019t played online because I wasn\u2019t interested to it, so I do not know if the online functionalities work as they should.\n    [*]The fighting mechanics have been completely changed and became definitely more realistic. It can be hard at the start to learn, but once you get used to it, its benefits appear quite clearly, especially the aiming system that has been finally improved and made comfortable for keyboard and mouse players. \n    [*]The artificial intelligence has generally been definitely improved in every kind of possible behaviour.\n    [*]Even if they are few - very few (four, max five), there are some not violent, but very, very cruel scenes.

The first thing that you are gonna wanna do is check how much vram you graphics card has if you have atleast 2gigs of vram you should be able to play on max settings if you have anything lower then 2gigs your card is most likely not good enough to play the game in max settings anyway.\n\n2. Once you figure out how much vram your card has you want to open up your steam library find grandtheft auto 4 right click it and open up properties this should pull up a tab that has a button that says set launch options click that and type in these commands.\n\n-nomemrestrict -norestrictions -availablevidmem what ever you vram amount is \n\nMy commands would look like this -nomemrestrict -norestrictions -availablevidmem 8000.0 because my card has 8 gigs of vram IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU PUT THE .0 AFTER THE NUMBER.\n\n3. Then click ok and then launch the game and you should be able to turn the graphics ssettings to max without seeing through the map or having any other big graphical errors i have noticed a little texture popping here and there but i think that just might be a gta problem and not a you problem.\n\n\nIf this does not work for you use the other fix down below it should work for most people\n\nOLD FIX\n \nIf you are having problems with floating textures or being able to see through the map and want to play on max settings set you graphical settings to\n\nResolution - whatever you want\nTexture Quaiilty - High \nReflection Quaility Very High\nShadow Quailty - High\nNight Shadows - Very High\nTexture Filter - X16\nView Distance - 25 \nDetail Distance - 31\nvehicle Density - 100\nDefinition - On\nVsync - What Ever you want.

Unfortunately, this is exactly how Rockstar operates -- and Steam shoulders some of the blame.\n\nI recently found that an incredible amount of in-game music had been gutted via an update. This came a short time after another patch completely disabled the ability to use a wide variety of mods that had previously improved both the single-player and multi-player experiences. Why prevent players from using mods in a 10 year old game whose remaining online community exists to use said mods? (Note that outside of beta updates, Steam makes no distinction between mandatory and optional updates, and you must manually opt out of automatic updates. Even if automatic updates had been disabled, there would be no way to know that the update was anything but a security or stability patch.) \n\nI don't care what's in the EULA, and I don't care what's in the fine print [in regards to this issue]. I also don't care what sorts of deals Rockstar initially made with music distributors.  Why? Because a consumer should never have to read the fine print to disabuse themselves of the misleading or outright false language that's in the large print. When I bought this game on Steam, I clicked the \"Buy\" button. Not the \"Rent\" button. Not the \"Subscribe\" button. I reasonably expected to have the rights that come with owning a product. \n\nI have never before bought a product only to have its creator intentionally damage said product in multiple demonstrable ways well after the purchase was made. In what world is this not tantamount to bait-and-switch of the most egregious order? Class-action, anybody?\n\n\nWith regards to the game itself...\n\nPerformance: \nIt's a technical mess on PC -- very poorly optimized on any machine if you can even get it to start. Do not expect to sustain 60fps on any graphics setting, regardless of your specs. \n\nSingle-player:\nThe single-player campaign is eclipsed by most similar open-world games (I personally recommend Sleeping Dogs for a similar but higher-quality campaign). If you think unrealistically gratuitous foul language and half-assed sociopolitical commentary are cool and edgy, you'll appreciate GTA4's story and world.\n\nMulti-player:\nThe multi-player Free Mode is a blast, and would definitely be good enough to justify the purchase under normal circumstances. Unfortunately, Rockstar's double-layer Social Club / Windows Live online system is thoroughly undependable, and has been broken for months at a time on multiple occasions over the past few years (and who knows how much longer the online servers will be sustained, anyways?). This leaves only LAN play. Given the way things have been going -- disabled mods, removal of large amounts of content -- I would not be surprised to see GTA4's LAN multiplayer removed in future updates, presumably to force any remaining playerbase into the cluster that is GTA5 Online.\n\n\nTLDR; Rockstar is an egregiously bad, likely legally culpable company. From intentionally damaging consumers' purchased products years after the point of sale (GTA4 and GTA5), to banning multitudes of players from online play with no explanation given (GTA5), you simply shouldn't buy from Rockstar unless you actively enjoy getting ripped off.", "timestamp_created": 1526419796, "timestamp_updated": 1526425278, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758811473846435547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40605048": {"recommendationid": "40605048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100945453", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 6335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 567, "last_played": 1551518129}, "language": "english", "review": "GTA IV is not bad game as many would say, it was just bad port at the end, yet it has little to no bugs (no bugs or issues experienced so far), and performance is good, as long as you don't overreact with settings.

I don't care about those graphics, the details, or the online features of GTA V, the gameplay and storyline of GTA IV will always remain the best. This game has the most beautiful production of all the games in the series. The characters are brilliantly executed, the environment and feel of the game is so realistic. (Don't mind the AI or the other GTA-like features) and the game makes you feel so elevated. Then why are there so many negative reviews?\n\nIf you are reading this anytime in the 2019+, this game has mixed reviews (at least since 2013). And let me tell you why:\n\nUp till now, my review has only been restricted to the game-play, but let's talk about the way this port was implemented for the PC. First of all, the port uses the age old GFWL DRM. And it doesn't work. That's it. It just doesn't work anymore.\n\nThe next thing is that this game is 32-bit, and uses only up-to 4 GB of memory. So, any hardware above a mid-range laptop will run the game exactly the same. Even if you have a 2080 Ti or a monster rig, it will run only as good.\n\nBUT, even if it [i]DOES[/i] run well, there are chances of the game crashing and being buggy, because if the cut-scenes reach 60 FPS, everything will be zoomed in like looking through a magnifying glass. And it is irritating and may crash the game too!\n\nNot only that, the part that hit me the most is the way the expansion packs (or DLCs) have been implemented. Unlike the regular GFWL version, the DLCs come as a separate game, making the integration with GTA IV impossible. Which means no synced save files, no extra radio stations and no smooth transitions. This (personally) made me very mad.\n\nThen, to top it all, they (Rockstar) disable custom mods in the latest update, version 1.0.8.0 of the game.\n\nThere are also many in-game bugs and optimization failures that you may notice once you start playing it, but nonetheless, if you haven't played the game before, disregard everything I just said above and play it. There have been some fixes released and the game can be playable, but, for me, it ran pretty smooth (I own a very low-end rig, so no complains). And play it before there are too many technological advances your hardware can support it no more.\n\nLet me just end by saying this: Don't miss this game for the world. All that I found missing in GTA V, I found in this game. I did play GTA IV a long time ago, but only after playing GTA V, I realized it's value.\n\nThank you.", "timestamp_created": 1548603537, "timestamp_updated": 1548603537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.741830587387084961", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25643535": {"recommendationid": "25643535", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998218505", "num_games_owned": 435, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475029505}, "language": "english", "review": "Please note: The game does not work out of the box but the fix is simple. I have written a detailed guide on how to make the game work here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=768220278\n\nReview:\n\nThe game isn't as pretty as a game like GTA V, but remember this game came out on Xbox 360 in 2008. For the age, the graphics work well. If the graphics bother you, there are a plethora of mods available to up the graphics on various sites.\n\nAs with every GTA game, there is a lot of things to do in GTA IV. If you count for 100% completion, here's the breakdown:\n\n60%: the 90 story missions\n2%: assassinations\n2%: street races\n2%: Chop shop collections\n2%: Car thefts\n2%: Drug deliveries\n2.5%: Vigilante missions\n2.5%: Police Most Wanted hitman missions\n5%: Random Encounters\n5%: Activities\n5%: Special Activities\n5%: Competitions\n2.5%: Pigeon Hunter\n2.5%: Stunt Jumps\n(Source: [url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/933037-grand-theft-auto-iv/43592690]GameFaqs[/url])\n\nI played this on 360 when it came out and I averaged about 90 hours by taking my time with the main story. I'd estimate 20-40 hours of additional content remains not counting story missions depending on your skill and time invested.\n\nOverall, the game can be fun. The initial setup issues are what cause 99% of the negative reviews on Steam. Social Club also does not work as of September 2016 when I write this post, so just ignore the login prompt for it on launch. However this also means that the multiplayer aspect is sadly inaccessible. Rockstar made a post on their support forums saying they were looking into it on 6 Oct. 2015 (Source: [url=https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/200145226--Updated-5-18-16-Problems-logging-into-Social-Club-to-launch-GTAIV-for-PC]Rockstar Support[/url]) so it's likely that it will never be fixed as it currently looks.\n\nStill, if you never played the single-player, that's completely working. Several of the characters from GTAV are in GTAIV and further expands on their original context in the series here.\n\nIf you have any additional questions or concerns before buying the game that I have not answered here in my review, please leave a comment and I will append my review with the answer to your question.", "timestamp_created": 1474592183, "timestamp_updated": 1474608385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 128, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.827470362186431885", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34969523": {"recommendationid": "34969523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157265158", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 15191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547680421}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is pure nostalagia\nPros: very good graphics;\nstory;\ncars;\nbowling\netc.\n\nCons:\nGfWL", "timestamp_created": 1505474809, "timestamp_updated": 1507190046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698075294494628906", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42751347": {"recommendationid": "42751347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237058824", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549854789}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best Grand Theft Auto games ever, Very nice Driving mechanics, Fairly realistic ragdolls, Very nice gunfights, Awesome story! 10/10!", "timestamp_created": 1529100572, "timestamp_updated": 1543115591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.735839486122131348", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28242233": {"recommendationid": "28242233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116100475", "num_games_owned": 2081, "num_reviews": 244, "playtime_forever": 1615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482433666}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] I remember that time, when i was 14 and always wanted a XBOX 360 just to play the newest GTA Game.

Why am I writing this review? Because I nearly found myself dissuaded out of a perfectly good game by reviews that targeted easily bypassed issues.\n\nNow, I'd like to begin this by saying that no matter what platform you play it on, GTA IV is still a good game, and a fun entry to the GTA series. A lot of the other reviews for this game note that there's difficulty getting this game to work on PC, and, I won't lie, it's true; there are some hoops to jump through to get this game working. These reviews, however, vastly overstate the difficulty of playing this game, and as such, advise against it's purchase, but don't heed these reviews, the process of getting this game to work takes 10 minutes, 15 tops. Combined with the time it takes to download in the first place, this is totally negligible. \n\nDown to it: \nThere are two main barriers to pass before enjoying going bowling with your virtual cousin, Games for WIndows Live, and Social Club, both of which can be gotten around very easily. In the effort to not make this review a tutorial, I will simply say that there exist plenty of dedicated tutorials on the web, especially on support forums and the like.\n\nAt the end of the day, what you get is a great GTA game, with all of GTA's signature crazy storytelling. I've heard tell that there's a way to still access multiplayer too, and there are plenty of people who have done this.

If you move the mouse too slowly while aiming, like trying to accurately pop somebody's head but your crosshair is a couple millimeters away from that sweet shot, then the crosshair will not move at all, but instead wait for a faster mouse movement in order to move. I often find myself in situations where my crosshair is close, but not dead on, so I have to flick the crosshair away from my target and flick back onto him to take my shot.
