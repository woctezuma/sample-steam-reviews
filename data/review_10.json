Here you go:\n\nI remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.\n\nShooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.\n\nI wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008.  So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist. \n\nI am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots.

If you are someone who has never played counter-strike 1.6, I would have a tough time recommending this unless you want to check out where counter-strike got its roots from. There are some things in this game that are somewhat anti-competitive like crouch walking (some may call it silent-stepping, groundstrafing, g-stafing), quick-switching to reload faster, boosting people through roofs, the insane amount of wall bangs you can do. Some do raise the skill cap. Where this game shined for me was the modding community and the custom game modes. This is where kz started, where surfing started, where scoutzknivez started, bhopping was around before counter-strike but counter-strike had bhop communities as well. This is where weapon skins came from as modders would make custom models for weapons and custom player models. This and counter-strike: condition zero are the only counter-strike games to have a competitive knifing community because the knife mechanics were changed in other versions of counter-strike which made knifing non-competitive. You could get a headshot with a knife; how could you not like that! The graphics are definitely dated by today\u2019s standards and high fps with a high refresh rate monitor does not feel as smooth as in most modern fps games. Counter-strike has always been one of the best game series for the cost compared to what you get because of the communities and mods that sprung up around it. Counter-strike does not have a built-in matchmaking ladder like csgo. This is the game that really accelerated the esports industry. There has been so much esports history made in counter-strike. The reason why steam was created in the first place was to give people a more efficient way of updating their games and a way to implement a cheating protection know as Valve Anti-Cheat with counter-strike being the main focus. This game reminds you just how good you had it when you were a kid and not many games can rival the impact counter-strike has had on the esports and gaming industry.", "timestamp_created": 1511836435, "timestamp_updated": 1511930899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 71, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.837592184543609619", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15299184": {"recommendationid": "15299184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060064077", "num_games_owned": 709, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 49407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512842038}, "language": "english", "review": "Counter-Strike: Ok, after 9 years of unlimited fun with friends, I have finally quit counter strike.

It is, in my opinion, the best\n\ngame to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in.\n\nIt starts off with a team trying to kill another team. \n\nI started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun.\n\nThen I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course.\n\nWhen I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more.\n\nCS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically.\n\nOver the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness.\n\nIn conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel.

For many, days were spent in front of the computer screen, manipulating the WASD keys with left hand and whirling the mouse with the right one. People yell and frown, they cheer and jeer as they team up their cyber-persona and pit them against another team. It doesn\u2019t matter who won, who lost, who managed to kill to most of their opponents and who died the most, as everything will be scrambled up and reset when a new match begins. What is important is that, for those who are a part of the team, this computer game is their reality. These personas within the computer screen are their true identities. This is counter-strike. \n\nOriginally a modification (mod in short) made for Valve\u2019s critically acclaimed Half-Life, Counter-Strike has gained much prominence since its initial launch. It is one of the first and definitely one of the most critically acclaimed multi-player computer games of all times. It is also the game used for many professional electronic sports competitions, such as ESEA League. Of course, this does not put Counter-Strike as a \u201cprofessional only\u201d game, as it has been enjoyed by many since its launch.\n\nGetting started with Counter-strike is simple. You start off in one of the two teams: Counter-Terrorists or Terrorists. Before the round begins, you will have to purchase your own gun from the market, namely the famous AK47, M4A1, Desert Eagle, MP5, AWP and many more. Do not ask me why the counter-terrorists (namely the police) have to buy their own gun, and that they will have to go out with their lousy default colt pistols. Perhaps the government had some budget cuts and the SWATs have to buy their own guns. No one knows, but at least this will balance up the game. Also, you can equipment such as Highly-Explosive grenades, Flash-bangs (not recommend for beginners), smoke grenades, helmets and kevlars. You can also grab a defuse kit if you are playing on the side of the counter-terrorist, but normally we will steal that from dead teammates. Oh and you will be given a knife for free. Don\u2019t worry about it, as most likely you use it to run instead of anything else.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly straightforward as well. There are quite a few number of game mods. The most frequently played ones are the Bomb Defusal maps, such as the all-time famous de_dust, the Hostage Rescue maps such as cs_assault, the VIP Escorting maps and the Kill Them All maps, such as the custom fy_iceworld and awp_map. Like all multi-player First Person Shooters, you will need good coordination and communication with your teammates if you want to win. Don\u2019t worry about it though, because if you are new, just stick around and listen to what others have got to say. Just remember, you are not John Rambo, you only have 100 HP, and a stray bullet from a sniper rifle (AWP) will deal more damage than that.\n\nAs time press on, the mechanism of Counter-Strike became outdate. Of course, the legacy of Counter-Strike continues through its successors such as Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike Online (Asia only) and, the newest of all, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

Play this game, then play a modern FPS multiplayer game, and you will see that this game was the innovator. A deliverer of fine quick reflex shooting and an unlimited skill learning curve. A provider of that instant gratification kill which was solely based on skill. There are no perks, levels, experience points to give you the edge. You are either the best of the match, or you aren't. You cant become \"level 100\" by just playing 15 hours a day like most modern day multiplayer shooters. When you die, you have to wait. This is the punishment. You wait, and watch, and learn your enemies tactics, and choice of weapons. You learn who's the best, so that you can save that extra flash bang just for that sucker. This punishment is gives tremendous value to the kill. When the other player is dead, hes gone. He's crying, lighting up a cigarette, going to the bathroom, watching how badass you are, or all of the above. He was eliminated, gone, for 10 minutes. The team tactics are a whole other story. If a team is being plastered by another team with more skilled players, it can make a comeback with team tactics. Team tactics are essential to the success of an average team. Also the level of modifications that this game offers cannot be overlooked. Every weapon has its own characteristics, and your fighting style must adapt to the weapon you have chosen. Yes this is also true with modern shooters, but CS emphasized this more. There are no cheap weapons, no grenade launchers or rocket launchers.

Do i need to say more?\n\nMods on this game are amazing too. There is a mod where you can catch pokemon, level them up, train them and use their skills. Call of Duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self, Warcraft mods, zombie mods, basebuilder and so on...\n\nThere is even a map for the jailbreak gamemode that has driveable snowmobiles. \n\n1337/10\n\nLeet crew 5 lyf\n\nKicks csgo's ass by a mile.
