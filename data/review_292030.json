A game that is 'on rails' is something akin to Tomb Raider (2013) or Life is Strange; they're games that place heavy emphasis on the story, using pre-set movements and animations to create a flowing, cinematic experience. \n\nConversly there are also 'free' games - games such as Skyrim, where the emphasis is on the players actions - you're the main character of this world, you get to explore it.\n\nFew games can mix the cinematic feeling of an 'on rails' game and the freedom of a 'free' game, yet The Witcher III does so perfectly. I both feel completely in control of my actions, and yet I am also watching a cinematic experience. \n\nI'm going to try and break down the three elements I believe are the strongest in The Witcher III:\n\nStory, Locations and Music.\n\nStory:\n\nThe story of The Witcher III, is, at its core, very simple - you are a witcher. You kill monsters, and you're trying to find a girl. But a story is more than the summary, it's the people in it, and trust me, the characters feel like people. Triss, Yennefer, Ciri, Geralt, Dandelion, they all feel like perfectly fleshed out characters. At times they feel like actors performing as themselves, because they truly feel so real, there's almost a disconnect - they're so realistically human yet simply side characters to a game, it's incredible. Each feels like they could be the main character of their own.\n\nLocations:\n\nThe locales of The Witcher III are heavily inspired by slavic reality, Novigrad is simply Novogorod, and it's truly beautiful - the diversity of war torn Temeria, the Tuscan-inspired splendour of Toussaint, the bustling merchant city of Novigrad, the scandavian-irish-scottish influenced Ard Skelig all tell their own story through their aesthetics, people, dialects, and questlines. Every area feels like this is the 'main' area with its own culture - truly making you feel like you're just another person in this huge world, and it creates such a large and beautiful space to understand.\n\nMusic:\n\nMusic is the best, isn't it? Game scores can be inspiring, egging us onwards and calming us afterwards. Witcher III does music is beautiful, so perfectly - 'You're Immortal', 'Fields of Ard Skelig' and 'The Slopes Of The Blessure' will never leave my music playlists. The musical influences - polish folk songs for Temeria / Redania, italian and french music for Toussaint and celtic influences in Ard Skelig help create this diverse world before you that perfectly sets the scene. Marcin Przyby\u0142owicz and Mikolai Stroinski both deserve just as much praise as the art directors.\n\nI know this review hasn't touched gameplay much, because ultimately, The Witcher III's core focus isn't sword play, it's a story being told in front of you, but unlike, say, Skyrim, you can actually influence this spectacular world you have been presented.\n\nCDProjekt Red have re-defined what a game could be, for me. Sure, if you value skill and core gameplay more than the games story and environments, Witcher III mightn't be for you. But for those seeking a storyline and environments to inspire them, characters to grip them, and ultimately one of the best swan songs in gaming, hell, media history, then please, do yourself a favour and pick up The Witcher III.\n\n10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1550012726, "timestamp_updated": 1550012726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549022853374481201", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49251097": {"recommendationid": "49251097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074224555", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3456, "last_played": 1551656205}, "language": "english", "review": "Witcher 3 > Skyrim\n\nFinal Statement 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1551209000, "timestamp_updated": 1551209000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49321038": {"recommendationid": "49321038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092296799", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6264, "last_played": 1551630605}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremly good game!\n\n+Amazing story\n+Good combat\n+Great side-quest\n+Awesome DLC\n+Very good music\n\n-Geralt can't take a 2cm fall\n\nPut 130+ hours in this game the last 2 weeks.\n\nWORTH A BUY!", "timestamp_created": 1551553433, "timestamp_updated": 1551553433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576271176338195801", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48849661": {"recommendationid": "48849661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326631772", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550373309}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is perfect", "timestamp_created": 1549641417, "timestamp_updated": 1549641417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48819043": {"recommendationid": "48819043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210008456", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549881538}, "language": "english", "review": "WORTH TO BUY !!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1549533631, "timestamp_updated": 1549533631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543859660625457764", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48823970": {"recommendationid": "48823970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065335603", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1468, "last_played": 1551468860}, "language": "english", "review": "watching Youtube videos doesnt do this game justice, i eventually caved because it was on sale and got the GOTY edition and my god WHAT A PRETAAY GAME!.

So Ive listed them in order below the line below:\n\nMy only faults are:\n1: Just to play for 60 minutes, takes an whole hour! @$%*?! ( I have screenshots to prove this (sorry only in English)\n2: If you exit the game you can no longer play it, until you load again.\n3: If you press pause the game freezes.  (quick fix! if you press pause again it starts playing) I know right!\n4: If you play the game again after finishing, you start to see the same things (this happened on numerous occasions, also I have photographic proof of this. Almost becomes unplayable after the 4th time round)\n5: Page 6 of the manual is on page 2 (It used to be 2 pages after the last page (i have tried to recreate this to take photographic proof, but sadly to no avail)\n6: It doesn't have micro transations\n7: Unless you know Polish you will find it very hard to understand the Polish audio setting (TIP: Play on English vocals, works for me, and im British ?)\nAnd last quick tip: If you dont have a keyboard and mouse, you can use a controller!\n\nBut seriously it is one of the best games i have ever played, a true must have title from a company you can really trust CD Projekt Red. Just look at the review graph \"Overwhelming\" by us for us rating cant lie..

Plus the combinations of making potions and armors/swords makes this a solid combat system with variety. What really got me about this game is the choices you have to make. All the choices in this game are morally grey, just like real life.  The soundtrack is excellent and really gets you involved in the game.

Sometimes the enemy changes it up a little, like they'll fly, teleport, or dig underground, but that's more just delaying the fight as opposed to bringing in a challenge.\nThe whole game's mechanics are wonky when they're not being simple, and there are too many examples of this; using a certain magic skill will sometimes waste stamina without the animation at least trying to play out as intended, you don't always go through the reload animations after using a crossbow, hitboxes are confusing for both the enemy and Geralt, environmental physics can interrupt gameplay on a constant basis, and so on.\nIn addition to the broken gameplay, there are just poor design choices overall, like a lack of organization within almost the entirety of the inventory menus, disabling the jump feature when in combat, extremely high level quests being right next to extremely low level ones, being only able to track one quest at a time, etcetera etcetera. \nAll of that and there are also loads of bugs in this game that haven't been addressed.\n\nThe gameplay of these games were never really the focus, which is probably why they're often poorly executed. Being originally based on a series of books by the same name, the story focus is strong.\nThere are massive amounts of quests in this game ranging from simple treasure hunts to witcher contracts that just need you to kill a monster to stories that may get a big-named character killed. They're all interesting in their own way and are what will take up most of your time. Even the treasure hunts can get interesting since they all start with messages that show a little backstory as to why the treasure is there to begin with; you even get to see a little summary in the quest log for these along with every quest you complete written by Geralt's old bard friend.\nThere are various ways to do many of the quests in this game, whether they depend on the dialogue options you choose when speaking to characters or just how you approach them altogether. Some quests can even start in very different locations; for example, you can start a kill-a-monster quest by coming across the monster itself accidentally as opposed to finding the noticeboard where you're intended to start it, in a way being able to complete the quest before it even actually begins.\nThe writing in this game is very well done. There's a lot of it and is well-structured. However, it's so massive, that it can feel like an info-dump at times.\nThere are loads of times when you get dialogue options, but it can be very hard to tell when they actually affect the current story.\nWhen faced with moral decisions, the writing does seem to be heavily biased towards playing hero as the rewards are often much higher and the stories in question go on longer. You don't even get a few EXP for being a true neutral witcher and saying \"I'm staying out of it\" as the quest just fails or becomes no longer available right then & there.\n\nExploring is almost half the game. It's incredibly atmospheric and the maps are extremely massive, and it's a more gorgeous sight with the graphics turned up all the way to max.\n\nThe game's a huge entry in the Witcher series. If you still have a Witcher 2 save file in your hard drive, you can import it onto here and some of the choices you made there will affect some parts of this game.\nYou get a whole lot for the base price.

The major difference between this game and its Witcher predecessors is the introduction of a colossal open world with such stunning attention to detail. \n\nThe world in which the story takes place has a thematic approach to the extraordinary amounts of turbulence, starting with the excellent character development, excellent lore base story, an excellent fluid combat system, and fascinating exploration style. This turbulence draws players into an immersive experience based upon conflict and choices. \n\nThe Witcher 3 is brilliantly designed to strike a balance between complicated struggles and problems that allows a good amount of breathing room to engage in crafting, exploring and side-quests.\n\nThe women of Witcher 3 play a vital and familiar role in this story. We remember many of them from past chronicles, the most powerful of them are former members of the Lodge of Sorceresses. In addition to these barely likable characters' is the stories' main plot female, Ciri, who has been missing for a long time and is now in peril from an otherworldly faction. The game takes the role-playing experience with Ciri to another level as it periodically lets you take control of her and engage in combat using a slim but powerful combat style. \n\nKIlling, problem-solving, exploring and treasure hunting round out the experience as you progress through a choices-matter story. It is so detailed that entire chunks of content could be skipped unintentionally if you make a wrong decision, barring you from succeeding quests further along in the chain. Geralt himself sometimes feels akin to some monsters that display qualities of reasoning, intelligence, emotions and a desire to be part of the human-dominated world they live in.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who can stomach a fair amount of blood and gore, is not offended by brief female chest nudity and a rather large commitment of time to unravel the story. In addition to a compelling rich, choices-matter story is the massive scope of main and side quests that are available. The world is environmentally and atmospherically stunning. The game is performance friendly to most PC's that have been manufactured with within the last five years. The developers made a jewel of a role-playing game that should provide at least 200 hours of spent solving the main story.

It is without a doubt the best RPG I have ever played. \n\nOne of the best bits of the game is it\u2019s story. It has one thing that I find many RPGs to be lacking, and that is a compelling, and most importantly emotionally investing story. You feel the impact of every decision, and you regret the outcomes of your mistakes. The side quest are where this philosophy really comes out, with not a single quest that doesn\u2019t have some unexpected outcome, or emotionally investing decision to make. \n\nThe game is also still tremendously nice to look at, even now in 2019. While the water effects and animations are starting to show their age, the textures are still at a higher resolution and look then games that came out even this year. Not to mention the fact that this game has a whole host of mods to improve its visual capabilities.\n\nThe final thing to consider with this game is the amount of gameplay this game has available. It has interesting combat, and even a separate game within the game. This game is an easy 100-200 hour experience, and the price doesn\u2019t do it justice.

There is a fair bit to tinker with from upgrades to potions, skills, bombs, items, gwent cards and much more. Most things are easy to access in game and or in menus. Plenty of guides and in game instruction to point you in the right direction. Some quests can be a bit buggy but if you continue to play the game out you should be ok in my experience\n\nCombat: Very simplistic and effective combat. it does however get very dry very quick if your into more complex or fighting style based games. \n\nGraphics: Top of the line graphics for its year and system requirements\n\nStory: About as good as any game I have played. Very in-depth and lots of time/effort to make  it and keep it interesting. Both in game and out side of game lore is nicely done and makes sense.\n\nMonsters/Characters/NPC's: Excellent. I did honestly feel more cycling and different monsters \n                                             could be added instead of re-using the same ones in different \n                                             regions but that is being picky.\n\nExtras/Addons/Expansions: Blood and Wine is a very nice expansion. Lots of great content. Hearts of Stone is not as big as Blood and Wine. some nice quests and a whole new element to items and upgrades. Gwent in its own right is a fantastic well balanced game let alone fun additional element to a much bigger game.  I was very addicted to gwent when I finally started playing.\n\nMusic/Sound: The music is pretty good and the sound is usually relevent to whats happening in the game.\n\nOverall: There are still so many aannoying bugs that make me want to throw my computer through a window and with overly simplistic combat style that gets dry quick the game is not going to be for everyone. In my opinion there is still enough there to make the game one of the best games of its genre and time ever made. 9/10 for me", "timestamp_created": 1550853722, "timestamp_updated": 1550882113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507042229175567627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49022368": {"recommendationid": "49022368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013961478", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 1454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 874, "last_played": 1551729291}, "language": "english", "review": "Damn you're ugly", "timestamp_created": 1550294362, "timestamp_updated": 1550294362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49139326": {"recommendationid": "49139326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088269191", "num_games_owned": 375, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1213, "last_played": 1551799584}, "language": "english", "review": "Fuckin' yes mate.

Where to even begin...\n\nI don't even write reviews!!! That's a start. But this game...this game needs - nay - deserves one! \n\nThis game can be summed up with the following: This is the greatest game I have ever played. Period. \n\nThe above sentence previously applied to The Last of Us by Naughty Dog, and I didn't think that I would feel that about another game any time soon. Then came the Witcher 3. But wait - plot twist - I didn't like the game the first time I played it! Thought it was average, drawn out, and nothing special.\n\nI first bought the game for PS4 right after release in 2015, without any prior knowledge about the Witcher series. I just knew the game had a lot of hype, so I thought I'd try it out. Bad idea. Going into this masterpiece with a casual mindset was the wrong thing to do. So what happened? Was this love at first glance? No. I played for a few hours; thought to myself: \"meh\" and didn't play it again.\n\nEnter 2017, the year I built my first custom PC. For some reason I had decided to enter the PC master race (must have been due to binge watching all those desk setup videos on YouTube). Anyways, I built my PC, bought all the bells and whistles and finally had a shiny new GTX 1070 to push majority of games to that crisp 1440p on my ultrawide monitor. \n\nAs I began to peruse steam, The Witcher 3 showed up again in my queue. After seeing the 'Overwhelmingly Positive' rating I decided to actually read the reviews a little and was just blown away by the love that this game had been receiving, even well after launch. \n\nSo I ponied up and dropped a measly $40 (feel like I robbed CD Projekt Red) or so on the GOTY edition and decided this time would be different. This time, I was going to try to absorb myself in the lore, soak in everything as much as possible and truly give it another shot.\n\n193 hours later (at the time of this review) the rest is history. \n\nI have now finished all the main and side quests in the main game, as well as all things in the two 'expansion' packs (don't even get me started on these fake DLCs - they're AAA titles themselves - but that's for another time).\n\nI've still got a few undiscovered locations in the game world to explore, but once that's done I'll have finished my path in the game. \n\nBut am I truly finished? Does one ever truly finish admiring masterpieces like The Dark Knight? Or reading Harry Potter? or watching The Lord or The Rings or Star Wars?\n\nShort answer - No. You simply don't. Even as I write this, I'm listening to the phenomenal sound track in the background.\n\nThis game, like any other, is not perfect. But it is damn close. \n\nTL;DR - Buy this game, and then maybe, just maybe, you will have lived a full life.", "timestamp_created": 1551279223, "timestamp_updated": 1551279223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49267308": {"recommendationid": "49267308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070269925", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 763, "last_played": 1551394440}, "language": "english", "review": "CD Projekt Red is a wonderful developer who cares about their consumers.", "timestamp_created": 1551294867, "timestamp_updated": 1551294867, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49268830": {"recommendationid": "49268830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105803539", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 825, "last_played": 1551640050}, "language": "english", "review": "Cant say much, Just one and only gaming masterpiece !", "timestamp_created": 1551302475, "timestamp_updated": 1551302475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49319982": {"recommendationid": "49319982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199538455", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517432377}, "language": "english", "review": "Rare Game i would say.

The biggest plus for me though, is its consistency with its creature mechanics. I was bamboozled twice by wraiths in this game and in Witcher 2, because I didn't read what wraiths were known to do. The infuriating outcomes from my choices made sense, and is why I really enjoyed the series.\n\nThere are janky swimming mechanics though, and Roche is a bloody hassle to control.

I had previously played witcher 1 and 2 on my console and they were okay at best (6.5 for the first one because of somewhat of a unusual combat and a solid 7 for the 2nd one , liked the story but didnt quite like the linearity of the game ) and i absolutely had zero idea what i was going into since it was going to be the first open world RPG developed by CD project RED . I saw many reviews about the game and they all praised it and held it in high regard . unfortunately my pc was garbage at that time when this game came out so i completely let this game slip under my radar. when i actually started playing the game i was seriously shocked (in a good way) and dumbfounded that how can a game have so much content and that too good content. \n\nAll the side missions are excellent and kinda necessary as there will be an epic fight during the final act of the game where you can ask all these characters to join you in the fight. the story is excellent . the soundtrack is excellent. There are absolutely no bugs (none that i have encountered) .the mission design is excellent. Nothing feels out of place here . plus there are 2 outstanding DLC s which open up 2 completely new locations with different enemies and different quests . you can invest 100 hours into this game easily and still you wont be bored and still there will be something in the game for you to do. \n\nTL;DR overall i really dont think a rating out of 10 will do justice to this masterpiece but if it has to be a rating system i would give it 10/10 . it is really a must have.\n\nOverall The Witcher 3 is an example that development studios exist who dont chase after the green bill and actually love making games for us the gaming community and publishers who dont force developers to rush out a half baked cake (Im looking at you EA)", "timestamp_created": 1551838972, "timestamp_updated": 1551838972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49388459": {"recommendationid": "49388459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198803089380", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 102, "last_played": 1551741409}, "language": "english", "review": "So I played the hell out of this on the Xbox One when it came out (did not have a PC with the graphics card to run it for the PC at the time) and loved it.

They all bore me before I hardly even begin.  If I manage to stick it out it is usually because I just skip through all the story and just hack stuff to death in a grind to play what usually just becomes an inventory management game then or whatever.\n\nThat certainly isn't the case thus far with The Witcher.  It seems to be so well put together not just from the story perspective but also in the way that the world feels so open and sandbox like, yet still doesn't leave me clueless as to what I'm suppose to do next or where I might want to head.  It is and isn't leading you, it's such a tough thing to balance right but I enjoy it like no other.\n\nCombat is interesting with quite a bit of focus on defensive moves.  The spells thus far are pretty neat as well. The overall \"Witcher effect\" I've seen before in other games, or at least something similar, but it really shines here in the way the story seems to embrace it in varying ways.  Haven't done much yet with the crafting but it looks to be as well put together as the rest.\n\nI'm enjoying the game enough that I'm even listening to any obvious side story tales.  The voice acting is just as good as the writing on these.  If any are cliche you'd hardly notice.\n\nThe graphics are absolutely stunning turned all the way up and the overall user interface might just be perfection for an RPG.\n\nYes I'm really enjoying The Witcher, and glad I've already picked up the DLC's.

It has been quite a ride. Bought it since I needed a new game to play and it was on sale. And honestly I wasn't that hyped to play it. I didn't see it as a very interesting game.\n\nLong story short, my first impression of the game was like this - huh cool; mehhhh; not bad; mehhhh. Why is that you might ask? Hear me out.\n\nWell to give more context, I bought Witcher 3 after I completed Dark Souls 3 and by completed I mean getting every single achievement. So I do have some experience in playing hard games and bla bla bla, but the thing about Witcher 3 was that is was like ultra hard af. Monsters literally one/two shot you and your shield ability also absorbs only one hit. At the beginning I found that extremely frustrating. I was literally thinking \"this game is freaking 5 time harder than Dark Souls wtf\". Now still to this very moment I don't know if that was because I chose hard diff or is it similiar to other diff as well. I mean to be fair there was even harder diff than \"hard\", so I am lost for words. \n\nI also really felt uncomfortable with the controls/mechanics, they felt really... I can't even put it to words, but the way I played in Dark Souls 3 it felt really balanced and comfortable, as where in Witcher 3 it was just unpleasant, but hey I think that's just me!\n\nMoving on, to the good stuff - Story is beautiful, the world itself is huge and pretty, all the quests have some sort of side story which you don't see in other games. DLC's are very rewarding: giving extra \"powering up\" potential with new upgrades and etc. but most importantly - MORE GREAT STORY. \n\nBesides all the good stuff, I want to point out some things after fully finishing the game. Bad ones to be specific.\n\nHorses...... My holy mother of jesus. I have never seen such chaotic and MOST annoying horse riding mechanics in my life. Like seriously. And the thing is with a world this size, you use your horse like 80% of the time. I would want to brag about horse mechanics for an hour to someone and have them comfort me later. \n\nTo put it simply, your horse is like the biggest pu**y ever. You try to make a simple turn, you have plenty of space, but your horse just stops in the middle of the turn, you sprint in a straight line, somehow it gets disturbed by fence which is like half a meter away. The delay between jump is like solid 1.5sec like wtf. Also it doesn't even jump sometimes at all. And the list goes on... \n\nSO GLAD I don't have to mess with him anymore. Oh and btw, summoning of the horse is also stupid. For a person like me who is \"Call, Jump on, Sprint\" type, basically I don't want to spend 10 seconds every single time just to get on him, 'cause the way it is now is - Call him, he spawn always behind you, which means the opposite direction you want to go + spawns about 15~ meters away + moves like the slowest ass in the world. That's just frustrating.\n\nJust like the horse, swimming mechanics were also terrible, but I mainly felt it just as very irresponsible, they worked something like this - You press one button, it activates a certain animation.  So in a long run its not terrible, but when you have to maneuvere in small areas it was a pain in the ass.\n\nWelp, I think I got most of what I wanted to say about this game.\n\nJust as a note, so glad I got Blood and Wine DLC, just because I could see [spoiler]Ciri[/spoiler] again. \n\nTo sum up, this game definitely has a lot in store so definitely give it a shot, but be aware of some REALLY annoying mech's 'cause believe me, they will haunt you forever.", "timestamp_created": 1551655888, "timestamp_updated": 1551655888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496240615844726563", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49356705": {"recommendationid": "49356705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103584563", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 34054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 135, "last_played": 1551876564}, "language": "english", "review": "you know why this game is 10/10?\n\nGeralt.", "timestamp_created": 1551714201, "timestamp_updated": 1551714201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48794454": {"recommendationid": "48794454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103874171", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549446081}, "language": "english", "review": "Very Good.", "timestamp_created": 1549444422, "timestamp_updated": 1549444422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478275299072265625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48857449": {"recommendationid": "48857449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039699953", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549903120}, "language": "english", "review": "I so rarely write reviews, but 150 hours later and I figured this game deserved the highest praise I could give it.

As for the exploration, yes it is a huge world, but it's extremely boring and everywhere I go seems to have nothing that interests me besides maybe a small quest here and there or a board with more quests which are all pretty boring. Gameplay wise, the combat seemed fun, but I never understood the systems and never really wanted to or had the motivation to do so, It seemed overly complicated when using the small spells, dodging, and normal attacks worked just fine and felt pretty good. Although overall, my biggest complaint has to be how boring the main character is, Geralt, he has no personality besides being a badass that kills monsters. I couldn't care less about his character and therefore don't care about anything he has to do. When I had more fun playing as Ciri for about 15 minutes It hit me how boring and just not captivating the entire world and characters are. Overall, I don't recommend this game, instead, go play Breath of the Wild, I don't want to seem like a Nintendo fanboy who doesn't give any other games a chance, but I believe i've given this one a fair chance, and it didn't grab me anything like Breath of the Wild did, go play that game right now instead of this one.", "timestamp_created": 1549842154, "timestamp_updated": 1549842154, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.384909868240356445", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48884594": {"recommendationid": "48884594", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996740894", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550378711}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game years ago, played maybe 4 hours, and couldn't get into it. Requested a refund, steam denied it, and it sat in my library. I don't often play games anymore, but I noticed it last week sitting in my library and thought \"hey, I paid full price for this, it's critically acclaimed, and I never put any time into it.\" So I gave it a second chance. I still don't like it, and here's why. For every good thing about this game, there is a massive annoyance that comes with it. And here they are.\n\nThe world is beautiful, just looking at the art of this game I would give it a 9/10. Then you try to walk through it and get hung up and clipped by every twig sticking out of the ground. Riding your hydrophobic horse off-road? Prepare for constant clipping issues. As you explore the world, you'll also notice that basically every village and town is indistinguishable from the last. The major cities and major zones have their own looks, but the villages do not. Moreover, they all feel somehow empty to me. Worse, once you explore those cities and villages, you'll notice that, astoundingly, the developers reused character models for multiple characters--including major ones. Ciri makes an appearance in the beginning of the game as a child. Ciri's model as a child is recycled with a different hairstyle multiple times. A Nilfgaardian captain early on is part of the main quest line and cannot avoid being seen, yet the developers reused his exact model for multiple other random characters like a blacksmith you may meet in another city. This is baffling to me that a AAA game developer couldn't bother making unique models for their characters, not even those who appear briefly in the main questline.\n\nThe sound is excellent and crisp. The dialogue and performances by the voice actors is nothing short of fantastic... EXCEPT the lead character, Geralt! The peasants all have a brilliant gruff rural English accents that sound medieval and crude, the Nilfgaardians sound delightfully foreign and slightly snobbish, all of the leads have voices perfectly matching their character (all are British or non-native English speaking Euro-accents). Then Geralt is an American who sounds like Viggo Mortensen doing a bad Clint Eastwood impersonation. It gets worse... Geralt drops the subject from almost every sentence he speaks, and it sounds ridiculous. A normal person might say \"I spoke to him, and he told me he wouldn't help. I can't say I blame him, so I continued anyway.\" Geralt says \"spoke to him.... told me he wouldn't help... can't say I blame him... continued anyway....\" and it just sounds like amazingly bad writing, really unnatural and affected like someone trying to sound like a badass doing... well, a bad Clint Eastwood impersonation.\n\nThe characters are really interesting, but the development of your character, Geralt, is a snooze-fest. At no point in this game did I ever care about leveling up. No items are interesting, all of the skills you gain are grindy +1% to so and so, and the casting system is the single most lackluster casting system in any game I've ever played. I don't know why it's even included.\n\nInteresting monsters and bestiary, but trash combat system for fighting them. Every fight you will ever encounter in this game is either A) dramatically under your level so that you just click repeatedly, or B) equal or above your level which results in strike-strike-roll, strike-strike-roll, strike-strike roll, repeat until enemy is dead. EVERY fight. They tried to make Geralt a sort of specialist monster hunter who gathers information then customizes his fights to focus on the weakness of the adversary, but in practice this has minimal impact and is in the periphery of combat. Strike-strike-roll, strike-strike-roll! Every. Fight. You've got 3rd person combat like Skyrim which is dirt simple and goes more for casual fun than detailed system, then you've got For Honor 3rd person combat which is exceedingly complex and unique. The Witcher 3 feels like it wants to have a complex system that the player really needs to dig into, but it ended up just a clunky burden rather that you instead struggle to get around whenever possible.\n\nRidiculous alchemy system. It's basically like an MMO, you just pick certain leaves or monster body parts and combine it based on a generic pre-made formula that you've found... AND once you make the potion once, it automatically regenerates itself any time you rest, er, I mean \"meditate\", by using up one alcoholic beverage from your inventory. So you really only need to loot that mushroom and monster tooth once in the game. After that, it's just pointless orange glow and \"press e to loot\" signs popping up when you don't ever need to gather any ingredients in this game.\n\nLastly, the choices that define Geralt's personality in this game are very often made for you. Now, you might say \"not every game has to be Fable!\" Well, yes and no. This is a triple A open world RPG released in 2015. After all the Fable games, all the Elder Scrolls games, etc etc, it's sort of become industry standard that you get a say in defining who your character is. A modern open world that doesn't let you steer your character's personality in any significant way is missing something in my opinion. And to be clear, there is choice in this game, some of it relevant. But dialogue options that would define your character and should affect relationships are usually designed in such a way that you MUST choose one side. Faction war? Your side is chosen for you. Domestic dispute? Your side is chosen for you. Questionable actions from an occupying captain? Game dictates that you will respond with sarcasm and distrust and side with the peasants. This happens over and over, for the most part the game will tell YOU what your character does and feels. The only choice you get to make is how long you put up with strike-strike-roll and grinding to get that extra +1% to your quick attacks before getting bored and playing something more exciting, like, I don't know, Tetris or maybe checkers.", "timestamp_created": 1549749799, "timestamp_updated": 1549750412, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.395842641592025757", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48905758": {"recommendationid": "48905758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066891621", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549854827}, "language": "english", "review": "After taking a few hours to look into everything and apply any needed bug fixes, etc. The game still randomly crashes and steam refuses to refund because it locked my computer up for almost 3 hours until i decided to just unplug it from the frickin wall.

These factors are very important for a quality RPG and The Witcher 3 definitely stands out compared to the shallowness of many recent titles in that genre.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many (maybe minor) issues, especially regarding gameplay, adding up so much it didn't make me enjoy the game as much as I should:\n\n- Combat is pretty dull - basically dodge, spank and keep Quen up - and isn't helped by the fact that Gerald moves more like a ballerina rather than an actual fighter. Also, while in combat, he cannot jump at all, meaning that even the tiniest of walls becomes an insurmountable barrier, severly restricting combat movement.\n\n- Graphics are very good indeed for a 2015 game, though not mind-blowing as many people say. Unfortunately, I seldomly get a possibility to enjoy these graphics. Why? Because it's basically night all day long and you can't see shit 50m in the distance. Why is that you might ask? Because there's almost always a storm or somesuch raging, totally obscuring everything and making it impossible to tell night from day. Until you check the clock and realize it's not 3am as you thought, but 1pm.\n\n- I like loot. A lot. And there's tons of it in this game. But picking it up is an incredible pain in the ass in this game. It's simply absurd that you need just 1min to take out the enemies in a bandit camp, but you'll sometimes need 5+mins to gather all the loot. That's because you need to stand in some specific angle before an object in order to loot it, resulting in some more ballerina lessons before being able to pick it up.\n\n-Other issue regarding loot: Literally everyone you meet tells you how hard life is, how their houses got robbed, that their wives got raped and their lifelihood taken away. They seem to be so accustomed to it that, despite all their never-ending complaints, you can simply walk into their house, say hi, steal everything right under their nose and walk back out. Noone cares. It would be an understatement to say that this is an immersion breaker.\n\nAnyway, there's a lot more such examples I could give. But you got the idea and I absolutely don't wanna make it seem like I hate this game. As I said, story and setting wise, it's really up there. The devs definitely put a lot of effort and soul into this, and it shows. But I cannot deny the fact that there were many issues that bothered me, to an extent that they outshone the many positives.", "timestamp_created": 1550859343, "timestamp_updated": 1550859404, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.392777293920516968", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49287129": {"recommendationid": "49287129", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993495669", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4629, "last_played": 1551852771}, "language": "english", "review": "1. Wait for enemy to swing\n2. Dodge\n3. Attack\n\nCongratulations, you\u2019ve just beaten the Witcher 3. \n\nI bought this game thinking it was an obvious winner, while I have great respect for CDPR for their ethics as developers, not so much for the actual game design philosophy. \n\nThere are great efforts to distinguish types of monsters via storytelling and gameplay, you can do research which will elucidate monster weaknesses before you fight them. Which is fun until you realize everything in the game has the same attack pattern (Yes, every. Single. thing.).  Humanoids are even more of a joke, as they can be one-shot-executed or you can spam weak attacks until their guard breaks as most cannot counter. In the case that they can, see my intro.\n \nI\u2019m sure the story is captivating but it\u2019s hard to push through the terrible combat, even if it is your cup of tea you might give up after the constant bugs disable your ability to dodge at key moments or your horse\u2019s ability to dash, or the fact your swings have an rng element and you get killed because Geralt decided to take 5 seconds longer on that particular swing- It feels less like playing a game and I\u2019m shouting commands at a big idiot because the response to inputs make no sense. Oh yeah, the lock-on targeting system doesn\u2019t actually work, that\u2019s fun too. There\u2019s also oils which add to the combat, but I could spend pages on this, so I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s bad as well.\n\nAs for the world, there are insane amounts of points of interest for exploring, which would be great if the combat was functional. Also, seeing as there is still no economical method of generating thousands of unique enemies and npcs, this adds up to lots of recycled content that don\u2019t do their job of making the world feel full.\n\nSoundtrack is fantastic, best thing about the game. Graphics are nice and the voice acting is also good, the world looks drab at times however.\n\nI can\u2019t even imagine what the developers were thinking with this one, maybe cut out some of the eight million pointless filler points on the map and instead spend that time on coding decent combat and more than one enemy type. Maybe go for two, that\u2019s twice as many. \n\nI earnestly hope their next title does better, because their aesthetics are fantastic, I\u2019d love to have good gameplay go along with it as well.\n", "timestamp_created": 1551400644, "timestamp_updated": 1551400644, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.404313057661056519", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49187246": {"recommendationid": "49187246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032210632", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 281, "last_played": 1550929302}, "language": "english", "review": "Over the years, I've tried 3 times to get into this game and enjoy it, but I simply cannot.

I can't seem to find any fix for this online just people complaining about all kinds of glitches related and unrelated to this.

Overrated beyond all other games I've seen being hyped for, never jumped on it myself. \n\nWitcher 3 has scenic views, good audio, fine texture quality, at the suffering of quite redundant gimmicks that are used once, as if they were used just to show off what they can develop. Xenovox, a walkie talkie like item, labeled quest item, which seem quite useful, even for the future, is completely useless after the quest for it is done, alongside it is the Magic Lamp, showing conversations of ghosts, being used twice. Redundancy further arrives when you can deny payment, and show that Witchers can have emotions, wether it's heroism, honour, or humility. This is then dropped when moved to Velen/Novigrad, and isn't really highlighted out again, except for some vague \"do it for coin\".\n\nGameplay's quite predictable, even similar to a blend of Skyrim and Dark Souls, being fluid, yet stupid. The way attacks are made by Geralt, is dancing with his swords, delaying the intentional attacks by roughly 40%, as if it were input lag. And is actually quite frustrating, but can get used to, though it dulls your skill. Gameplay variety is low, as it focuses on sword combat, signs can be used, but feels gimmicky due to  how low their intensity is from level 1 to ~25, and the crossbow is useless throughout the game, and is a glorified mini-harpoon for underwater \"combat\", one-shotting your enemies underwater.\n\nStory is quite, frankly, shit paced, especially if you're doing side quests, contracts, etc. You're looking for your daughter, and there you are, exploring everything else, doing small duties, whilst Cirilla is being hunted by the Wild Hunt. Ala Fallout 4 which I find disgusting. The only griping story I found was with Bloody Baron about a certain baby. Neither the side quests aren't really  interesting as most of them require you to use Witcher Sense for most, if not all side quests, as if it were a fetch quest turned into kill quest with mediocre combat gameplay loop.\n\nSkill system is minimal, leaving specific builds at most, leaving you with what others will most likely play. Healing system is especially bad during the beginning, foods healing 50 health per second for 5 seconds, while you start out with 3500 health, and it's quite easy to die early on. To counter this you can get \"Gourmet\", taking a whole skill slot, and you have 12 in total, and the perk itself makes food useful, but too useful, making them from 5 seconds to 20 minutes. Most skills are minimalistic, too, as if they were not supposed to make the game feel unbalanced, but gets quite to be a chore.\n\nThe enviroment is honestly just boring, Velen is just a swamp land, with a fitting meme which is Shrek, and I do not meme reviews. This alongside Novigrad is where you will spend most of the time, where Novigrad mostly consist of the city and farmlands, both lands take place in one map. The next map that takes place is Skellige, multiple isles, which in itself beautiful, but annoying with how hilly they are, and how spread they are. With these isles spread throughout, there's more water, and undiscovered locations in the ocean, where most of them are underwater, and aforementioned underwater combat is just a tank vs paper planes in short.\n\nTo conclude it... I really have to say that Witcher 3 sets no new standards, it's done the same work as other similar open world RPGs, and most decisions are meaningless, apart from the main quest decisions, making the game mostly a grey choices or just straighout pointless. \n\nAt best, I see Witcher 3 having a score of 7 and least at 5, as I see no point of doing the same combat throughout roughly 90 hours of the game, and an additional 80  hours to the expansion. As the gameplay loop never actually branches out, and if you think the combat branches out, there's a good game that actually makes combat branching, which is Divinity Original Sin utilizing more of the enviroment, weapons, scrolls, etc. for you to use. \n\nWitcher 3 just has so much redundancy and focus on graphics, that it's basically just another triple A game with the focus on textures, and not on gameplay, and not on the story as it's just another parent after \"adopted\" daughter story. And frankly, I think the expansion is quite worthless, and I've spent 4 digit hours on Warframe, and still get more fun, and even more story on that, whilst not even interested in Warframe's story. \n\nTL;DR: Either I'm a prick, or I critize the game harsher because of it being overrated beyond any game I've seen being overrated.", "timestamp_created": 1549667853, "timestamp_updated": 1549667853, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.348939627408981323", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48822490": {"recommendationid": "48822490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151088114", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1535339555}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is boring and overhyped, buy it on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1549545350, "timestamp_updated": 1549545350, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.32556489109992981", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49222749": {"recommendationid": "49222749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096748734", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1544131497}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know why everyone thinks so highly of this game.

I ended up buying it on the last sale for 20\u20ac, the GOTY edition, and I fired it up a few weeks ago after finding myself bored one night.\n\nThis game is probably the best game I've ever played. Everything, from the soundtrack to the story line, is spectacular.\nMaking a quick resum\u00e9 of the things that made me fall in love with this unique gem:\n\n-The graphics are insanely good, even more so with mods. The lightning is what every game's lightning strives to be.\n\n-The voice-work of the game. I am amazed at the amount of quality work put into this game; I heard over ten thousand lines, and not a single one of them seemed bad acted, at the contrary, *every single one* was stelar. Never broke the suspension of disbelief!\n\n-The choices. The choices matter, you forge your path. Sure, you might be a witcher, and in the canon sure as hell Geralt wouldn't send an innocent man to jail just because he's a tad bit racist, but fuck it, you're in control here, chief!\n\n-The feelings. I normally have a hard time immersing myself in stories, and they usually don't make me feel at all, but this game was totally different. I've smiled, I've laughed, and I almost cried too. The characters are so well acted and feel so real that you ought to *feel* it.\n\n-The soundtrack! I never thought, in my entire life, that I'd end up with polish folkloric music on my library, and look at me! It really grows on you.\n\n-GWENT. Either you LOVE it, or you hate it. I personally loved every second of it, and I enjoyed collecting cards so much! Kid is in danger? Fuck it, let's play gwent.\n\n-How even though the game is long, it doesn't feel long. Before playing this game, I was afraid that I'd feel obligated to pour dozens of hours of my life, countless days into it, without it really being that entertaining. NOPE. I've been entertained, every single one of my hours. Never got bored.\n\n-Uma.\n\nHonestly, if you're on the verge, and don't know if you might not like it, give it a shot. You might regret not getting it sooner, like I did. \n\nNot only the best game of the year, but also the best game I've ever played. I'll buy CD Projekt's next game in a heartbeat.\n\n70 hours to complete the main line, and I'm going to start the DLCs tomorrow!\n\nEDIT: Just completed the DLCs and loads of side quests at exactly 100 hours. \n\nI stand by my words, this is the best game I've ever played. I'm finsihed with it, but I'll probably replay this masterpiece in the future.\n\nI feel empty after completing this game. I know no game shall come close to this, and I know my adventures as Geralt are over.

I bought this game over a year ago and didn't get around to playing it until recently.

I've played good games and bad and in recent times have become rather annoyed at publishers that promote unfinished or badly flawed games on release, this however is not one of those products.  In fact, after i completed the game for the second time, I went to CD Projekt Red's web site to see what else they had on offer because if they produce quality like this then i'll gladly buy into their world.\nThe Witcher 3 is, to my mind, THE best game I have ever played.  Why?  Because, from the outset, even though I hadn't played Witcher 1 or 2, the main character was easy to understand and identify with.  The general gameplay is smooth and logical in addition to the gentle learning curve.  The plot, for someone that dives strait in to Witcher 3 is relatively easy to grasp, so much so that you quickly begin to feel part of it all.\nThe scariest thing is that it's a real emotional roller coaster, after a short while playing, you really begin to empathise with the characters, you'll be laughing out loud, feeling sad, angry and elated.  \nI could go on but suffice to say, it's Brilliant.

one thing (rare actually) i was scared to complete this game. When i was playing, completing mission after mission, i was think about end of the game and didn't want to see that, even to think about that. I was living this life, witcher life. I was traveled from village to village, from city to city, from forest to another forest. I met a lot of different , unique characters. Their voices, looks, demeanor , looks on world problems and world were different. Yes, it's unbelievable. In game you don't have the main mission - complete the game now. You can travel, look at all over places, beautiful places, landscapes, abandoned towers and castles, shattered camps . It's very atmospheric. I started using teleport only after 300 hours in this game. And now, when i finished the main story, i have plenty of the side-missions, contracts, and  thieves, bandits in my world. It's time to solve those misisons. When i was playing, i was full of emotions. I was like \"ohh, i want to be here, in this game\". On the weekends, i was making a 2 cups of a tea, closed door to my room and playing...or...lived? I'm still thinking, that my real life such a boring show... I was filled good emotions and worry. I was worrying about heroes.They became like a family to me. I felt that im part of this story. Now i'm writing review and i dont know my mood. It's a good and i think that something isn't completed yet. Why everything good have an end? Okay, those missions are for 50 more hours, but after that... The journey of the witcher isn't end. For me , this place - home. If i could change my life, choose any places to move to ( doesnt matter , move to place in real life or game ) i would like to live in this world. World which i like.\n\nAm i need to say something about graphics? About sound? \n*It's awesome. Everything in this game is awesome.\n\nThe only bad thing about this game - is the emptiness you feel, after finishing it. And thats true. \nYou know... Not each game can take your heart. This game did it. I mad about Witcher series, so, i'm gonna buy statuettes of all characters. I'm even thinking about to make other shelve, special for the witcher. It's unrealistic to explain your thoughts about something you love more than anything else. \nPerhaps, some of you guys will understand me , someone - not. But i want to tell you one thing - buy it, feel it. \nYou have to feel it on your experience. These emotions after this game it's like a storm you can't stop.\n\nI want to say big THANKS to the developers, to the CD PROJEKT. \nGuys, you are my favorite company. You gave me in this series more , than i got in my real life. Actually, every work week i was waiting the friday evening, run home and i knew, that now, for this weekend im finally free. And it was from week to week. And on these weekends i finished this game (main story). To be honest, i don't even know what i have to feel, i feel  emptiness. \nI really love you and thank you, CD PROJEKT. \n\nYou made the Masterpiece!", "timestamp_created": 1538851813, "timestamp_updated": 1543002013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 295, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.926246225833892822", "comment_count": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37056463": {"recommendationid": "37056463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056739666", "num_games_owned": 547, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 9117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1521285853}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b]An introduction[/b][/h1]\n\nThe Witcher 3 is certainly a game that has been hyped since it was released, and it still is, to some degree. I am sure that you've heard a lot about how this game is so great and blah blah blah. Sure, you can believe that and try the game yourself, but today I want to give you an honest review about what makes this game so loved. Buckle up, buckaroos.\n\n[h1][b]A quick look at the story[/b][/h1]\n\nAt a first glance, it seems that everybody plays this game because Geralt is so popular among the fans. He is, and with good reason. Geralt is a witcher: a monster hunter traveling the world far and wide in search of contracts on monsters only people like him can take down. He's got the full set: bombs, swords, potions that make him 10 times more badass than he already is, allies, etc. Witchers are trained to hunt monsters by passsing \"The Trial of Grasses\", a chemical procedure that injects potions into young boys to sharpen their senses, give them strength, speed, dexterity and the unforgetable cat eyes. \nThe full lore is, of course, way deeper than this quick explanation. From The Witcher 3 is about (I reccomend playing the Witcher 2 before this or at least reading some of the books, to understand the lore better since it can be a tad bit confusing at first) Geralt's odyssey to find Ciri and Yennefer, his \"daughter\" and his lover, in a race against time to save the world from The Wild Hunt and the White Frost. Going into the story anymore than this would mean spoiling the experience for you. Once you get to play the game though, you will experience for yourself the loveable characters, develop a bond with Geralt and feel like you are actually a part of the game's world.\n\n[h1][b]The gameplay[/b][/h1]\n\nThe game features classic rpg elements. The gameplay is pretty straightforward: you do quests to acquire better gear and level up, rinse and repeat. Even so, the side quests are not the basic \"go there, kill that many things, come back\" type of quests. They all have their each own unique little side story which gives the game even more flavour. They are memorable and fun, unlike other rpgs these days. \nThe main quests feature choices which leave a mark on the game's world and truly affect the story. The WItcher 3 also features treasure hunts for better gear and quests that you can actually fail, adding an overall more realistic feeling to the already complex game. \nThe map is huge, the vanilla version featuring 4 different regions. There is plenty to do other than explore. From finding easter eggs to clearing the places of interest on the map, I can guarantee you won't have time to be bored in this game. Other systems like crafting weapons and armor to forging runes are also a major component of the game, with Witcher armor sets blueprints to find and legendary weapons to forge or collect. Every artisan in the game's world has a certain level of experience and can only forge gear up to that point. To forge better and better gear, you must find the master and eventually grandmaster (in Blood and Wine) craftsmen.\n\n[h1][b]The combat system and skills[/b][/h1]\n\nThe Witcher 3 features a variety of skills and builds you can choose. Like wearing light armor and casting signs from afar? No problem! Like engaging in swordplay and slaying your enemies with graceful finishing moves? No problem! Like not even fighting? Sure thing, you can even control people's minds to do just that!\nThe plethora of ways in which you can play this game is most welcome, since it makes the game have a very high replayability value, both from a story perspective (you can experiment with choices and try to get different endings) and a gameplay perspective (even though you can change your build on the go with a Potion of Clearence which resets your skill points). \nThe game has quite a basic fighting system. You can get close and personal with the dual swords Geralt features (steel for men, silver for monsters) and either perform light/heavy attacks, parries and counter attacks (there are skills which expand the swordfighting with special moves and finishers) or you can fight from afar with signs like Igni, Yrden, Aard, you name it. The signs are powerful spells which can be modified by skills as well. Overall, the combat system feels great. You can also install mods (the community has plenty of them, especially on Nexus) to make the experience even better.\n\n[h1][b]Graphics and soundtrack[/b][/h1]\n\nThis game has absolutely beautiful graphics, which hold a place among the top even in 2017, almost 2 years and a half after its release. Everything from the grass to the monsters and rocks looks amazing! The soundtrack features masterfully composed music that fits just right in every situation, be it combat or just peacefully exploring the amazing map. \n\n[h1][b]The DLC[/b][/h1]\n\nThe two expansion packs, Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine feature so much content that they almost match the game time you get in the original version of the game. Hearts of Stone is a beautiful story about Olgierd von Everec, an immortal man who has been cursed with a heart of stone, whose content adds roughly 15 more hours of game time, and Blood and Wine even features a whole new region of the map to explore and complete quests in, which adds another 35 hours of game time. \nHearts of Stone features a whole new crafting system called enchanting, which allows you to enchant your gear with the help of a runewright. In Blood and Wine, all crafting systems are expanded with Grandmaster craftsmen, which can forge grandmaster armor and weapons. Just like the main game, the expansion packs are also full of choices and can have different endings. If you have your mind set on buying the game, go for the GOTY version.\n\n[h1][b]Conclusion[/b][/h1]\n\nThis game is a masterpiece in my opinion. It satisfies all of the gamer's needs a modern rpg should satisfy, while also offering endless hours of playtime and replay value. If you are at the very least interested in rpgs, you will enjoy this and immediately fall in love with the wonderful cast of characters, making you want to play the game more and more. It also has that unique je ne sais quois that no other game can match. The current price of the game is a solid deal, guys (20$). I reccomend buying it.

My time played is bordering on embarassing, and its going to get worse with BaW just released. This is my comfort game, whenever I am bored of another game, I can always come back to this one. I also played through W1 and W2 multiple times (not on Steam) so I was foaming at the mouth for years, waiting for this game.\n\nI'm the kind of gamer where I need more than just a story, I want a great story, great loot/crafting/item management, great combat, and great character RPG skill building. This game has it all, and its completely adjustable. Only want the story and swinging your sword at monsters but dont want to get into crafting/alchemy/skills? Just play it on the easiest and you can skip all of that, and just watch the story (Naughty dog/telltale style). You want to get hardcore and make all the crafting/oils/bombs/potions/thought into char build usefull? Turn it on Death march and make all your desisions count and make all the battles extremely fun and tacticle. 4 of my 5 playthroughs are on DM and it is the true Witcher 3 experience.\n\nGames with great stories alone just dont cut it for me anymore. A good example of this recently was Uncharted 4, dont get me wrong it had a great story, but after the Witcher I was bored to tears and still havent finished it. In that game you do nothing but shoot at stuff and watch the story, which is fine for some people but not me. In Witcher 3 you get a GOT quality of a story, including voice acting, animation, ect. However when you want to take a break from that, visit one of the equally engaging side stories and monster hunts, go on scavenger hunts for treasure and 6 different sets specialized witcher gear, 4 of which have 5 tiers of upgrades. Go visit question marks on the map for more side stories and treasures, hunt down rare ingredients for your potions/bombs/oils. Theres all of that and I havent even talked about Gwent yet....  You will also be collecting cards rare and common through out the game world for an entire card game built from the ground up as a mini game within this game. The game is so fucking good that they are now releasing it as a full game because everyone went ape shit nuts for it. Ive played so much Gwent that I know what the computer is going to do before they even do it.\nI could go on and on, but bottom line.......this game has set a new mark in all the gaming industry for other compaines to aspire to. CDPR for fucking life.\n\nPros:\nEverything, it has it all. This is the equivelent of gaming super crack\n- Great char building and skill trees, even better now with BaW DLC\n- A very well done and responsive battle system that gets even more fun and tacticle as you turn up the difficulty. The only *sword fight simulator* that is better is Dark Souls.\n- Tons of weapons, armor, and crafting, including all the Witcher specialized sets that change their look with each upgrade.\n- One of the greatest game stories ive ever seen, which may have only been topped by its own DLC in Hearts of Stone. Top notch voice acting, animation, and choice/dialog system.\n- Fucking Gwent\n- A vast living, breathing open world only rivaled by GTAVs open world for scope and detail.\n- Details, details, details, a huge amount of love and time were poured into this game. I spend hours just looking at stuff and admiring all the little things.  (see hours played)\n\nCons:\nIt will ruin all other games for you. Everything else is now harder to get in to because of this. So, you know.......be careful", "timestamp_created": 1464882116, "timestamp_updated": 1497245612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 946, "votes_funny": 182, "weighted_vote_score": "0.929924249649047852", "comment_count": 42, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25911236": {"recommendationid": "25911236", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995675400", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 8741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496724247}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm the kind of person who doesn't like to hand out superlatives like \"best\". Normally whenever you try to unpack \"best\", it's normally hard to quantify, or at worst, empty rhetoric.\n\nThat's why I was so surprised with myself. Around ten hours into The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, a question popped into my head. \"Is this the best game I've ever played?\" I tried to dismiss it, re-frame it into something more subjective, but the question wouldn't go away. So I decided, \"what the hell, I'll finish the game and ask myself that question again.\"\n\nNow that I've finished the story, well... I think it is. From start to finish, Witcher 3 stands a full head and shoulders above every RPG I've played in almost every metric that matters to me. It has the most fully realized open world I've ever experienced. Its story and characters are deep and compelling. The game is immersive in ways I still can hardly believe. Its visuals are breathtaking, the music is fantastic. The amount of content--meaningful content, not flavorless side quests--is staggering.\n\n[b]The World[/b]\nThe current trend in open-world games seems to be using procedural generation to offer playable areas that are more than anyone could successfully explore in a lifetime. But I'm sure you've played a few games that promise this and deliver a world that's wide as the ocean and shallow as a puddle. Witcher 3 is the opposite of this. Every inch of Velen, Novigrad, and Skellige that you encounter is lovingly crafted. This is one of the only games I've played besides Elder Scrolls games where you can literally set off in a random direction and find self-sustaining adventure.\ntl;dr: better game than no man's sky/10\n\n[b]Narrative/Characters[/b]\nThe main story is fantastic. The world of the Witcher is noticeably cynical, and the game uses this to its advantage. The story's conflict hinges around very adult fears and uses very adult themes to drive these points home. You spend the vast majority of the game looking for Ciri, Geralt's adopted daughter. She's not held in some magic crystal, trapped but otherwise safe--you don't know what's happened to her, all you can do is search and hope for the best.\nThe characters you meet, both supporting characters and general NPCs, are excellent. They're well-written, well-voiced, and well-animated, and it's a joy listening to them and hearing more about their stories.\nThe story is branching, but the amazing part is that I can't tell you by how much. Normally, it's readily apparent in games with choices where exactly the story branches, but this game does an excellent job at hiding the seams. The consequences of your decisions aren't readily apparent until sometimes hours of playtime after you make them.\ntl;dr: feels/10\n\n[b]Immersion[/b]\nI read reviews before buying this, and people kept saying the game was \"immersive\".\nI didn't believe that at first, but after playing the game, I can confirm that it's the strongest point of the game. You really do feel like Geralt of Rivia, an itinerant monster slayer who often gets wrapped up in things larger than the Path he walks. You feel like you have his powers--superhuman senses, reflexes, and an encyclopedic knowledge of supernatural monsters that the commonfolk only know in myths.\nThe game is huge on player agency, allowing you to use what you know to solve problems as best you can. It's hard not to feel immersed when you're using your Witcher Senses to identify distant threats by sound.\n[i][b]Immersive Narrative[/b][/i]\nAfter you've played a lot of games that allow you to make decisions, you start recognizing tropes. \"If you unlock a special dialogue option, take it--nothing bad will happen.\" \"If someone tells you they're misunderstood, they normally are.\" Very early in the game, I let rules like this influence my decision, and the game slapped my wrist for it. I blinked, but I didn't listen and tried again on a more major plot point. The game punched me in the dick. After that, I stopped trusting people at face value. I became willing to refuse people who I thought were lying to me. I started making decisions as Geralt of Rivia, instead of someone playing a video game. I almost always play RPGs as Neutral Good, doing what I think is right and helping everyone I possibly can whether they deserve it or not. The fact that a game could make me change this is absolutely massive.\ntl;dr: i'm a witchman/10\n\n[b]Content[/b]\nI already talked about how much there is to do in the world, but it deserves a special mention that this game is priced at $50. My total runtime for completion of the main story quest and maybe 60-70% of sidequests and exploration was around 120 hours. None of that time was grinding for money, experience, anything of the sort--just pure adventure. I've played AAA games for $60 that didn't have 1/4th the content this one does. Not to mention, the myriad of free DLC the game comes with, and the absolutely massive expansion packs that I've, at the time of this writing, just barely dipped my toes in. It really boggles the mind and makes you wonder what some of these other video game companies even think they're doing. After playing this game, if it was priced at $90 or even $100, I'd still say it was worth it. And I didn't even mention Gwent.\ntl;dr: i owe CD Projekt Red money/10\n\n[b]Audio/Visual[/b]\nThe game is beautiful and runs exceptionally. I don't normally focus on graphics because it's more important to me that a game have a defined visual style, but Witcher 3 has one and it's beautiful. The music is excellent as well, carrying the desperation of life in Velen, the somber song of Skellige, and the carefree life (for some) of Novigrad. \n\n[b]Combat[/b]\nThis is the only part of the game that doesn't sparkle as brightly. It almost doesn't feel fair to say that, as combat in this game is very good, it just didn't dazzle me like the rest. I began to outlevel the foes I'd encounter while exploring, which trivialized combat. The game has a very good crafting and skill system to bolster your combat, but when the combat itself didn't stress me, I didn't feel much of a need to come up with clever solutions to problems. I've upped the difficulty for my playthrough of the expansions, so if I need to adjust this section later, I will.\n\nAll in all, this game is a masterwork. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes RPGs even a little bit. And for the foreseeable future, if anyone asks me what the best game I've ever played is, I will say the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.", "timestamp_created": 1475872109, "timestamp_updated": 1475872109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 132, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.891816616058349609", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25474159": {"recommendationid": "25474159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005656654", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 9815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473686081}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is more than another blockbuster title; it's one of those that defined a chapter in my life. \n\nI played Witcher 1 when it was released in 2007, back when I was a single man working in my first job few years out of college.

Hearing how CD PROJEKT RED decided to go \"open-world\" and make the game 30 times larger than the previous Witcher games. These games were always more about substance for me and \"open-world\" games tend to lose some of that. I wasn't so sure it would work. Then, the game then was delayed in 2014. Wasn't a good sign for me. \n\nSoon after it was released, I picked it up. I spent the first few hours just taking in how beautiful and detailed the game world is. The water, trees, animals, grass..everything felt alive. I started playing the game and got hooked. The main questline itself was full of characters you grow to love and care about and a story that you typically don't get in a video game. The side quests in the game weren't your typical \"fetch this\" or \"Kill this\" type..all of them had a story and decisions to make on how to complete them.\n\nThe combat seemed clunky at first but then you start to realize this isn't a button mashing game, patience and timing was the way to go. It can be on the easy side on the normal difficulty levels, especially when only using your sword for combat but it gets more interesting when you start to use alchemy and signs. \n\nIn the end, I couldn't believe how great of a game this ended up being. The game's production values and writing are some of the best I've ever seen. Although I spent 150+ hours in my first playthrough of this game, I was bummed it was ending.

You heard it at lest 100 times. But I am here to tell you why. [/b]\nLet's start with story. It's set in medieval fantasy word filled up with every creature from farytales you can think of and it's amazing. It's very exciting from start to end. It has some weaker points here and there, but It's still pretty solid. The story telling, cut scenes and voice acting are just perfect. This game has tons of side quests to offer. But it's not just simple 'Bring me something' or 'kill something'. Every quest has it's own story and different ways to complete it. Some of them are pretty funny to do too. Yes, you have lots of monster killing quests, but every time it's different type of monster, so you must use different type of tactics to kill it. The game world is HUGE. It's seperated into 2 bigger maps(Velen, Skelliege) and 3 smaller maps(White Orchard, Kaer Morhen and Castle at Wizyma). Every area has different coloring, music, nature, people and monsters. It's completely different worlds. Every world live it's own life. You can see day and night cycle, wildlife, villagers doing their daily routines, monsters hunting animals, weather changes and people yelling at you. It feels like you are in real world, not just in some randomly generated areas. Graphics are awesome even today. Everything has so much detail, sunsets are breathtaking and landscape is beautifully generated. The World has some bugs, but not any significant ones. RPG aspect of the game is great too. You have many skill trees to upgrade, lots of armours and swords to gain/craft/buy and tons of crafting materials. You can even collect herbs to make potions or bombs. You can drink these potions or use bombs in fight too. You can even buy seat, bags and blinkers for your horse.  Money si problem only at the start of the game, later, they are not a problem (unless you want to make every witcher gear armour in the game.). The biggest problem of the game is your horse Roach. She stucks at every tree and she can't go down hill. I know developers made fun of it, even at some quests, but it's still annoying. The Witcher 3 offers 3 mini games such as Gwent - very exciting card game with hours of fun, fist fighting and horse racing. You can join tournaments and win titules of champion and some valuable prizes. DLCs are not just regular dlcs. They're almots as big as standalone games. They have different, new and great story. Blood and Wine has It's own new world. If you want to beat the game without dlcs, but with every quest and area completed it will take you 150-175 hrs. With both dlcs, prepare to spend around 250 hrs in game.  \n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Exciting story from start to end\n[*]Beautifully designed characters (with nice curves)\n[*]Unique and entertaining side quests\n[*]Great RPG acpects\n[*]Living world with awesom graphics\n[*]Diversity of individual areas\n[*]Nice voice acting and sound\n[*]Fantastic dialogues with characters\n[*]Original and huge dlcs\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Very few bugs in world\n[*]Some glitches in cutscenes\n[*]Roach problems\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\nThe Witcher 3 is truly best RPG made in past years, maybe the best RPG ever made.

It\u2019s the third part in the videogame series based on the books by Andrzej Sapkowski and represents the end of the famous videogame trilogy of Geralt of Rivia, a.k.a the White Wolf or the Butcher of Blaviken. To cut a long story short: The game lived up to every expectation I had and exceeded them with ease. Even the games\u2018 minigames are better than many full-price titles \u2013 yeah exactly, I\u2019m talking about you Gwent, you awful little drug that I can\u2019t get enough of\u2026\n\nThe main story connects to the events of the second Witcher game 'Assassins of Kings\u2018 and brings the overall story started in the first part to an end. Witchers are infamous monster hunters, magically improved mutants that are simultanesously feared and needed in a world threatened by dark creatures, evil spirits and living nightmares. Geralt of Rivia is a famous specimen of this kind and thought for a long time that his former friend and love, the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg, was already dead. However during the recent events in Loc Muinne he learned that this was not the entire truth and so he decides to start a new journey to finally find answers to his questions.\n \nA huge world with fascinating lore and characters awaits the White Wolf - the sheer quantity of places you can visit, persons you can talk to and monsters that have to be slain would be enough to  fit in several other games. \nThis world is not only packed with interesting stories, dialogues, quests, fearsome monsters and an insane amount of details behind every corner, moreover it is convincing and far away from all the happy fantasy clich\u00e9s you've already seen a hundred times. There is neither black nor white, just many shades of grey. Elves are neither the glorious archers nor the kind tree people, humans not the friendly guys that accept every race the same and dwarfes are no gentle stone-loving miners. In this world you have to make choices that you won\u2019t like and to live with the consequences. Morally ambiguous is the description you\u2019re looking for.\n__________________________________________\n\n[h1]Graphics and Audio[/h1]\n\nRegarding the technical aspects this game conquers Mount Olympus easily (despite the much complained 'technical downgrade\u2018) as it is one of the most beautiful RPGs I\u2019ve ever seen, with amazing sunsets/sunrises, spooky nights and gorgeous views over detailled landscapes full of nature and terror - this game is definitely gorgeous. \n\nYou want to see some examples? Let me show you some screenshots taken from the game using Reshade/E3FX and the free camera from the console:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=639380403\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=657195325\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=626638385\n\nIn addition to the stunning visuals there is also brilliant music and fantastic voice acting that will catch you during dialogues or pumps you up during the fights. Together with the exquisite characters, the superb dialogues and all the deep little stories the game suceeds even more in creating a credible fantasy world.\n__________________________________________\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\nSo now there's the question: Are there negative points at all? \nYeah some minor flaws: Talking to every person and looting every stash is kind of unsatisfying as there is no wide variety of things that you may accomplish or find this way, so after some time you will visit mostly the important places and persons while ignoring the rest. Furthermore if everything else may be a 10/10 for me, the fighting mechanic is not as fantastic as the rest. It has definitely improved since the second part but it\u2019s still somewhat 'special' as it lacks unique aspects, a good feedback for the hits and suffers every now and then from targeting problems, camera angles, weird controls or some questionable hitboxes. \nThat now may sound worse than it actually is - from my point of view it's 'still' an 8 out of 10. In addition I encountered some small visual glitches and sound errors during cutscenes but they were so small and disappeared after reloading, so I don\u2019t even care about this at all. Compared to the games\u2018 size and content there are nearly no problems at all and everything runs more than just smoothly for me. \n\nTo be honest there is only only real downside that I have with the game: My journey with Geralt will end some day and it set new standards regarding characters, lore and dialogues that future RPGs have to be compared with - and this will be a tough struggle for many of them.\n__________________________________________\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nSo in the end, would I recommend the game? Yes \u2013 and no. \nIt\u2019s a fantastic RPG with an amazing amount of content, exquisite characters, dialogues and interesting stories, so I\u2019d recommend it for everyone who has even the slightest positive attitude towards RPGs or the fantasy genre in general. \nHowever at the same time I wouldn\u2019t recommend the game for anyone who has only little time to spare, doesn\u2019t want to be immersed in a massive world full of lore or just wants to rush the story - this game needs time. A lot of time. However it pays off by providing a brilliant experience that will take you on a journey that you\u2019ll never regret or forget...\n\n\u2026or to be more precise let's call it 'a journey you\u2019d like to forget'. Just to experience this masterpiece again from the start and to get these great feelings again (damn I even ignored the fast-travel option and turned off the minimap and the quest hints willingly for many hours (I\u2019ve been lost so many times) to enjoy the world and the quests even longer). \n\nI rate it gladly 9.5 out of 10 points.\n__________________________________________\n\nLet's end this review with another badass quote of the White Wolf:\n'I'm a Witcher.

I'll make an exception with Witcher 3. This game is just as good as every media outlet and amateur reviewer says it is. It might actually be, all things considered, the best game I've ever played. All of the hype you've heard is real. If that's all that matters to you, pick the game up right now. Read on for a bit more detail.\n\nThis game creates an experience that's far more than the sum of its parts. The excellent visuals and music, the lovely sound design, and the painstakingly well-crafted environments, NPCs, and quest and dialogue writing all combine to give this game a lived-in, realistic feel that very few games have been able to exhibit. Every corner of the world feels real. There's so much to experience across the several maps that you can simply wander from place to place for hours upon end, taking in all that there to experience. None of this is procedurally generated, either. It's all hand-crafted, and for those willing to look, there are some incredible things to find.\n\nEarly in the game, the player character Geralt meets a gungho historian off to chronicle the war. Geralt tells him not to go, that the warzone is a chaotic, anarchic wasteland and he'll be killed simply for the quality of his boots. The historian laughs it off, and offers to play a Gwent cardgame with Geralt. If Geralt wins, he can win a unique card from this NPC. Later in the game Geralt and Vesimir find themselves underneath a tree full of hanged civilians. Upon searching the foot of the tree, Geralt can find a half-finished history book, and the Gwent card the historian was carrying if it wasn't won from him earlier. The entire game is littered with moments like these; very subtle, missable details that only a minority of players will experience, yet CDPR has worked hard to place in the game anyway because they truly care about the depth of their world. I've played it through to completion several times and each time I find something new.\n\nThe quality of writing is so good that it will propel you to finish the game regardless of whether or not you like the combat. The characters are so likeable that you'll grow attached to them before too long, and the quality dialogue and voice acting makes the plot points hit that much harder. The unique thing about this game is not so much the quality of its writing, as there are quite a few games with solid writing, but the depth to which this quality of writing goes. From the main questline to the most minor sidequest, you can always expect to be pleasantly surprised. I was hooked by the very first monster hunting sidequest in White Orchard when you discover just [i]why[/i] this Noonwraith is roaming around the well in this small village. Each NPC seems to have a lovingly crafted backstory of their own, and even the most minor fetch quest has its own wrinkle to make it interesting. The high quality of these quests is even more impactful in a world of Mass Effect Andromeda's with their disposable, MMO inspired, procedurally generated fetch-quests. They don't make them like this anymore. This is a game in which the most minor sidequest you take on will take you nearly an hour, and it will make you stop and think about a dilemma, or a question it poses, through its quest writing. It's amazing just how much quality content the writing team put into this game. Nothing is disposable, everything in the game serves to garner an emotional reaction or ask an important question. It's packed to the brim with quality content to experience.\n\nThe most criticzed aspect of this game is the combat, which I actually find to be quite enjoyable. I recently finished my first Death March playthrough and I found the challenge to be quite satisfying. I very rarely felt cheated, never had to cheese the game to get past a particularly difficult section. The difficulty was very well balanced and I felt a strong sense of accomplishment upon completion. The abilities scale very well, going from utility in the beginning to being overpowered within the game world if you focus solely on improving one aspect. Aard, my favorite ability, becomes an absolute world-wrecker if you continue to improve it, allowing you to force blast a small city of enemies at its highest levels. All other abilities are equally useful, and they allow you to build Geralt in whichever way you choose without feeling like you're missing out on anything. Very few RPGs are as balanced as this one is. The combat itself is enjoyable as well, requiring quick dodges and counters the way you would expect a witcher to fight. Each monster type is unique and requires its own strategies, allowing you to fall back into similar patterns whenever you face one type, but there are enough different types of monsters that you'll never face one type for long enough to get bored. To me, the humans were always the most challenging.\n\nWhen it first released there was some talk of graphics downgrades, bugs, and obtuse UI. However CDPR have completely eliminated all of these issues with the most extensive round of post-release patching I've ever seen for a game. Every major bug I remember encountering has been eliminated from the game, it looks phenomenal and runs very well, and the UI flows like a dream whether you're using mouse and keyboard or a controller. In addition to this they added a ton of free DLC, so make sure you've got all that stuff set to download after you purchase the game.\n\nTo top all of this off, this game has the best DLC offerings I've ever seen in a video game, period. Better than Minerva's Den, better than Lair of the Shadow Broker. The writing in Hearts of Stone is the best I've ever seen in a DLC, and is the high point of the entire Witcher series in my opinion. And the sheer amount of content added in Blood and Wine is mind-boggling. If you buy Witcher 3, buy the Game of the Year edition without any second thoughts.\n\nThis is a game you'll put hundreds of hours into without regret. You'll be missing the characters long after you've finished it. Any time you hear a music track from the game on YouTube you'll immediately become nostalgic for the game. Witcher 3 is truly a towering achievement in every sense of the term, it's one of the very few games in which I can't find anything to criticze. It's an absolute masterpiece, and no matter what types of games you enjoy, you should buy it and give it a shot.

The story is beatifully crafted and intresting to play. The combat is fun and has the right amount of challenge, along with awsome spells you use. Plus the combinations of making potions and armors/swords makes this a solid combat system with variety. What really got me about this game is the choices you have to make. The choices I made really made me think if the choice I chose was really the right choice. All the choices in this game are morally grey, just like real life. This reminded of when I played Mass Effect for the first time, but with so much more depth and detail. The soundtrack is excellent and really gets you involved in the game. Overall this is just a good damn game that deserves your 60$. The developers, CD Project Red actually care about the fans and making a fantastic game. So a round of applause to the developers for caring about us the fans instead of screwing us over. Overall I fully recommend this game if your are a RPG lover and want a game with quality and love put into it.\n\nFinal Score: 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1533609821, "timestamp_updated": 1542564249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 163, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.889361441135406494", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42017208": {"recommendationid": "42017208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015642770", "num_games_owned": 973, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 25345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1532822324}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not sure it's possible to make a better game than this.", "timestamp_created": 1526215563, "timestamp_updated": 1526215563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 573, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.906690895557403564", "comment_count": 37, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33733668": {"recommendationid": "33733668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118075697", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 5251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518624520}, "language": "english", "review": "One of those games where you want to forget the entire thing so you can go through it again. \n\nI believe that is the highest praise I can give to any form of entertainment.", "timestamp_created": 1500773079, "timestamp_updated": 1500773079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 269, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.90236508846282959", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48643890": {"recommendationid": "48643890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098256707", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 3236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550110737}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]this game's been out for about 4 years now, there's 170k total reviews, and only around 4k of those are negative. if that's not a reason to say this game's amazing, i dont know what is.[/h1]\n\nthe graphics are [b]stunning[/b], especially if you have enhancement mods.\n\nthe gameplay is amazing all around.\n\nthe devs are really supportive of the fanbase & community.\n\ncombat is 10/10\n\nstory is one of the best out there, [h1]i'd even put it next to metal gear on a ranking list.[/h1] it's that good (and i havent even played through a quarter of it as of me writing this review, im too busy having fun!)\n\n[h1]infinitely replayable.[/h1]\n\nsoundtrack is [b]god-tier[/b], in most games you'd get burnt out on the repeating songs, but TW3 changes this making you listen more the more you hear it.\n\nvoice acting is amazing, it puts you into a trance.\n\nthe environment is unparalleled.\n\nthe list goes on & on.\neven if you don't like games similiar to this, read the line below. im not usually a fan of games like the witcher, but this... hit me a different way.\n[b]buy this game, play it through, then buy it again & repeat the cycle\n\nalso the dlcs only have like 40 negative reviews.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1548846201, "timestamp_updated": 1548846272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 274, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.894513845443725586", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28320427": {"recommendationid": "28320427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024817259", "num_games_owned": 805, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 16083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485675452}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so spot on in so many areas that it's hard to review.

Every why and every question you might have pertaining to the story will be answered by reading the novels.

Not a perfect game, but very close to it, performance left a lot to be desired and the bug list was shocking to be perfectly honest.. exceeded - if not matched - only by the likes of Obsidian and Bethesda, and that simply should not happen in this day and age. The UI was merely passable in some instances and downright terrible in others and, sadly, the levelled-loot was made utterly worthless due to the expansive crafting system in the game.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has got to be one of the greatest single player games I've ever played, and that is from somebody that is not accustomed to the previous two titles. \n\nWith so many areas to talk about, I'll first mention about game dialogue. Considering an average novel is between 80,000 and 100,000 words, the script to Witcher 3 accumulates to a 450,000 word goliath. Unbelievable! It requires over 950 speaking roles, which reportedly took more than two and a half years to successfully accomplish. Whats slightly more incredible then those statistics, is that Witcher 3 makes you feel like you [u]don't[/u] want to skip any of it whatsoever, through an amalgamation of whit, thrill, mystery, passion and more. I've never known a game to deliver dialogue so well, but on top of that its you that gets the choice of how the story goes. Your in control! You can continue to show Geralt as the renowned warrior he is, or you can often show his softer side in certain situations. There is no right or wrong. Even towards the latter stages, Co-developer Marcin Iwinski announced that there are 36 possible endings for the game, mind = blown. \n\nThe environment to Witcher 3 is also a great achievement in itself. To put it into perspective, the map is 20% larger than Skyrim. Its also 35 times larger than the map found in Witcher 2. A large map is a good feat on its own, but these facts give CD Projekt Red massive bragging rights! At first it felt like the environment was very much going to be the same throughout, and I was really wondering whether or not there would be massive differences later on. As it turns out there is so much more in the lands of Witcher 3 to explore, in which I was extremely keen to find for myself. \n\nYou get to see a lot of the world through the storyline, but stepping away from that and doing side quests & contracts are where you can find yourself in extraordinary circumstances. I can't honestly tell you another game thats genuinely made me want to do [u]everything[/u]. Each side quest feels like a mini-storyline, you don't seem to get any that follow a tedious or repetitive nature. On one side of the spectrum you could be fighting the biggest and deadliest creatures that Velen and Skellige have to offer, then on the other side you'll be hunting treasure, balls deep in Nekker swamps.\n\nYou'll more then likely reach a few points in the game where you are overburdened with side quests, treasure hunts and contracts. It can sometimes lead to confusion, but the easiest way to clear your Journal is to go through them one by one. Obviously due to level restrictions, some of them cannot be completed until Geralt is stronger - which doesn't mean you can't try to do them, it just means that it will be incredibly difficult to do so. One moment that I will always remember is when I went to fight a Royal Griffin that was 12 levels higher then me. I would spend a long time evading damage and trying to deliver some form of pain, but its almost like the Griffin was laughing at me, all I seemed to do was shave feathers off its back, nothing more. Then in one foul swoop, I'd be dead. Repeat. Dead. Repeat. Dead. Shit. I'm one that embraces difficulty, playing on the hardest setting in this game is fantastic, yet this was a battle that I [u]had[/u] to swallow my pride and leave. Go away. Get stronger. Come back, and rip that fucking bird to pieces. This was great, not many times have I been in a situation where a game would allow me to fight a much higher level, you tend to get games match the enemies strength based on your current level. With this said, I actually much preferred Witcher 3's approach, it created some great and memorable fight scenes where I wouldn't necessarily assume victory. Certain areas are swamped with much higher creatures early on, so returning to them 50+ hours later provides a nice feeling of self accomplishment and power. \n\nNow I remember all those years ago, playing cards in a big Saloon in Red Dead Redemption. Poker, Blackjack, maybe a little bit of Five Finger Fillet or Liar's Dice. These were wonderful times. Now I have a new love, playing Gwent. Gwent is a collectable card game that simulates two armies meeting on the battlefield. \"Invented by dwarves and perfected over centuries of tavern table play, Gwent is a game of initial simplicity and ultimate depth, something beloved by both road-weary travellers during long nights around the campfire and elegant nobles looking to liven up dragging dinner parties.\" I have no idea how much time I've spent playing Gwent in this game, all I can say is that 25 hours into this game I was Level 3. 3! Gwent immediately took my focus as I attempted to gain recognition throughout Velen. Its a continous side quest in the game, challenging notable opponents and entering tournaments, not only that but also every merchant is up for a game. Just when you think your building a great deck and come out of a tournament as the winner, a local fishmonger will always be ready to embarass you (early on anyway, it becomes a breeze later on in game). There is also a quest to collect them all, so enjoy your time hunting for all 150 cards spread through the factions of Nilfgaard, Northen Realms, Monsters & Scoia'tael. \n\nI've always enjoyed games that heavily involve fighting, particularly when the mechanisms are right. I have heard mixed  reviews about the mechanisms to Witcher 3 combat, some arguing that Geralt feels particularly stiff and robotic when under attack... absolute garbage. I think combat can be pretty tricky in Witcher 3 for those unfamiliar with the series, considering the many different mechanics in play at any one time. Blocking, parrying, signs, pivots, rolls, variant of sword, etc. Practice makes perfect, and it is different to other games so get used to it! Thats all I can say. Dismemberment is always a joy to behold, and Geralt doesn't hold back on his capability to carve through people, creatures and monsters like butter.\n\nCould this game have anything to make it better? Yes & it does - Free DLC. Not just a few, but 16! 16 Free DLC packages to add even more into a well-packed game. CD Projekt Red have had the best launch I've seen of a game, in terms of its update structure and responsiveness to people's comments. From launch there was new DLC every week, patches to address issues and bugs retaining in-game. Free DLC includes new armor sets, the ability to visit a barber, new quests, contracts, animations, alternative looks, and not to forget the NEW GAME + mode. \n\nI put this review on hold numerous of times as it deserved to be reviewed once completed, it truly is a remarkable and well made game that will forever have the highest of impacts on me. Its groundbreaking in every sense of the word, and literally pisses all over certain companies that think its right to strip a new game of content then release it as paid DLC.

This is the greatest RPG I've ever played. I've used Steam for many years now, and never written a review for a game before...this game was good enough to make me feel like I should.\n\nLooking back on it, I feel like I actually played several games. The overall storyline contained so many sub-plots that each \"chapter\" felt like its own complete game. I've heard some people mention this as a negative, but I can't possibly see how. It's value...you don't have to play the game if you don't want to. If you only want 40 hours of content from a AAA title, then quit playing it after 40 hours.\n\nAs for the quests themselves, I found even the random mini-quests generated from \"undiscovered locations\" to be well-executed and thoughtful, some of which would only take a few minutes to complete, but added genuine character to the gaming world, making it feel like a real place. After over 170 hours of play, I found myself saving the final quest and just roaming around Skellige checking out undiscovered locations, even though I knew the vast majority of them were smugglers caches, and I already had all the gear and crowns I could ever use...I didn't want it to end. I anxiously await the next DLC expansion.\n\nI hear a lot of people complain about the combat system as well, and for the life of me I can't understand why. In close quarters the camera gets a bit wonky, and it's hard to maneuver properly because of your view being obstructed, but that's only in a few specific places. The combat system is elegant in that it is as complex as you make it. You can finish the game quite easily doing nothing but blocking/countering if your opponent is human, dodge/attack if your opponent is a monster. Now add to this basic and extremely effective routine the use of the various bombs, potions, decoctions, and signs, especially in conjunction with area effects and each other...there are a thousand ways to defeat your opponents. Throwing a gas bomb and lighting up a bunch of bandits with Igni is always entertaining, as is using Axii to make a guy kill his buddy. Some special attacks you can unlock, like Whirl, are just amazing to watch when you pull it off correctly to take out a whole group of enemies in one fantastic display of swordsmanship.\n\nGwent is another feature that gets a lot of attention, and I really didn't know what to make of it at first. After analyzing it for a little while, and picking up some different cards with different abilities, I began to realize the genius of it, and eventually got to the point where I can honestly say I haven't had as much fun with an RPG mini-game since Triple Triad in FF8. It's just another part of this game that is absolutely brilliant in its simplicity yet astoundingly deep.\n\nWell, there you go. My first Steam review.

Here are just some of the many reasons as to why this game is so great:\n\nPROS:\n\n[b]The Leading Man[/b] - Something has to be said about our main protagonist - he's an absolute badass reminiscent to that of Solid Snake. From his scar-riddled body to his gruff and gravelly voice every ounce of him oozes cool. I want to be him. Women want him. On initial impressions you might think he will turn out to be a monotone bore, void of personality but this also couldn't be further from the truth. Geralt can always manage to deliver great lines of dialogue from witty quips to interesting introspectives. In truth he is a great leading man.\n\n[b]Game Within A Game[/b] - While some games like to add some extra little minigames to their game that can prove to be entertaining for a couple of minutes at best Witcher 3 went the extra mile and added Gwent - a fully fleshed out card game that adds dozens and dozens of hours of extra gameplay. This card game itself is entirely optional within the game, but whole sidequests go unfulfilled should you choose to ignore it - which you really shouldn't - because it's a lot of fun. Northern Realms is best deck!\n\n[b]The Writing[/b] - There's always a special place in my heart for games that manage to give a choice of not black and white options - but the all too common and ever uncertain options of grey. You know, the choices that don't have a clear cut good answer or bad answer. The choices which, all to often is going to hurt SOMEONE. Witcher 3 has plenty of these and even goes the extra mile of luring you into a \"good\" choice only for outcomes to go horribly wrong. It makes me question my choice, makes me feel bad, makes me reload previous saves, makes me love it all the more.\n\n[b]A Good Looker[/b] - Straight up this game is GEORGEOUS! There have been plenty of times where I've just stopped in a beautiful glade or mountainpass and just thought \"Wow\" as I take it all in. Even the cutscenes in the game can be so pretty, the characters even have their intricate little flaws and detals like tiny marks, bumps and cuts on their skin and faces. I can only appreciate the sheer amount of work that went into making a game of this beauty. \n\n[b]The Celtic Influence[/b] - Ok this one, well I'm Irish so I can already appreciate the heck out of it. It's blatent celtic cultural influence is just a joy to see and makes me think of a simpler time. Props to the Witcher 3 staff hiring Scottish & Northern Irish voice actors for basically the entire populous of Ard Skellige. \n\nI could also mention other things like how the game does a great job of handling lore of fantasy - delving into a whole host of mytical creatures or how the fighting mechanics of Witcher are a technical joy, having to read up on creatures weaknesses and using useful concoctions in the heat of battle are a must for higher difficulties, but I won't say anymore I can't praise this game enough - PLAY IT.\n\nCONS: \n\nHaha, no.", "timestamp_created": 1486938230, "timestamp_updated": 1486988168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 472, "votes_funny": 44, "weighted_vote_score": "0.898198366165161133", "comment_count": 20, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38802647": {"recommendationid": "38802647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212147824", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 220437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12114, "last_played": 1551876021}, "language": "english", "review": "Here's a short review of the Witcher 3, arguably one of the best if not the best rpg I've played of all time.\n\nI actually had to decide until now if I should get this game or not, because I was afraid it was just overhyped, but  BOIII how wrong I was. I regret that I only played it now, but boy, oh boy, this game is fuckin good.\n\nPros: \nThe world: Which is the game's strongest point, not only is it huge but it is also alive and changes depending on your decision throughout the game. Not gonna get into it much to avoid spoilers.\n\nCombat: While simplified it still required a bit of tactic, especially on death march, P.S Aard ftw. This was why Witcher 1 and especially 2 were hard to get into due to their ridicilous combat mechanics and difficulty, not to mention the controls back then were clunky too, so thanks CDPR.\n\nStory: While the story follows a basic narractive of \"Go save this and do that\" the way it is being told is amazing, especially the characters which made the journey even more memorable\n\nDLC: The dlc is so good they feel like a completely new game themselves, especially blood and wine, not to mention they also give people free DLC, are the dlc's worth the buy? (Hearts of Stone, Blood and Wine) Yes, very much, for a DLC they offer so much content for the price.\n\nSoundtrack: Not much can be said here, it's freakin GOOOD.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCons: \n\nYou have to give up on your life to fully experience it all.\n\n\nThe game eventually ends.\n\n\nOverall: A very good RPG.

That being said, you can take my review with however large a grain of salt you may wish. \n\nTo say the game is vast belies the true scope. The designers wisely guide you from quest to quest in a flowing, natural way, almost always part of the story. Note that I said \"guide\". There is rarely any pressure or situations that lockstep you into a given path. You are free to make choices that let you go as deep down the rabbit-hole as you wish to go....\n\n            ...and that hole is very deep indeed.\n\n\"Story rich\" is a term that has a nice, general sort of meaning to it, but again, does not do the efforts of CDPR proper justice. The game is so tightly wound into the books, that unless you have read them, you constantly miss the references that are so beautifully woven into the tale. If you have not read the books, you don't lose anything, but you definitely gain so much more for the knowledge.\n\nThe story, while deep and inviting, is marred a bit by the development of some of the characters. There are some that have a constant impact in the game, but the characters themselves feel somewhat shallow and undeveloped. Yennefer, for example: The character of the books is haughty, proud, complex, and passionate. The game character feels just b*t**y and moody.  Some of them, however, are just delightful and give you real reason to \"buy in\" to them (Zoltan and Dandelion come immediately to mind).\n\nThe environment - I am somewhat of two minds about the environment. Aspects of it are epic...the vistas from on high can be breathtaking. The play of light through trees and the colors at sunrise and sunset are a visual feast. There is a great deal to lend itself to the suspension of disbelief that is critical for immersion into the game world. But there are some things that blow that disbelief up quicker than a grapeshot bomb.  The trees, bushes and grasses look very obviously two-dimensional. It was a disappointment that was lessoned somwhat by the variety in the landscapes, and the impact of weather on it, but it still was a bit of a jarring surprise when taken in context with the overall quality of the environment. Then there are the many inconsistencies in the way Geralt interacts with his environment (swimming on land, the inability to use terrain to your advantage in combat, getting stuck in trees, etc.). \n\nCombat is by far the best iteration of all the games in the trilogy. It still remains a bit clunky (having to go into inventory, then go to your potions/food/bombs tab, then select the bombs you want to use, then exit out of all that, to have to go into the wheel and select the bomb before you throw it.....is a real pain in the @$$..... would have made far more sense to allow the user to simply click on the bomb slot in the power wheel and get a pop up inventory of just bombs. Same for potions slots and special slots.)  But beyond those inconveniences, the blend of signs and attacks, coupled with dodging, parries, and combat rolls makes for an engaging, flowing combat experience. Some fights are simply acrobatic melees, while others require careful patience, waiting for the right time to strike, while maintaining a stout defense to avoid getting one-shotted.\n\nNow, all this having been said, I have to admit that I was more than a bit disappointed that CDPR fell into the same trap of American publishers: putting the game out before all the bugs were ironed out. There have already been 8 patches and still there remains a plethora of irritating bugs (inability to talk to certain npc's that you should be able to talk to without meditating for an hour first or the flank speed on boats not working are the two most immediate that leap to mind)\n\nYes, there are pros.\nYes there are cons. \n\nBut even with the cons, I would easily match this to The Mass Effect Trilogy, or the Dragon Age trilogy, as one of the most enjoyable RPG experiences I've ever had in gaming. I've already played the game 3 times, back to back, and working on a 4th with the new Game + (which really is the exact same game with everything made higher level....I've not yet seen a benefit to this yet).\n\nWatching Geralt's beard grow as time goes by was just a huge giggle for me. It was a neat touch. Watching whales in the ocean broach by my boat as I sailed by gave me no end of delight. I parked Geralt on a mountain top in Skellige and watched an entire sunset.  I checked myself into Gwent Addicts Anonymous.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Without a breath of hesitation. Then I would immediately advise to take the bugs with a grain of salt, and get lost in this rather amazing world, and thoroughly enjoyable story.\n\nGo, and see just how deep that rabbit hole is.", "timestamp_created": 1441948473, "timestamp_updated": 1441948473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 229, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.878343164920806885", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35875210": {"recommendationid": "35875210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032555860", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 31203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1530884494}, "language": "english", "review": "Only buy this game if you want to ruin every other RPG you play from here on out.", "timestamp_created": 1508538435, "timestamp_updated": 1508538435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 264, "votes_funny": 56, "weighted_vote_score": "0.883263468742370605", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39979158": {"recommendationid": "39979158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097338086", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1521261187}, "language": "english", "review": "I completed the cracked version 2 years ago.

You can decide anything, both minor and major things. All characters in game have their own story which is really awesome.              Velen is a land that suffered war and gives you that real authentic touch of how medieval land looks like just like Novigrad which is just how one middle-age city looked like.                     Graphics are beautiful and honestly I haven't seen a RPG like it.  After that you have epic side quests with amazing lore and seriously huge map to explore. By huge I mean the biggest map for 1 higly complexed video game in history.\n \nThen, when I entered the Skellige its like I entered another world.The authentic Irish accent made it look like whole another universe which this game truly is. During game you have several romance options and you choose a girl which you will end up with which is something seirously amazing for a video game. Not to mention all those sex scenes.             \nTo complete main storyline alone it takes around 50 hours while ending depends on you and your choices troughout whole game. \n\nThe soundtracks in this game are literally THE BEST. They are mostly made of polish folk music but there are also some Serbian such as \"Oj Lazare\" which are some of the best slavic musics. The only con in this game was that in free roam I didn't have the option to talk to the main characters but that was fixed in latest expansion which I really appreciate CDPR for, as I and many other customers requested it.                        \n\nI won't be describing DLC's as this review should be dedicated to the base game.

The game sucks you in and takes you for a ride that's filled with all kinds of diversions, but never gets too overwhelming.\n\nThe writing and quest design is very good. Hardly any side quest or contract is a simple fetch quest. All have something unique about them. The main quest and its 'spin-off' side quests are what makes the game really amazing though. If you've played the first two games (and/or read the books) you'll meet a lot of characters again. There's so much to do and you always have a choice (that matters) how to tackle the tasks. \n\nGeralt's world is interesting and while one of the areas you'll play in (the biggest one) feels a bit too dark and bleak (which makes sense given the current situation there), the rest of the areas is just gorgeous. Especially Toussaint from the Blood and Wine DLC is just beautiful.\n\nThe graphics and the animations are great. You can see emotions on faces and when you see your first drunk stumbling through Novigrad, you'll wonder why other games don't put that much detail into their game world. The dawn and dusk lighting effects add a lot of atmosphere to the game. Same goes for the sound effects and the music in the game. Just an example of the music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWbE5sgL8bc\nThere are a few nit-pick problems that are far from being important, but at times they can get a bit annoying. For one enemies with a shield are weirdly overpowered. You can use your signs to break through their defense and try to roll behind them, but the way they block every hit from the front can get irritating. Another small issue is the movement control when using mouse and keyboard. Quite often you have to examine exact spots on the floor and using the keyboard to position Geralt can be tedious. Using an analogue joypad it's a lot easier to do it. The last complain is the UI. I understand that there's a lot of elements that had to be included and the tutorial is very good, but still I found the UI to be a bit overburdened and not very intuitive to use.\n\nOverall this game is really a masterpiece that will not only entertain RPG fans a lot.

Full Price even. Then buy the books and the other games. Hitchhike to Poland to pick up a copy if you have to.[/h1]\n\nMy wife and I made it a habit to play the  witcher 3 together instead of netflixing or similair over the past few months. It took a few tries to get into it and it was a menacing and daunting task at first. We went into the game totally blind, not knowing anything of the books or the games that came before.\n\n[i]Here I sit, having finished the main storyline and most of the side content (took us 120 hrs.), writing a game review. Something I hardly ever do.\nAs i write this, there is some dreadful feeling of emtpiness inside me and that's because of two reasons.[/i]\n\nFirstly because over the last few months this was our ritual. Firing up the game, slaying monsters, conversing with peasants and kings alike, laughing, crying and worrying about the situations we found ourselves in. We were genuinely immersed in the struggles of characters big and small, well written and relatable. In the end we sat there, watching the credits. Reflecting on our journey. Seeing Geralt and pals off with the same bittersweet feeling you get when you finish that one book or watch the last episode of your favourite show. You know it's over. Those people you grew attached to, you have to \"let them go\" in a way. At least we still have the DLCs and the older games to look forward to.\n\nSecondly because I knew it could only go downhill from here. I showed my wife \"teh best gaem evarr made\". Any other game we will play together after the Witcher 3 will be \"it's good, except for XY\". You will not find a more complete package. A game that has a story this gripping with good looking, yet well performing graphics and a core gameplay loop as fullfilling. No soundtrack as fitting, no scenery as convincing, no character models as appealing to look at (or appalling, given the need), no world as believeable. CD Projekt Red have put an insane amount of polish (no pun intended) into every bit of this game, no matter how small and insignificant it may have seemed at the time. And you can tell.\n\nTo name a few outstanding occurances that made me go \"gold star, you Polish guys\":\n[list]\n[*]You can start a quest \"sideways\" by discovering something accidently you might have not known about yet. The game still finds a way to get you to complete that quest in a way that doesn't feel like its just leading you by the nose. At any point in any quest there is always a logical, understandable and very relatable reason why you're walking from X to Y, doing Z.\n[*]We had the chance to visit a character later in the game and take our revenge. We however had already killed said character before. When Geralt said \"sure, lets pay that guy a visit\", we finally thought we had found a way to break the game with its countless branching story paths. We didn't. Without trying to spoil to much, the game went \"did you not pay attention? This character is in the story as well\" and we sat there, mouth agape, mesmerized by the fact that the storywriters kept this in mind, just in case someone tries to be funny.\n[*]Your choices truly matter. Most of the time, however, not immediately. Morality, Ethics and the question of good and evil have always been the strong suit of the Witcher universe. Something you thought heroic now will come to bite you later. Worse, it usually doesn't come to bite YOU but the characters you grew attached to. The tension in the cutscenes is real because you're never sure you did the \"right\" thing at some point before. Once we were done with the game we checked the Wiki page and saw what could happened in our playthrough... boy oh boy, we got lucky...\n[*]Some peasant tried to talk shit to Geralt. We drew our sword. Said peasant tried not to talk shit anymore.[/list]\n\nNot that I wish to say this game is perfect.[list]\n[*]A few glitches and bugs occured, but never to such a point that it broke the game. Think of it as little amusing eastereggs maybe.\n[*]All the possibilites, side content, potions and blueprints can be overwhelming at first. Especially in the beginning the game has the very bad habit of popping up ten tutorial textboxes once you pick up a leaf. It really takes some time getting into the game and mechanics, but once you do it grips you.\n[*]The combat, although easily the best of the series, can be irritating sometimes. Animations tend to have this long (as in frantic-combat-I'm-trying-to-dodge-this-lightning-bolt-long) blending period in which you might get stunlocked or Geralt flat out refuses to acknowledge your button inputs (looking at you, fistfighting right after parrying). The camera, both locked on and not can also be dodgy sometimes. I imagine once I replay this on a harder difficulty it will be responsible for the occasional teeth grind. Maybe it's better with mouse and keyboard, I couldn't tell as we played on controller.[/list]\n\nTo finish of this [strike]boo[/strike], review:\nGet this game. Even if you don't like RPGs. Even if you don't really care about video games too much. CD Projekt Red deserves your money. They are the antithesis to EA, Activision and comparable companies that put money first and everything second.

[/b]\n\n[b]Storyline - 10/10 [/b]\nStory is presented in a very nice form. In most of the dialogue you can choose what to say. We have many ways to pass the mission. We can do it quietly or killing everyone. Each mission is interesting and different than earlier. The story is for 30h game without sidequests. We also have mini games like cards (Gwent).\n\n[b]Gameplay - 9/10 [/b]\nBeautiful world giving many opportunities for the player. We can explore caves, forests, mountains, helping peoples and doing much more things. The map is 30 times bigger than in the previous part. Crafting and Alchemy are more important, we also can upgrade swords, armors and signs. These sandbox gives many, many opportunities. Fight feeling is pleasant. Sometimes we are blocking on a small obstacle but in comparison to other games it is not very annoying.\n\n[b]Characters - 10/10 [/b]\nEach character has its own charm. Characters are well matched to the storyline and to the environment. We can decide who will be our enemy and who is our friend. We also can choose the path of the main character. Character (mainly Geralt's) and monsters doing really great feeling, details are amazing.\n\n[b]Graphics - 10/10 [/b]\nGraphics in this game is amazing. Even the smallest details are well refined, for example when we move the grass moves with us. Graphics capabilities used in 100%. The movement of water clouds are very well refined, falling leaves, changing weather make a huge impression.\n\n[b]Sounds - 10/10 [/b]\nMusic and ambient sounds in this game is great fits. We can listen medieval music which is selected for each moment of the game. Animals noises are natural. The monsters sounds are really threatening. Character voices are well selected and fit into personalities.\n\n[b]Overall - 10/10 [/b]\nIf you are thinking about purchase this game, if you like open world and action RPG games, I would recommend these game for you, and I guarantee a lot of fun comes from that game.

Dismemberment and executions while in combat.\n-Voiceacting is well done and is very immersive.\n-Plenty of opportunity to explore the cities, villages, dungeons, castles, enchanted forests, caves, valleys and so forth.\n-Brilliant storyline focused on the protagonist Geralt of Rivia, and his quest to find and protect the powerful \"child of the elderblood\", Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (Ciri).

Almost large portion of the game storyline came from its cutscenes, it's unfortunate for those who want to take a phone call, had to pee, or any other multitasking, etc. You will misssed some of its story content\n\nOverall I recommend this game\n9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1535885635, "timestamp_updated": 1542803170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 117, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.833317279815673828", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43899530": {"recommendationid": "43899530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065634050", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1531896181}, "language": "english", "review": "---{Gameplay}--- \n\u2611 Try not to get addicted\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Nothing special\n\u2610 Ehh\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Just dont\n\n---{Graphics}---\n\u2611 Masterpiece\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Will do\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Awful\n\u2610 Paint.exe\n\n---{Audio}--- \n\u2611 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Earrape\n\n---{Audience}--- \n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Everyone\n\n---{PC Requirements}--- \n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2611 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Story}--- \n\u2610 Doesnt have (Not counting historical stuff)\n\u2610 Something isnt nothing I guess\n\u2610 Not great\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2611 Will make you cry or smile alot\n\n---{Difficulity}--- \n\u2610 Just press a bunch of buttons\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Significant brain usage \n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Not so easy\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}--- \n\u2611 Nothing\n\u2610 Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isnt necessary to progress\n\u2610 A bit grindy sometimes\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 Insanity\n\n---{Game Time}--- \n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of tea\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2611 Depends on you\n\u2610 Endless\n\n---{Price}--- \n\u2611 Just buy it\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2610 Wait for sale\n\u2610 Maybe if you have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 Dont throw money into a rubbish bin\n\n---{Bugs}--- \n\u2610 Never had any\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Few bugs \n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 Ruining the game\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs", "timestamp_created": 1533248255, "timestamp_updated": 1534091490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 260, "votes_funny": 52, "weighted_vote_score": "0.893577337265014648", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15975007": {"recommendationid": "15975007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008068564", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549870310}, "language": "english", "review": "The amount of content you get for your money is unbelievable.

Excellent visuals and superb voice acting complete the experience for the flagship game of a successful franchise: increasingly polished series, ending with a true masterpiece.\n\nThis game is centered on its main story, and has lots of cutscenes and dialogue. It was designed like an interactive movie with lots of rich, interesting characters and meaningful decisions. Do not expect continuous, mindless combat or a dull, weapon-collecting, inventory-centered experience.\n\n[i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i] is a game to enjoy at ease, taking time to appreciate the environment and to understand the lore. There is so much content and quests that no two gameplays will be the same. You can play for 60 hours, finish the main quest and storyline and still have half the game\u2019s content to see.\n\nThe quests are really detailed and well thought, a far cry from mindless fetch, kill and gather missions that plague so many other games, be them action, RPG or hack and slash. Every quest in [i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i] comes together as a coherent piece of a complex universe, entangled in the politics of war, the difficulties of survival and the grim existence in a morally-ambiguous world.\n\nSeveral decisions made by the player can be game-changing, and you will live to see the consequences of many of your actions, even small and unimportant-looking ones. [i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i] has different endings, depending on what you did and who you chose to help (or not). \n\nKilled characters are gone for good, and most quests will present options that do not exactly adhere to the regular good-or-evil clear-cut paths that most other games take for granted. Not even choosing a lover will be an easy decision for Geralt de Rivia.\n\nThis is a game aimed at adults, with lots of intrigue, corruption, murder, prostitution, racism, exploitation, crime, nudity and sex. The combat animations are gory and brutal, featuring plenty of beheading and dismemberment.\n\nThe sprawling, immersive world was painstakingly created, and it shows. The attention to details is astonishing, be it the texture of an armor, the warpaint of an enemy or the design of a mountain stronghold. The lighting, shadows and water effects make for very beautiful landscapes. The only environmental effect I find not quite to my liking is the propensity for very strong winds, which shake the trees but leave the smoke from chimneys intact, thus breaking the immersion a bit. The music is adequate and sets the right tone. However, there should be more moments of silence every now and then.\n\nThe combat is serviceable and the controls could be somewhat improved, but this is not a specialized action or hack and slash game. The real-time menu for weapons, signs and bombs is quite uncomfortable, and aiming the crossbow is hard with a controller, but the responsiveness of the actions is generally good. Another thing I dislike is Geralt\u2019s weird, jumpy death animation.\n\nThose that want to roleplay should bear in mind that this is not an RPG, but a game with RPG elements. You cannot create or heavily customize characters, apart from clothing and some of Geralt\u2019s skills, and you cannot\u2014and should not\u2014go crazy over DPS stats and numbers. This is no fault or mistake; [i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i] was simply not designed that way.\n\nThe DLCs are some of the best I\u2019ve seen, generously adding to the main experience and providing new story arcs, places characters and equipment. Lots of Free-LC enable even more customizing options. [i]Gwent[/i], the game-within-a-game, is an interesting take on minigames from previous installments of this franchise. Easy to learn, quick to play and with an interesting amount of strategy, will keep most completionists looking for cards right until the very end of the main quest.\n\nWith its few flaws and quirks, [i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i] can still be considered a masterpiece of gaming and a new classic of mixed-genre, bringing together elements of storytelling, RPGs, action and open world games.\n\nOf course, no manmade project can ever be perfect, but you don\u2019t criticize Picasso\u2019s [i]Guernica[/i] or Leonardo\u2019s [i]Gioconda[/i] by focusing only on their glitches and flaws. What makes a classic is both [b]uniqueness worthy of imitation[/b] and the [b]timeless relevance[/b] that will keep the object on sight for generations to come. Both Picasso and Da Vinci achieved that, as well as Mozart, Lloyd Wright, Shakespeare, and yes, [i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i].\n\nFor sure, one of the highlights of modern gaming and among the best games ever created. [i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i] was met with near-universal acclaim, and such reputation is well earned.\n\nUnconditionally recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1543000713, "timestamp_updated": 1543000787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.812192440032958984", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16313782": {"recommendationid": "16313782", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970802230", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 33146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549427125}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know if I can adequately explain why this game is as amazing as I think it is.... but I'll try.\n\n[U][B]The Good[/B][/U]\n\n[B]The writing[/B]\nHands down, this game has some of the best writing I've ever experience in an RPG. The main quest feels very personal, and you actually want to progress in order to find out what happens next. The characters are all interesting and also incredibly well-written. \n\n[B]The quests[/B]\nAgain, this game has the best side quests out of all the RPGs I've played. And that's saying a lot. Every quest seems to have at least some back story. There's typically at least a few forms of interaction other than just killing something and then returning to the quest giver. The decisions you make are never black and white, and usually involve some form of consequences. And FINALLY, you actually get to feel like a real witcher\\monster hunter by taking on some really fun witcher contracts. \n\n[B]The world[/B]\nVelen and Skellige can both rival some of the largest open worlds out there in terms of size, and yet the level of detail and polish remains consistent throughout. Exploration is very rewarding. There's loot to be found everywhere, and little quests can be unlocked along the way to help you find even more treasure. \n\nNovigrad is a HUGE city, and you just walk inside without a hint of a loading screen. It actually feels like a living, breathing world. NPCs have daytime\\nighttime routines, and will seek shelter if it starts to rain. Little things like that go along way to bring you into a world.\n\n[B]Graphics and art design[/B]\nHow can I put this? All things considered, The Witcher 3 is probably the most beautiful game I've ever played. You must experience this game in motion, but [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/jim2point0/sets/72157653074223832]feel free to look through my screenshots if you need convincing.[/url] One thing that can't be seen in screenshots is the way everything moves and feels alive. And while the wind effect might seem overdone, it really helps to sell the atmosphere. \n\nThe Witcher 3 can be rough around the edges and other games are definitely doing some more impressive things technically, but the overall Witcher 3 experience is definitely greater than the sum of its parts. \n\n[B]The combat[/B]\nThis grew on me. At first I didn't like it. I didn't think signs were strong enough, and I was constantly getting my butt kicked. But then I learned how to dodge and counter properly. I learned how to use signs to my advantage, I learned how to stick and move, and start treating each encounter like a puzzle. Eventually I was punching WAY above my weight, taking on level 20 witcher contracts with a level 14 character. Now I love the combat and I'm always looking forward to doing the next Witcher contract.\n\n[U][B]The Bad[/B][/U]\n\n[B]Controls[/B]\nQuite possibly my biggest gripe with the game. Controls just feel clunky at best. I play with a mouse and keyboard, so maybe that is part of the reason... but movement in this game feels sluggish and unresponsive. Sometimes I'll try to move Geralt a little bit and he won't budge, and at other times he'll move too far and run off a cliff. Just turning around can feel like a chore as Geralt has a rather large turning radius. Even worse are the horse controls, which kinda feels like driving around a very large SUV. Constantly getting stuck on geometry and trying to maneuver around it is an ongoing, frustrating chore.\n\n[B]Balance[/B]\nEven on the largest difficulty, it doesn't take long for this game to become a cake walk. IF you enjoy the sidequests like I do, you'll likely spend a lot of time completing them instead of doing the main quest. The main quest is GOOD, but some of the game's best content can be found in the sidequests. And after 20 hours of questing, you'll probably find that the next step in the campaign is 5 levels below you and therefore not challenging in the slightest. There were several instances where I'd go up against an enemy that is supposed to be tough and intimidating... but I kill it in less than 12 seconds.\n\nLoot progression is also a joke if you do any kind of crafting. The witcher gear is probably better than anything the game will give you from monsters or chests. During your travels, you'll come across countless relic quality swords. And they may even have more damage than your current green sword. But witcher gear is highly specialized and usually compliment specific builds. Using a higher damage sword might actually gimp you if you lose a massive bonus to sign intensity, or adrenaline point gain. \n\n[B]Other stuff...[/B]\nThere's still so much I could go into. Replay value is probably lower since you only have 1 character to play as, but the game makes up for that with a much more personal and involved story. Gwent is probably a very fun card game, but I still haven't played a single game due to not wanting to dump a ton of time into it. Some day I will. Witcher sense is fun at first, but after a while it will feel like a chore. Having to hold down the button combined with the ridiculous screen effects really hampers my enjoyment of this commonly used mechanic. And you never feel like you're solving an investigation using witcher sense. Just looking for red stuff on the ground and following on screen prompts while Geralt figures everything out for you. \n\n[U][B]Conclusion[/B][/U]\nI can not possibly cover everything there is to cover about this massive game. But I can say that the good FAR outweighs the bad, and that this is is my favorite open world RPG of all time. I know that The Witcher series isn't for everyone, but I think you owe it to yourself to at least give it a try. \n\nAnd again, if you need convincing that this game is drop-dead gorgeous, have a look through my screenshots :)\n\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/jim2point0/sets/72157653074223832", "timestamp_created": 1434055699, "timestamp_updated": 1434055757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 224, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.908248782157897949", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36382039": {"recommendationid": "36382039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135491453", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 7449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1542834125}, "language": "english", "review": "For a very long time I was thinking about writing a review on The Witcher 3 : Wild hunt...\nI was always asking myself ; Am I good enough to write a review that this game truly deserves?

And this my review so here we go : \nThe Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt continues the story of the legendary witcher Geralt of Rivia , The white wolf , this time in search of cirilla, the witcheress who is the daughter of emperor Emhyr var Emreis...\nThe ability to travel through time and space makes Ciri a dangerous weapon with the potential to destroy the whole world.\nGeralt is informed by Yennefer of Vengerberg (Geralt's lover and a powerful sorceress) that Ciri is being chased by The Wild Hunt, a group of wraithes from another dimension, for not so good intentions.\nSo Geralt goes on a mission to find Ciri before The Wild Hunt does...

Recently I read all the English translated books by Andrzej Sapkowski (a hero and they are highly recommended).\n\nI have already ploughed 80+ hours into this game by doing many exploration, sub and main quests. I am trying to have breaks so I will finish it eventually (unlike Skyrim, where I was Skyrim'd out).\n\nThe monsters, characters and environments stay true to the Witcher world. You can tell the people who made this game really care about this game and its environment. They are providing free DLC, but you can buy a season pass if you want even more Witcher goodness.\n\nThe fighting is fluid and there are horse races, crafting and collectible card games to add even more variety to a great well thought out game. Shame there are no sex cards this time though ;-)\n\nThe graphics look great even on the lowest settings and each quest feels like a proper adventure, not just fetch some feathers or kill ten wolves because they look scary. You actually feel like you are making a difference to the world around you, liberating towns and developing relationships.\n\nThis is one of the best games I have played. I won't say game of the year just yet, but it is clearly going to be in the top five!", "timestamp_created": 1436907553, "timestamp_updated": 1436907553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 328, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.905909240245819092", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 9, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "total_positive": 72106, "total_negative": 2152, "total_reviews": 74258}}
