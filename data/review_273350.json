It's simultaneously one of the most precisely balanced, and yet generally imbalanced games I've ever played, with a meta that's stagnated heavily from 2 years of non-development. Some days it brings me great joy, and other days it gives me immense rage. Despite that, my opinion of the game is largely positive, even if some days are worse than others.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a true TLDR: Evolve is a heavily underappreciated game with great tactical, moment to moment combat decisions, a fantastic atmosphere & backstory, and a unique variety of epic monsters and flushed-out hunters, but held back by a low player base, exceptionally long wait times, imbalances on all sides of the field, an immensely punishing learning curve, and a generally toxic veteran community.\n\nStage 1 (or Legacy) Evolve feels like a distant memory to me. In general, Stage 1 had a deeper plot line, richer atmosphere, and overall more soul than Stage 2. However, Stage 1 was also clunkier, slower, more punishing, and more RNG dependent than Stage 2; the latter two aren't necessarily deal breakers, but also didn't help alleviate the immense learning curve for new players. The environments and wildlife were more dense & flushed out, as well as more dangerous for both sides of the field, but also harder to navigate and again occasionally imbalanced by RNG. And while not all monsters/hunters were meant to be created equally, some just straight up lost their identify with rebalances, and became odd mishmashes of abilities that didn't synergize with each other.  But what people tend to focus on the most was the perceived \"pay to win\" system. The first 3 tiers of hunters & monsters could be unlocked over time, but cosmetics and later hunter/monster generations couldn't. And while the newer hunters/monsters weren't necessarily more overpowered than their predecessors, not having a diversified character pool left players at a distinct disadvantage to those who did. \n\nStage 2 is the gamemode I've played the most, and have the most feel for overall. Stage 2 was supposed to be the start of the redemption arc, where they re-polished maps to make them easier to navigate, and while this usually meant reducing the foliage/wildlife & subsequently a bit of the original soul, it did help bring some much needed clarity and stability to game. Monsters/hunters could also be unlocked via ingame currency, and although most would take around 10+ hours each to unlock under optimal circumstances, it was still a step in the right direction. Character levels were also reworked, and actually meant something now that they couldn't be grinding out against bots in an hour or two, and perks were overhauled so that you could mix and match different bonuses, instead of choosing just one super-powered one like in Stage 1. But the thing I liked most was that developer updates were now a weekly occurrence, instead of a \"once in a blue moon\" kind of event; a big step in the right direction, even if it came too late. \n\nI think the thing that makes me the saddest is the state the game was left in when the developers pulled the plug. There were blatant flaws and imbalances that were still being looked at when development stopped. As mentioned before, the learning curve was still immense for both sides, but a bit more for hunters in particular, since they had to rely heavily on their teammates for support. However, the average player didn't have a full party of experienced hunters to play with, so parties were more often than not these weird mish-mashes of hunters that didn't have any synergy to them, wouldn't have the perks to properly support them, and were often the weekly free-to-play hunters that required an advanced understanding of the game to function. It also didn't help that, while tutorials existed for each tier of hunter, only the assault was given out for free in the end, instead of one for each class. Hunts could still easily be 15 minute \"flee till 3\" matches, because despite the reduced gameplay timers and attempts to quicken matches, the updated perk systems meant that monsters had many more traversal options available to them than before. And it only took one weak link on your team to lose a match, especially if said person is the medic or assault. \n\nOn the flip side though, monsters had a big advantage when facing normal teams, but were colossally difficult to play versus premades. In general, a monster could choose a mixed set of mobility & combat perks, and preform well versus non-premades. But premade hunter teams tended to focus around defensive-heavy or mobility-heavy comps, augmented by perks that had no direct counters, which the mixed sets couldn't handle. This often lead to situations where most monsters had no way of escaping a sustained chase from mobility teams, or just couldn't reasonably out-damage the healing of heavily defensive comps (to the point of needing to land every single ability for 60 seconds straight, in order to down a single hunter). Some characters, both for hunters and monsters, were much too powerful for their own good, and could often lead to cases where they invalidated others. Not having any access to character bans, or ways to hard counter the more overpowered perks, didn't help the situation either, and in a game that prided itself on the \"50/50\" win rates, the impossible situations this game would sometimes put you in didn't help much in sustaining it's dwindling population.\n\nAnd yet, despite the imbalances, I still had a lot of fun with this game. I loved playing as the monsters, using wits to lure teams into good fighting spots, learning how to cycle abilities properly, or figuring out the best perk systems for each monster, which I continued experimenting with despite 2 years of meta stagnation. I loved all the monsters and their unique ability sets, even if some weren't that good. And while I freely admit that I'm by no means a great hunter, I will say that it was kind of refreshing playing the game from the opposite side of the field. Evolve was meant to be played with friends, and indeed my best experiences as hunter were in premade groups. I liked playing with newer and mid-tier hunters, who were usually quite nice and willing to try out new combinations of hunters & perks. Teaching newer players was immensely fulfilling, and I liked explaining some of the deeper lore from the forums. What bothered me the most though were the veteran players, who over time tended to become more intolerant, less willing to cooperate/compromise, and more toxic towards others, both from wins and losses. Because of the extremely small community, a lot of players just ended up being boycotted by others, a big reason why veteran hunters almost exclusively stuck with each other. Perhaps this is just the fate of all multiplayer games, I don't know. Luckily, it was only a small blip compared to the rest of the game. \n\nEvolve was flawed, but I still think it was a very worthwhile game to play. Even with more than a few bad experiences, no other game series has drawn me in, nor captured my imagination, as much as this one has. I'm sad that Evolve suffered a slow, steady death, and that we'll never get the full potential of what this game could have, and should have, been. But nothing was meant to last forever, and I'm both honored and privileged to have played as much as I could. \n\nThank you, old friend.

The chasing, the comps, the monsters etc. Players were generally nice, many people helped others out and much more. After the disaster that was Legacy Evolve, the consistent updates were a huge blessing from TRS. They came out with new characters, new monster adapation, refactored some of the old monsters, and the PLANS this game had coming into it, man I was excited! TRS was ACTUALLY doing something to improve the game and the updates were AWESOME!\n\nThen came the news above. TRS was fired from the game by 2K because they felt it was a waste of time.

The game was released earlier this year, post a very productive alpha and beta. However, shortly thereafter, you may have heard of the DLC uproars and consistent bugs/glitches/fails that plagued the retail version for a very long time prior to any patches. Due to development focusing on the production cycle, the fixes were set in parallel to what developer provided the console version. Therefore, realize this that some bugs still exist (talking about the stupid cursor bug that happens once in awhile, and a few others) due to a delayed patch cycle. Even with patches, many things seem to be a \"1 step forward, 3 step backwards\" type of deal. That is, due to the rapid push-out of DLC, the game has continued to experience new problems most patches, or just pure errors that again take time to fix. \n\nProduct/DLC release cycle: \n\nI'll be short and sweet with this. The DLC release for the game, many find exploitive and attrocious. As for my opinion, I am fine with the DLC, but as of late, it has become a disappointment. In the beginning, the DLC was standalone; most of the DLC was cosmetic as skins for weapons, character or class specific and what not. The skins themselves were weapons only, meaning the overall design of the characters would not be altered in any form besides weapons or color schemes, but this has changed with the release of the Meteor Goliath. \n\nUpon release of new characters, monsters were sold individually and so were hunters (this individual sale was where the problem resided). After a community uproar, the sale policy was changed and those tier 4 characters were provided via Season Pass 1. Same to the tier 5 characters with the introduction of the Season Pass 2, yet it did take time to change to this bulk buy concept. To TRS' (Turtle Rock Studios) defense, this was their first AAA title and IP, so it was still a learning experience, but the overall monetization efforts between them as well as the publisher My2k was a big failure. \n\nGameplay and Mechanics:\n\nYet, the most upsetting part was despite the awesome content, the combination of new content and a fledging company resulted in terrible balance issues between hunters and monsters, even character specific. These problems still persist and despite the outcry, these problems will continue. The issue resides in the process of balancing where character trials are done by Pros and ESL Teams (keyword being TEAMS), meaning minor balance adjustments pros suggest catastrophically impact the overall public player base due the unreliability of solo matchmaking and metagame mechanics of tracking/hunting/team-composition. \n\nTo put it in lamens terms, the pro teams that provide feedback for character debuffs/nerfs or buffs run in teams far more efficient than anything you will encounter in public matchmaking. Therefore, if someone picks something out of the recommended team composition or perks, the entire team suffers as random teams cannot perform to the level of pros or regular teams which consist of friends willing to communicate. Some ways this misrepresentation has ruined gameplay/mechanics stems into monster health/survivability and just simple things like how ineffective the hunter jetpack has become as of late. This misrepresentation results in the whole community debates of \"Monsters too OP, or Hunters too OP.\" This disproportionate representation inevitably leads to similar issues of player base segmentation due to skill gaps as described in the following category.\n\nCommunity and Matchmaking:\n\nFinally, the last category many will be most interested in as this is still an area of concern and all else aside, my main reason to recommend not buying the game. The community has risen and fallen multiple times since the game's release (which has been about half a year almost at the time of review). At the moment, the community has fallen under the 300 Steam mark, meaning you cannot view players online in game anymore since the number is so low. This inevitably leads to horrible teamplay as skill levels differ so much. Even more so, the new Matchmaking 2.0 makes the traditional Hunt mode to be a catastrophic failure as the skill segmentation is done poorly due to the inbalance between players. You may have experienced some form or another of said reasons in the free-to-play weekend, but these problems will persist post-weekend as the player base again levels out. \n\nMore so, the overall community is inaccurately respresented in many forms. The subreddit for evolve may have more members posting than those playing at a time, along with the game developers continuing to favor the input of pros to continue this infant dream of competitive gameplay. I say infant due to the overarching problem of a small player base negatively impacting any efforts to improve competitive matchmaking.\n\nIf unknown, Matchmaking 2.0 is an effort by TRS to promote competitive ranked play. Prior to MM 2.0, players could play the traditional Hunt mode without any penalty of leaving prior to match completion without penalties in the form of reduced Character rank or timeouts. MM 2.0 has shifted the traditional form into only ranked play, meaning the original Hunt mode was removed for this competive copy and there is no way to enjoy the original Hunt form outside of running a Evacuation gameplay (Evac being the 5 day campaign, either PVP or PVE, being 4v1 or 4vCP) or custom match with friends.\n\nSummary:\n\nTo sum up my overall decision, with the reasons above and with foreshadowing as the game development is plateauing out due to the final push for DLC coming out soon in the form of the remaining Tier 5 characters, it is a good idea to avoid the game, at least until it is within the $20 - $30 mark. However, by that time, I assume the game's player base would have fallen even further, so its best to avoid purchasing the game. \n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\n\nEdit Sept. 5, 2015:\n\nMy Playhours Justified:\n\nHad this as a comment to address my play hours, but people skipped it, so here's my justification for play hours.\n\nTo those mentioning my play hours, realize my review is based off of the time since the beginning to now, post all that development. To be frank, as many others have mentioned it in other reviews, the game was extremely promising in the beginning being visually and mechanically fresh, so let's say ~250 of those hours were within the first 3 months of game release. By that time, many DLC and patches came out coupled with balancing issues where my play time dropped drastically as the appeal to the game fell. \n\nSince then, the only real reason I do play, or continue to do so is due to my own friends playing it far more intensively than I am. I became a part of a team, and was the dedicated medic for most matches, so I can't necessarily leave friends hanging, as playing without a dedicated team is tough. However, recent changes are making that seem like a viable solution rather than continuing as my recent \"hours played in the last 2 weeks show.\" I only say this as many can understand, playing a game to only experience frustration or ending on a sour mood post play is not appealing in any way.\n\nThanks again for reading!", "timestamp_created": 1441149577, "timestamp_updated": 1441481781, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1861, "votes_funny": 84, "weighted_vote_score": "0.889105260372161865", "comment_count": 68, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21659257": {"recommendationid": "21659257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123234058", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 46080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479876266}, "language": "english", "review": "My dear Evolve, it's time we go our separate ways...\n\nI tried to make it work, you know I did.\nI dedicated a lot of time just for us.\nTime that maybe I should've dedicated to my wife.\nI mean...

Had a lot of bugs initially, some balance issues, but I was having so much fun in the game even being demolished by the monster was really fun tbh. I started playing more and more, until I like to think I was quite good at the game. Played Hank mostly of course. \n\nThere were bugs, there was some debate on dlc and skins, but frankly the game was so much fun for me that I played it regardless. Recently, I'm not that annoyed they made a game I paid 60 bucks for free to play. In fact, I was excited that there would be more players online. \n\nGame was fresh, looked amazing, but most importantly it had lots of butt clenching moments that kept the game interesting. \n\nThose tense moments, for me at least, often happened when I was stealthed, either playing monster or support, or lazarus. \n\nWhy I don't like Stage 2-\n\nGetting rid of stealth(for the most part) by adding the global BS revealing ability for the hunters as well as getting rid of most stealth for hunters, ruined the fun for me on the hunter and monster side. I understand stealth was frustrating to new players, that they felt like they were just wandering in circles until the stage 3 monster finally showed up and demolished them, but frankly thats because they don't understand proper teamwork and positioning in Evolve. \n\nMaking the game more braindead and less frustrating to bad players might make the game fun for new players, but at least for myself it ruined the gameplay significantly. \n\nSome fun things that would happen with old stealth mechanics that are impossible now:\n-working with your trapper, if you know where the monster is and its close enough, you could stealth the trapper, and fly in together and surprise dome the monster. \n-about to die, pop stealth, try and not use your jetpack(monster can see flare while youre using it), and very, very, carefully walk around the monster as he is swinging around trying to find you. \n-medic is about to die, swoop in, stealth, and try and stay next to them while the monster frantically searches for you both.\n-entire team dies, you stealth and try to get away and survive for however longwhile the monster is trying to find you.\n\nOn the monster side, in general, monsters find it less worthwhile to be as stealthy and ambush hunters. \n\nAlso, trapper as a class is lacking now as anyone can dome. \n\nOverall, getting rid of stealth abilities and adding the global scan made the game more stale, less tense, more braindead in my opinion.  \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1500000322, "timestamp_updated": 1500000322, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 83, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.829893946647644043", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48373760": {"recommendationid": "48373760", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065516815", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1531540282}, "language": "english", "review": "Before a review can be given of this game, I must first give background and review the parent game, as this is a reboot/rework as a desperate last breath from the original game.\nThe original game had tons of potential, and I had some great matches on it, however it suffered and eventually failed on multiple fronts. Already at the game's launch, the game got little exposure despite its unique concept and gameplay feel. I saw it get a passing interview in a gameinformer magazine several months before launch and that was it. Then when the game launched, it contained very few options to mix up gameplay. All gamemodes besides hunt were frustrating, unbalanced, or just boring compared to the default hunt. Then you only had a small number of maps and 2 sets of hunters and monsters by launch, neither of which appealed to the monster and hunter style I wanted. This was personally fixed for me with the wraith update as I loved the wraith, but this was the only improvement made and was the beginning of the end. All sets of monsters and hunters from that point forward were paid DLC only. This greatly accelerated the death of the game, as in adition to favorable balance issues toward DLC buyers, the new content that is needed to keep the flame of a game alive (like nearly all long running games out there) was being restricted to the few users who couldn't smell the end and had more money to spare. In the end the game died do to neglect from the start, and being starved to near death from lack of content.\nApparently the creators weren't done trying however. When I heard this version was a free reboot, I hopped on it, hoping to get a taste of some of the good times I had on the original. What I came to was a worse train wreck than what the original became. In attempting to fix a number of balance issues that the original had as well as allow players to be able to access previously DLC characters, they created many more new problems that resulted in a bastardised product that no longer had many of the mechanics that led to many of the rushes of enjoyment and fear that occured in the original. The Trapper's abilities became reduntant no matter who you were due to a universal 'monster radar' that made all stealth playstyles automatic failures by having a really short cooldown. The dome could only be dropped on the monster when prompted, and any team member could drop it. I realize that this was done to counter bad/troll trappers who would previously waste the dome, however not knowing if you actually managed to trap the monster before it got away and relying on your trapper to do his thing added alot to the thrill of the hunt. Knowing when to drop the dome also used to be important as having the dome up could actually become a bad thing as you couldn't escape the monster, but now that the monster can take down just one of any person and the dome practically drops on its own, the thrill and struggle of trying to keep the monster from singling out the trapper is gone. While there's more that I could go into that they changed for the worse, the end result was that hunters would dominate low and medium skill players as well as players trying out new things, while monster mains could dominate the hunters with just one or two monsters (typically the Behemoth and Elder Kraken).\n\nI cannot recommend this game to anyone anymore. In another life, it could've been big, and the early game reviews like that of IGN agree with me. However due to repeated, unattended or mismanaged mistakes in all nearly all areas of the game (besides visual and audio asthetic which I truely give props to), the game is now a disaster.\nAs for a message to Turtle Rock Studios, if you truely learned from your mistakes or decided to sell the rights/idea to another company, you or they could really make something great. Something that would be remembered as a top game of that year. If you don't believe that, just listen to the reviews. Nearly everyone here who played both games loved the moments they could find and they still believe that this game/series could become great. We haven't given up hope on the idea, just this child of it. Learn from your mistakes. Make more content for the game. Don't exclusivise it, or at least not to a point that noticably affects gameplay. Better balance characters and monsters, even if you have to rework them. Improve server times and matching.

Scroll to the bottom for more\nSo you shouldn't buy any microtransactions. But you should play this game.\n\nEvolve is a 4v1 teambased shooter, somewhat like Dead by Daylight, but at the same time really nothing like it\n\nThe graphical quality is terrific, environments and character designs are beautiful, the monsters are distinctive and beautiful in their own primal way. The maps are technically arenas for fighting in, but they are vast and open, generally lush jungles, basalt pillars, toxic swamps, lava flows, and dotted among them, various high tech structures from abandoned colonies\n The audio design is brilliant, as is the voice acting. Some of the sound effects are just really great, i never get tired of hearing markov prime those arc mines. It's rare that a single sound efffect will be so great as to be worth mentioning, but that one is.\n\nThe gameworld has some interesting lore, told in small snippets of conversation between the characters during mission prep, or in their biographies. You have to work to piece it together, but this is a fascinating grimdark scifi universe, with some pretty neat original ideas.\n\nBut the meat of things, gameplay:\nThe purpose of the game is essentially combat. The hunters want to kill the monster, the monster wants to feed first, and then either kill the hunters or break a generator.\nBefore combat happens theres some interesting cat and mouse gameplay as the monster tries to evade capture while stealthily feeding, and the hunter players try to figure out where its headed. The monster is faster, but there's four hunters and the map has an edge\n\nOnce combat starts, its about the hunters cooperating to act as one unit, while the monster tries to disrupt their formations and pick off key targets. Four roles:\nAssault deals damage and tanks hits\nMedic heals people and runs away - they get targeted first\nTrapper mainly tracks down the monster during the stealth phase, in battle they do distraction and minor damage\nSupport shields, buffs hunters, debuffs the monster, etc. It's the most varied class\n\nEvery role has a significant number of playable characters to choose from, and they all have different approaches to doing the task they do. There's a trapper with a sniffer dog, there's one that places sonar traps, one with a scouting hawk, etc. The developers have displayed surprising imagination in figuring out tons of different ways for someone to fulfill the broad role template they have, and as a result team composition is a significant factor\n\nCombat is deceptively deep. Lots of advanced strategies involving climbing, kiting rocks, timing abilities carefully, and basic plain old gitting gud. It's not perfectly balanced, but its pretty close. \n\nOverall, playing evolve is an interesting experience that leaves you wanting more. But now we come to the big problem.\n\n----------------------------------------\nEvolve is an abandoned game.\n----------------------------------------\nNot like the crappy early access alphas you see all over steam. No, evolve is a mature, polished, AAA experience. And it's in a fine, very playable state. \nBut ultimately, the developers have officially announced the end of support, it is no longer being updated, and although it has a lively, active and loyal playerbase, it will eventually die when the plug is pulled and the servers shut down. \n\nHow did this happen?\nDespite being a great concept, and executed well into a great game, evolve was a commercial failure right out of the gate, due to a spectacular series of financial mistakes on the part of the publisher, Take Two.  \nIt's failure can best be summed up as: \"Greedy publisher controls the IP\".\n\nI'd suggest googling the failure of Evolve to learn more, but the core mistakes imo were:\n1. Absurdly high upfront price on release.\n2. Microtransaction shop in the game from the start, after you already paid through the nose.\n3. Promised freely available content sold in said shop.\n4. Waiting two years to eventually go Free to Play, long after the world had collectively forgotten about it.\n\nTake Two took a position that if the game is good, people would pay an arm and leg for it. By putting insane financial barriers infront of potential customers, they ensured Evolve was starved of players and alienated their fans. They maintained this stance out of pride for two years while it floundered and failed\n\nThe latter was an attempt at swallowing their pride and finally trying to revive a game that was, at the time, dead. It worked to some degree, but not well enough. Eventually, Take Two decided to proverbially lock the developers out of the office. And by no choice of their own, the developers, Turtle Rock, have had their masterpiece stolen out from under them. Not even to give to another developer, simply to squat on for a while longer until take two pulls the plug.\n\nIt could have been saved at many points. By cutting the price. By removing the microtransaction stuff and giving that content freely to the paying customers. By going F2P early when it became clear to everyone that their business model wasn't working. If Take Two cared, they could easily have saved this game\n\nEvolve stands as a cautionary tale. A lesson to the rest of the game industry on how not to do things. A testament to the fact that no matter how big you are, and no matter the quality of your game, nobody is so high and mighty that they can afford to give the middle finger to their players.\n\nBut the game is free for now. And you can unlock everything without paying a penny. That's how i strongly advise playing. Don't give Take Two a cent, but play this wonderful game while it lasts, and mourn for it when it is gone.\n\n8.7/10\nGreat game, shame about the publisher", "timestamp_created": 1506738859, "timestamp_updated": 1506739218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.805037438869476318", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19849116": {"recommendationid": "19849116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065270688", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 14494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449561807}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright, what can I say about this game that hasn't been mentioned already?\n\nIf you're like me, you ignored all of the negative reviews of this game because the core concept of the gameplay just seemed so irresistibly unique and interesting. If you're like me, and you're willing to ignore ALL OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS OF THIS GAME, just because the potential of the gameplay intrigues you, then let me talk to you a little bit about the gameplay that you may be oogling over right now.\n\n--Simply put: it's not as fun as it may look. It's not very strategic. Very quickly it becomes highly one-dimensional, formulaic, and repetitive. \n\n--There's only one \"balanced\" gameplay mode, and that's HUNT. There is essentially no single-player. \n\n--\"Hunt,\" unless you take it to a competitive level--GETS OLD FAST.\n\n--Want to take your game to a competitive level, and you don't have three other friends IRL who also play the game? GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.\n\n--And, if by some miraculous chance you do manage to find three internet strangers that are also skilled, friendly, and willing to take the game to that competitive level with you, I must ask: HOW LONG IS THAT ONE GAME MODE GOING TO REMAIN FUN FOR YOU? I can tell you from personal experience that even if you do manage to get to that level, IT STILL GETS OLD FAST.\n\nIn a nutshell, that's the breakdown of the GAMEPLAY of Evolve--which is probably the only reason you're eyeing this game right now, after all. Now I'll get into the specifics of the game a bit more:\n______________________\n\n[u]GAMEPLAY[/u]: There's no \"cat and mouse\" strategic warfare going on here--90% of the time you are running as fast as you can toward the monster; and oh, that 10% of the time where you're actually \"hunting\" the monster? You're hunting a wraith, and it's tedious--it's not fun.\n\nWhen you're not running toward the monster, you are battling in a dome. Against a good monster, this will require incredible coordination and positioning between the hunters, which you, as a random solo-queue pubber, WILL NOT HAVE, AND GOOD LUCK FINDING OTHER SKILLED, FRIENDLY PEOPLE TO PLAY WITH. I'll talk about that a bit more later.\n\n[u]DLC[/u]: Just disgusting, disgusting. I'm not even going to talk about this, it's been beaten to death by everyone already, and rightly so. It makes me sick. 2K should be embarrassed. And now that the game has been priced down to $13 or $15 from the $60 I paid at release? F U 2K. That is all I can say. It's a SLAP IN THE FACE TO THOSE WHO PAID THE $60 WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT.\n\n[u]CONTENT[/u]:  There's only one viable game mode. I've talked about this already. It gets old FAST.\n\n[u]\"BALANCE\"[/u]: This issue is notorious for Evolve. Personally, I think that the \"top-down\" method of balancing that TR has instituted is in fact appropriate; balancing is addressed from the perspective of highly skilled players, and that is how it should be.\n\n       The last time TR adjusted balancing based on the perspective of random, solo-queue, no-talent pubbers, we were seeing such atrocious trash as 45 second dome cooldowns, absurdly OP hunter compositions, and a meta-game that WILDLY favored the hunters in competitive play.\n\n       The game is NOW closer to being balanced at higher levels of play, but due to the basic core concepts of the game--which are just not interesting or strategic enough, imo--Evolve will never be truly balanced.\n\n[u]MATCH-MAKING[/u]: Just awful. To me this has been the reason why I've finally had to turn away from this game, as much as I wanted to like it. Hunt 2.0 came far too late, and we need more statistics that determine a player's skill level than just a pathetic W/L rate.\n\n     I've told you in the section above that it's imperative to find friendly, communicative, skilled players to queue with. That is hard, and it takes a lot of time. It took me months to build a friends list of decent players and by that time most of those players were leaving Evolve anyway.\n\n     Personally, I have high standards when it comes to finding players that I enjoy gaming with--maybe it will be easier for you, I'm not sure. But I can't tell you how many players I've queued with that just relentlessly complain about the \"balance\" of the game, rather than taking a long cold look in the mirror and admitting that they are unskilled.\n\n     Stop blaming the balance of the game, accurately assess your own skill level, what you could improve upon, and then find better players to queue with. It's that simple.\n\n\n\nEvolve has been such a colossal waste of potential. Ignore this game at any price--it's more frustration than it's worth. If you buy this game you are letting 2K essentially get away with fraud.\n\nTL;DR: REPETITIVE GAMEPLAY AND LACK OF CONTENT MAKE FOR AN EXPERIENCE THAT IS HARDLY WORTH $10, LET ALONE THE $60 THAT I PAID FOR IT.", "timestamp_created": 1450814172, "timestamp_updated": 1450814395, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 232, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.853582859039306641", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36801386": {"recommendationid": "36801386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304485062", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470323073}, "language": "english", "review": "this is a game of cat and mouse where after enough cheese, the mouse can eat the cat.", "timestamp_created": 1511384293, "timestamp_updated": 1511384293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 47, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750545740127563477", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28279747": {"recommendationid": "28279747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107381182", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 6572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1527826873}, "language": "english", "review": "          Honestly one of the saddest ruinings of potential in gaming history.

Most of people who chose the 'monster' didn't realize that 'hey, I have to be stealthy before I grow', which lead to them making a lot of noise, practically spamming the 'hunters' map with location markers to chase after not to mention all the footprints. But if you had a player who knew what he was doing, he'd be able to literally sneak right past them, having them running around entire map clueless as to where he was. And -that- is what I loved in the game. The thrill of actual hunt, leaving behind fake footprints, leading them into completely wrong directions only to duck and sneak right between them. Eventually evolving, and growing from prey to predator, or even picking them off one at a time if they separated. \n\nAfter Stage 2 all that was stripped. Sure, the 'moster' got boosted and made able to kill entire hunter team in weakest stage of evolution, but all that was there to make it a hunt got stripped. Respawn timers on hunters decreased to practically none, a 'Monster is this way' skill they could just pop at any time with not long enough reuse delay. From a stealthy/hunting game they turned it into a 'RUNRUNRUNRUN WAAAAGH BASHY BASH'. \n\nCould I recommend it? That's hard to tell. I wouldn't recommend the Stage 2 version.

It was designed to take the concepts you find in left 4 dead, I.E teamwork and coordination, to a much greater degree.\n\nIn legacy evolve, you simply HAD to work together, because if you didn't, you would very quickly get backed into a corner by the monster. And you also HAD to pay attention, you didn't have a hud telling you were the enemy was at all times, you didn't have indicators or floating ui elements that told you which way to go. You had the tracks that the monster left, if he left them, but you also had to pay attention to the environment, keep an eye out for the trees that a careless monster would damage on their way through. You also had to listen, for some creatures the monster would kill woudl make a very loud call that could be heard all across the map, indicating through audio where the monster was.\n\nYou had to think on your feet as a hunter, you had to predict where the enemy would go, what his path would be, and then prepare accordingly. My single favorite play in this game as a hunter group, was when we allowed the monster to reach stage 2 and  then lured it, using the medic as bait, to a cave where we had set up a beautiful trap. Once snared, we quickly burned through his armor and coordinated attacks to tear through it's health before it could even reach one of us. The monster managed to take down the support but it didn't matter, because while he was guarding the corpse, we laid into him and finished him off.\n\nThe problem this game had was not it's mechanics or it's gameplay, it was the mindset of the people who played it. People went in thinking it would be just another fps game when it really wasn't. The amount of skill required to successfully play as the hunters was far greater than that of the monster. This is where the balance issue came from, not from the game itself. And it's also what brought about the creation of evolve stage 2, a genuinly ruined form of the game, watered down to the point that the average call of duty player could understand and excel in it.\n\nInstead of treating the game like a cod clone, which is what turtle rock and 2k advertised it as, they should have treated it more like it's spiritual predecessor, left 4 dead. They should have implemented player hosted servers, modding tools, and the like, to allow players to create a habitat for teaching players and helping them learn.\n\nA good example of this is in the game Natural Selection 2, which for those who do not know of it, is an asymetrical team based fps game, with a pretty significant skill curve. That game uses servers with the unique \"rookie\" tag to host players who are new to the game, so that they might learn in an environment alongside other newer players, thereby making it easier for them to develop the skills necessary to properly excel in the game.\n\nOf course as they say, hindsight is twenty twenty, and nobody can change the past. We can debate the what ifs of this game, the paths it could have or should have taken, but in the end, it's too late to change anything. The game is what it is now, and no amount of crying, or ranting, will change that.\n\nAs it is, I am recommending this game to players for a handful of reasons. It is free to play, it is actually quite fun to play, both in stage 2 and in the legacy version of it, which all players are able to access by switching to that version in the beta options of the properties of the game in their library. Everything is unlocked for all players, and the servers are still running. Indeed there are in fact players in the game most hours of the day and weekends.\n\nIt is worth playing, but it could have been a much greater experience. Perhaps if more people learn about this game, and the original release state of it, then maybe we shall see a resurgence of it.", "timestamp_created": 1520208230, "timestamp_updated": 1520208230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.746921241283416748", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45852110": {"recommendationid": "45852110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086306998", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 19737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548246347}, "language": "english", "review": "Evolve really could have been amazing. Could. Still, I had tons of enjoyment early on, and high hopes that I can't even put into words. There were many issues, though - it'd be easy to drop a bad review and leave, that's it. But, I want to consider what the game could have been. Here I leave my final thoughts and a review I feel the game really deserves.\n\nThe good: Personally, this game really just clicked with me. The feeling of running around as such a giant, weighty creature had the biggest satisfaction to it. They captured the feeling of playing a giant monster so well that you felt awesome just landing after leaping a good distance... unless, of course, you were a god damn filthy wraith player. \n\nAll of the hunters had such cool abilities and were so satisfying to play too, and were all critically important. Then, the world building. One had to be at least mildly impressed with the story you pick up through the awesome character interactions before each drop.\n\nThe bad: Where did it go wrong? Awful DLC practices played a role, but... more than that. Balance issues, but maybe not how you'd expect. It was not noob friendly.\nYes, an asymmetric 4 vs. 1 is nigh impossible to balance at both a competitive and casual level. The game was balanced around the high level though, heavily. Bluntly, you did not have fun with this game if you weren't good. Honestly I do hate to sound like that guy - duh, git gud idiot - but that really, truly is the case here. It's evident through all the reviews with 2 or less hours of playtime.\n\nI've seen many complaints of how the jetpack feels terrible, when it wasn't treated as an extension of your jumping capability. For those who understand how to properly jetpack it felt great to avoid stuff. The general consensus of players was that the monster team was too strong, when it was the opposite. At high levels the poor monster player struggled extremely against the power of 4 coordinated minds. \n\nWith the importance of each role to play the incompetence of even a single player would drag down the experience of everyone in the game and put a severe handicap on the human team. Of course it would feel in the monster's favor, because even if you weren't bad yourself all it took was for any of the four on the team to kill your odds of victory. But it wasn't even balanced at the high level either! Monsters couldn't win when everyone in the match was good. So, no top end streaming community or esports to keep bringing in new blood and keep interest up because it's an unbalanced mess, and... no casual playerbase thriving and no players to rise up to the top level (not that it would matter since the game is unbalanced at both ends, somehow). But the problems keep growing, this isn't the end of it.\nThe bad, part 2. - Stage 2: After Stage 2 hit, the game was dumbed down and the quality of every match dropped. The tracker's skillfulness at having to successfully track AND dome the monster was thrown out the window in favor of everyone being able to mindlessly throw down a garanteed dome, all the while the tracker's new ability would direct you straight to the monster, with a coooldown so low it was effectively spammable. \nAll of a sudden, with the game made easier for nooby hunters, the plentiful strategies, pathing and nuance of the monsters simplified into bull rushing. \"I need to full steam ahead and eat everything before I am found because I WILL be found.\" Their intentions were pure, I'm sure, but Stage 2 was the worst thing that could have happened to Evolve. They should have adjusted balance by making monsters stronger for higher level play while making the classes more intuitive for newer and casual players. Instead they didn't do anything for high level gameplay and simultaneously buffed hunters monstrously and also cut out all kind of required strategy and thought from the hunter's side. This wasn't just a bandaid fix, it was like pouring anti-venom into a gunshot wound.\nBut the quality of matches dropped off a cliff and almost always ended in a stage 1 monster fight. With Stage 2 also came the cut of a TON of content. Of the plentiful 19 maps, only 5 were now playable. Game modes were cut and custom settings for private games were a fraction of what they were before. \nThe conclusion:Evolve could have been so much more, and they could have done so many things differently. It had a spark of creativity and when you had the magical matches the worked out it was an incomparable experience. Mismanagement and poor design, development and balance decisions turned a flawed and unique game into just another generic and dead failure of a game amidst a sea of many others. \nSo here I am, left with a game that not only can I not play online, but should I for some reason want to play a custom AI match, I can only do it on 5 maps with none of the awesome settings that there once was.", "timestamp_created": 1542422185, "timestamp_updated": 1542424180, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.69095313549041748", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18126058": {"recommendationid": "18126058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113154544", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 77114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1537529240}, "language": "english", "review": "I would discourage againt buying this game. The game is shifted to a point where new players must play with other bad players to receive a rank.

The downloadable characters are overpowered in order to temp you to buy them but in fact it just ruins the game as it is no longer balanced. \n\nLastly, and perhaps most imperative is the fact that minimal game support is provided to gamers outside their main target markets. Thus gamers such as myself are forced to play with terrible connections.

You either play as the big badass monster or as one of the 4 Hunters, thus creating a 1v4 concept that can really blow your mind. \nThe real question about any game though isn\u2019t how fun the idea is, but rather, how much does the fun last, especially in an Online game such as Evolve. So, let\u2019s talk about some pros and cons for this game to get more into that matter:\n\nThe Pros List:\n1)\tThe premise upon which this game is built is mind-blowing and exciting. Hunters versus Monster thrown into a quite big PvP arena, each side with its own strengths and weaknesses.\n2)\tAmazing graphics and great voice-over suck you into the game straight away, creating a great atmosphere of feeling either the hunted or the hunter.\n3)\tWell thought mechanics for both Monsters and Hunters, requiring smart plays, on both sides, to be able to win.\n4)\t3 Different Monsters (with a 4th coming up) with different playstyles \n5)\t12 Different Hunters (3 for each class) and more coming up, each one unique in his role, than the rest, offering great depth to this game.\n\n\nThe Cons List:\nThe game is far from polished, meaning not only the bugs you\u2019ll encounter still lingering around but also matchmaking and balance issues that end up being really disrupting for the game experience. Let me emphasize a bit on the matchmaking and balance issues though:\n1)\tThe matchmaking of this game sucks: Have you ever wondered how it feels to have a game that asks for your role preferences and then goes and completely ignores them? Well that\u2019s the case with Evolve at the moment. Evolve, asks you to pick your preference in a scale of 5, with 1 being your most preferred role and 5 your least wanted one and guess what, the game doesn\u2019t seem to care at all. You join a game and the role you are given is very so often the last one you wanted to play. \n2)\t80% of the games you join are already started, while you are given the spot of a previous BOT (or AI if you prefer) player, usually without perks(starting buffs you get to choose, when you normally pick a role) and almost always, already in a very bad spot within the game, with your side, losing hard.  If you choose to leave the game, you get 1 minute penalty (which isn\u2019t much on its own) but trust me, it adds up pretty quickly when that happens 5+ games in a row, especially with all the loading screens you get to suffer each time.\n\n3)\tBalance: There are a few issues here considering a few Hunter and Monster characters. Some Hunters being underpowered at this point (or pretty useless I should say) and some other characters being quite better on their specific role, giving you no real options when it comes to choosing what you are going to play. For the Monster side there is one Monster (Wraith) that, as it is now, rules them all. And the problem isn\u2019t whether you win or lose, but whether you can actually have fun, winning or not.  Well, that\u2019s not the case when you play against the Wraith cause usually, the hunt sums up to the same pattern ,15 minutes chasing it, while being impossible to catch as pug hunters, then 2 minutes of it wrecking your team cause it reached Stage 3. Fun?\n\nThe balance issues are known to TRS and are said to be targeted with future balance patches and so. But, time is of the essence here and TRS doesn\u2019t seem to believe so. Almost 2 months since game release but no balance patches yet (just a minor bug fix patch) while they spend their time announcing new maps and skins and characters (but I\u2019ll get to that a bit later), leaving their player base overwhelmingly frustrated (27k players at Launch \u2013 3k players 2 months later).\n\nSo overall balance and MM, are what kill the most out of the fun of this game.  It simply won\u2019t let you enjoy the game as you would like to, due to the game\u2019s incompetence to respect your preference towards role and playstyle choices.\n\nMoney-making games and greed :\n\nThe game is getting 2 free maps at 30 of April (1 month from now) while Xbox players will be getting the content 31 of March, seems fair to me\u2026 Why? Probably cause Microsoft paid some huge money for their console to get priority\u2026\nAlso, while the game\u2019s community dies fast, to the point of no return, what we only see, is more DLC and paid character packs coming out (25$ for 4 new hunter +15$ for a new monster), 2 months after people already paying 50$ to get the base game. That sounds pretty crap to me but I\u2019ll leave that to everyone\u2019s perception and pocket condition.\n\n\nTo wrap things up :\nYes this game can be quite fun, but after a given time of probably 30 hours or so, you find yourself, getting more and more frustrated over issues that shouldn\u2019t even exist in this game to begin with. \nI wouldn\u2019t recommend paying more than 25$ for this game especially when you consider the 40$ you have to pay to get the new content.", "timestamp_created": 1426843046, "timestamp_updated": 1426853039, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 742, "votes_funny": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.848426699638366699", "comment_count": 34, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14413085": {"recommendationid": "14413085", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984410589", "num_games_owned": 1361, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453703406}, "language": "english", "review": "This is how you absolutly do NOT do a launch.

While it can be enjoyed with friends, I honestly cannot recommend this game to the general market, as your experience without pre-made groups will be lacking, disappointing and ultimately a waste of your time.", "timestamp_created": 1496450407, "timestamp_updated": 1496451244, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 159, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.787404894828796387", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42075858": {"recommendationid": "42075858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023243549", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490561520}, "language": "english", "review": "#SaveEvolve", "timestamp_created": 1526527568, "timestamp_updated": 1526527568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667700707912445068", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12729455": {"recommendationid": "12729455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034334512", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474819574}, "language": "english", "review": "+ You can catch the monster in a thunder dome and he can't run away like a coward.\n-You are stuck in the thunder dome with said monster and can't run away like a coward.", "timestamp_created": 1414868495, "timestamp_updated": 1414868495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3044, "votes_funny": 2809, "weighted_vote_score": "0.830455660820007324", "comment_count": 37, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29709036": {"recommendationid": "29709036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086125734", "num_games_owned": 499, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 1593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486775964}, "language": "english", "review": "i wish this game didn't have to die, thats all im going to say\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRIP evovle 2015-2016, it hasn't even got its 2nd birthday and its already dead, fuck 2K for killing a game with so much potienal", "timestamp_created": 1486265096, "timestamp_updated": 1486265096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.741317331790924072", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14411146": {"recommendationid": "14411146", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997727829", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1414913106}, "language": "english", "review": "Not enough content to be worth $80", "timestamp_created": 1423533203, "timestamp_updated": 1423533203, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3210, "votes_funny": 90, "weighted_vote_score": "0.798318028450012207", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14412332": {"recommendationid": "14412332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008362722", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474661112}, "language": "english", "review": "So far I'm really liking this game, the only downside for me is the instability in multiplayer.\nLet me explain this further.\n\nUPDATE: the crashing and dcing stopped since a couple of days, the mouse still dissappears and they're still milking the dlc, I'm still not recommending this game.\n\nWhile you're in the middle of an evacuation or skirmish and absolutely wrecking this monster, the game can suddenly decide to really fuck you over and DC or just instantly crash.\nAnd naturally it doesn't save anything during your extermination so this can be pretty rage inducing.\nAfter an alpha AND beta you'd think they've fixed this buuuuut nope.\nOut of 10 matches I dced/crashed on 6 of them losing all my progress.\n+ the mouse keeps fucking dissappearing...\nIn it's current state I would not recommend it.\n\nAnd no I don't got a crappy internet connection and no I don't got a crappy gaming set-up.\n\nAlso fuck their DLC plans", "timestamp_created": 1423542216, "timestamp_updated": 1423839337, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2329, "votes_funny": 59, "weighted_vote_score": "0.77300184965133667", "comment_count": 18, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15285243": {"recommendationid": "15285243", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989948591", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502072737}, "language": "english", "review": "Not even close to worth what it costs.

No it actually made the game worse.\nIt shoved everyone into a scaling level system which ment at the entry level of the game anyone new like myself who only got back around to the game 2 years later discovered that its fallen into a complete chaotic mess with little to no attempt to balance at all for low level players.\n\nTo put it simply if you have a vet of the game or two on your team you've litteraly already won. From perks taht just constantly reveal the monsters location to traps that all but stun the monster completly that they can lay almost everywhere and the fact that early level monsters get dicked over so hard they cant seem to tell which way's up it generaly ends in the monster nearly getting killed out of the gate as the 10 seconds they have to run litteraly cant save them as harpoons outrange the distance they have available to get away in the 1st 10 seconds and most trappers have so much range you cant escape before a dome is dropped on your head.\n\nAdditionally Evolving as said monsters feels near impossible. in multpile thrity min games I cannot ever escape and litterally always have a hunter walking quite litteraly beside me because I'm a mix of just too slow and honestly too weak. your gated heavily behind a perk system that you Cannot afford and your evolve cost is so high it would require a hilarously huge headstart of easily 20-30 seconds for you to actually be able to get anywhere close to it before they catch you the first time.\n\nAnd then theres the hunterside, while the game is prety generous to hunters theres on issue noted above for them. Monsters are gated behind skillpoints they have to buy. You know who has all of them? Vet monsters and holy shit will you know it. The second you drop off the barge your going to be hit with more damage than you could track and be asking for the liscence plate of the car that just ran you over. While early leveling is excessivly difficult and your perks cost a small fortune for the monster The final perks that are strong are hilarously too strong. leaving the poor hunters feeling like their made of paper (which they basicly are unless they have shields) and their dropped almost instantly leaving them feeling cheated.\n\nall in all as much as I desperatly wish for the game to be good the match making is honestly hot garbage leaving you with no way to actually find a match without either a vet player on hunters which makes playing monster completly impossible for any new player or you get a vet monster in whcih case good luck. they have all the perks they need and will litteraly kill you when you drop from the drop ship.\n\nAll in all the game has a great concept a horrid delivery and is setup so incredibly against new players it sucks the fun out of it.", "timestamp_created": 1490444674, "timestamp_updated": 1490955461, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710102736949920654", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37419424": {"recommendationid": "37419424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103903146", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470529055}, "language": "english", "review": "My Day is ruined every time I accidentally look at this and recall how good it used to be.", "timestamp_created": 1511558670, "timestamp_updated": 1511558670, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 112, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.744965791702270508", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24203974": {"recommendationid": "24203974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024937147", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 16123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549112663}, "language": "english", "review": "Some nice updates with Evolve Stage 2, but pretty dissapointed that they removed other gameplay modes.
