More bugs in this game than almost every other game I've ever played. Some have been in the game for years.  \n- UI. The Interface was recently done to have the same as console, now it's okay for console but on PC it is worse in every way and extremely hard to navigate. Bugs with the UI makes it difficult just to get people in a party to play the game.  \n- Matchmaking. It's gotten better over the years but still far from perfect.  \n  \nThings I really enjoy about the game  \n- Free to play. You do not need to spend a dime to master this game, however the god pack is extremely worth it and best deal you will get with any other game. There is nothing you can do to spend money and give you an advantage over other players.  \n- 3rd person. Feels a lot better for skillshots than games like League of Legends  \n- MYTHOLOGY. The game is based around REAL pantheons and it's really cool to see those gods come to life.  \n  \nIf this game had no bugs it would be one of the best games out there. However it's been buggy since beta and is arguably MORE buggier than beta now. I want to believe it will get better but years later it is not.

Numerous DXDiags were sent. All I got was \"We sent this to our development team\" No 1 on 1 whatsoever.\n\n- Both 32-bit and 64-bit clients take forever to launch. This on a decent system. 4.7 FX8350, 16 GB RAM, both HDD and SSD load at the same speed. My old system had the same issues FX6300 and GTX 450. Had a 512MB Radeon(HD5xxx??) Can't remember. But Both older cards had the same issues. That still persist today. I don't remember which patch started it's sharp decline, but I believe it because after they started working on their 64-bit client.\n\n- Changing the volume will lag both clients\n\n- DX11 hangs if you minimize it\n\n- DX11 glitchy visuals\n\n- DX11 general poor performace/stability\n\n- Even worse performance if you pair 64-bit with DX11.\n\n-(inb4 you tell me to update my drivers)-\n\nI stay up to date on not only GPU, but MOBO and any other system drivers. I read around for any current issues that affect my models. Always prepared to roll-back if required.\n_____________\n\n- Art\n\nThis game looks so good, A lot of the exclusive skins are really nice if you can get them. There is such a healthy variety of things. It's a shame they hide it behind luck. The skins that are available at any time are not appealing at all. Great if you have favor(earnable ingame currency), but never buy them with Gems (premium paid conversion currency).\n\nYou may find some gods are not true to their source. Such as Thanatos, who is supposed to be a benevolent god. In Smite, he is violent. This is a large turn off for me.\n_____________\n\n- Gameplay\n\nI do not care for too many modes. the main Conquest mode I do not play. I mainly stick to the Arena mode for fun.\n\nMode of the Day is a fantastic system. You get to experience the game in often hilarious ways.\n\nGod balance is as bad as any other MOBA.\n\nMany different playstyles to choose from. The kits have a fair bit of uniqueness unlike some other MOBA where every character needs at least 3 dash abilities.\n_____________\n\n- Community\n\nMeh, At least it's not as bad as League's", "timestamp_created": 1549998636, "timestamp_updated": 1550240197, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519424498081207275", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48917813": {"recommendationid": "48917813", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978346734", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 786, "last_played": 1551847397}, "language": "english", "review": "is a good game but im getting problems, everytime i launch the game it takes likes 20mins to open...im tired of thsi shit", "timestamp_created": 1549859436, "timestamp_updated": 1549859436, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.58575892448425293", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48976012": {"recommendationid": "48976012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107285253", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 61799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1328, "last_played": 1551838327}, "language": "english", "review": "Fix all the fucking issues that have been in the game since 2015.\nBasic Gold frame cuts off at the bottom\nLog in issues\nGame instability\nMaking the community that supports you actually feel like you give a shit", "timestamp_created": 1550091597, "timestamp_updated": 1550091597, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532073318958282471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48975238": {"recommendationid": "48975238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260828081", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550482127}, "language": "english", "review": "Planned on moving from console, but the thing won't even let me log in, To hell with it until it gets fixed.", "timestamp_created": 1550088335, "timestamp_updated": 1550088335, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550512373447418213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48842328": {"recommendationid": "48842328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036560953", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 76104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1550911806}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd recommend this game to the majority of gamers that haven't come to terms with top-down team-oriented games such as league of legends, dota 2 etc. Smite focus on characters in third person view and make this a unique experience. \n\nI do however want to ask people to hold off getting their hands on this FTP (free-to-play) game as Hirez still haven't put their shit together with hot-fixes for the login-freeze bugs which might turn off players already from start.", "timestamp_created": 1549618788, "timestamp_updated": 1549618788, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520940661430358887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49216579": {"recommendationid": "49216579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112034662", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 928, "last_played": 1551033695}, "language": "english", "review": "Matchmaking is utter garbage.

Anyways, the reason for my disapproval for smite is the lack of competence from the Hi-Rez customer support. It took 2 weeks and 2 emails to attempt to fix my name which they did not fix and in fact I do not believe they even read either of my emails despite responding presumably not automated the second time; as the first email did not receive a respond and it took the second email to even get a response and that was literally less 30 words. So, with that out of the way I can would like to also state the steady decline the game has had since its release from beta starting with the awful load time from launcher to client (this I suppose is due to \"Georgia\" or whatever that company is that you see when loading in); either way this same company is also with KF2 which takes a unbearable amount of time to load despite having a SSD. Lastly, for a free to play game it is one of the most expensive in relation to other MOBAs which yes, they are just cosmetics and they have to make money but when seemingly all of the funding goes into skins that are far too overpriced apposed to fixing bugs and errors in game or even balancing issues then why bother spending time when Smite has turned into nothing more than a cash-grab.

The game feels more HotS than Dota, and in that I mean it's an incredibly streamlined MOBA experience with some items thrown in. The main mode is Conquest (3 lanes, towers, 'fountain', general MOBA) but there's other more streamlined modes like Arena (5v5 with emphasis on fights and no towers), Joust (3v3, one lane and you kill the 'fountain') etc, and they're where i've spent most of my time.\n\nPros:\n\nI like relic system, they give you special abilities (immunity to stuns, blink etc), but with the increased cooldowns (cd) they're almost like extra ultimate, and you can have up to 2 at any one time.\nThe game is incredibly easy to pick up and play, and while it's in first-person you don't need pro FPS skills since aiming is essentially along the horizontal plane and with most abilities having a rather forgiving effect radius you'll never struggle too much. Matches are snappy too, with most lasting 15-20 minutes, and with the way gold/XP is dished out you're generally kitted out pretty well just after the mid-games finished.  \nI've had a handful of lag problems, and by that I mean literally 2 of 50+ games have had issues, that's not too bad for me. \nFinally, the cross-play/progression is great, I can play here then just up and log into the Switch and have everything there ready to go, just a super neat thing and personally what finally made me pick this up.\n\nCons:\n\nComing from DOTA the lack of polish and QoL is pretty hard to adjust to. You can have one custom loadout per character, and there's no integrated search system for new ones or even an option to import them, you literally have to add every item and ability manually, which is baffling when DOTA 2 has the pretty damn great guides accessible during the match. No couriers here either, which means you either go teleport back to base for your new potential game-changer and trudge back or hold position and risk losing a big fight, again pretty odd omission.\n\nI bought the God pack (all the characters) after a few hours so it's fair to say I pretty like it, means I can't comment on the F2P aspect with regards character unlocks, but generally the system seems fine for the other stuff you can buy. I've also not put much time into the 'main' mode Conquest, everything else seems to be more what i'm looking for right now though. If you like MOBAs but can't be arsed with the 20+ minutes of prep time in DOTA i'd recommend this wholeheartedly. It's not as deep sure but you rarely feel like you're not doing anything and i've yet to encounter the Russians.

Please be cowtious.\n\nSo, I'm a cow. Moo. This review is made to not be amoosing at all. I'm far too serious.\n\nAnyway, as you might be able to tell from the hours I have in this game, I kinda like it just a little tiny bit. \n\n[u] PROS [/u]\n- Very diverse and changeable gameplay, \n- Frequent updates (generally 1-2 per month)\n- It's free to play\n- God pack lets you play everyone for a very reasonable price (just look at other MOBAS)\n- Everything except cosmetics can be earned by playing\n- Third person view rather than overhead\n- A very handy mute button (see below)\n\n[u] CONS [/u]\n- Updates often introduce bugs that are left till next update\n- Some changes are not what most of the community wants (eg the recent UI change)\n- Takes a long time to learn and there are few new players (so matchmaking is kinda bad)\n- A decent amount of toxic people (then you shall praise the moote button, *[i] clears throat [/i]* mute button)\n- Very hard to find games unless you are on EU/NA servers\n\nSo, what is it that makes this game so diverse you ask? Well, to begin with there is only a measly 100 playable characters (gods) to choose from across many different pantheons and more are on the way (next one is the unpronounceable snake).  There are the normal modes: Conquest (5v5), Joust (3v3), Arena (5v5), Seige (4v4), Clash (5v5), and other temporary ones. On top of this there are ranked modes for Conquest, Joust, and Duel (which obviously must be a 2v2, duh).\n\nNow, if you happen to want to watch some people play to get an idea of how it works I'm going to mention a couple of streamers which I personally think are pretty nice. \n\n[u] MsPandAlyssa [/u]\n[url=https://www.twitch.tv/MsPANDAlyssa] https://www.twitch.tv/MsPANDAlyssa [/url]\nReally nice person, plays a nice mix of casual and ranked games and makes a real effort to focus on hanging out with the chat rather than focusing on the gameplay much. Often happy to try things if you ask and if you watch long enough you can get her to dab (she hates dabs). My personal favourite.

Basically how this works is that if someone leaves or deserts the game on purpose, the other players can report that player and i'm assuming that player would get investigated and possibly banned. The only problem with this system is that THE COMMUNITY FUCKING SUCKS. Was there a player that was being toxic throughout the match? Just report them! Was there a player that died just a few too many times for your liking? Probably an intentional feeder, just report them! Are you just some asshole kid that gets salty every time you get a shitty team? Go ahead and waste Hi-Rez's time with fake reports and just report them! See the problem here? This system gives nobody any accountability for their actions, so basically anyone can report anybody for any reason and not have to give a shit whether it's a legit report or not. You could be a brand new player and still be in the process of genuinely learning the game and then get reported \"because you suck\". \nBesides the toxic community, this game runs like shit 90% of the time. The first issue shows up before I can even start up the game; I start the game and get greeted with a 3-5 minute long loading screen, which honestly I don't even keep track of how long it takes because I usually just scroll through Instagram or something for a few minutes while I wait for the game to start up. Then I finally get in the game and I start a match only to find out that I'm lagging all over the map. My internet is at an okay speed, but somehow I have 80-120 ping at all times? Then I turn on literally any other online game on my computer and I have no ping issues. K. So the game barely loads up and the ping makes it borderline unplayable, but there's some cool new skins coming out! Yay! That makes up for all of it! Right? You feel content with the game again and head to bed. But then the next day you find out that you've been logged out of your account and don't remember your password so you need to get a new one. You request a verification email, and then another one, and then another one, and then another one, but none of them actually get to you. After a few days you keep trying. Nothing. Then you reach out to Hi-Rez with your issue. No response. So how am I supposed to actually play the game? Second account. This literally happened to my friend about a week ago. I still don't think he's gotten a response about his account. \nAt this point I don't know if this is a real review or just a rant at this point, but whatever. I HATE this whole console integration thing. They changed the layout of main menu so that it is the same between PC and console. The only problem is that it FUCKING SUCKS. Was anyone really asking for this? I stopped playing some time in the middle of season 3 and came back near the end of season 5, so I came back and had no fucking clue what I was looking at. It's now a few months later and I still have trouble making my way through the main menu. It's just so damn weird and a lot of things are very hard to find. But everything is okay though, because there's a cool new skin package on sale for 600 gems, that makes it all better, right? NO. I wish Hi-Rez would focus more on getting the game to run THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO rather than throwing out skins. \nTo finish this all off, this game has it's plus sides. Underneath a shit ton of negatives, this game has a few positives. I recommend only playing this game if you have friends. There's really no reason for me to play this game alone ever again, I know it's just gonna be a horrible time. Unless you can handle playing with/against a group of middle schoolers with nothing else to care about, don't bother playing this.", "timestamp_created": 1550637913, "timestamp_updated": 1550637913, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501779019832611084", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49120636": {"recommendationid": "49120636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061773596", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 47242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550067944}, "language": "english", "review": "Unbalanced meta's.

Their riding heavily on consoles as it's basically a monopoly as there is no current Moba for consoles and no competition. As the game is hindering it self due to the horrible matchmaking and indisputable negligence from the developers.\n\nMatchmaking is the worst in this game. Anyone of you can even do this for the same experience. Simple test, enter a casual game of any kind, make sure your profile is not hidden. Almost every game if not on your team or against your team there will be a player which will not even match the criteria to play ranked yet alone be matched up with a player beyond its level. How the developers thought this was a good idea, blows my mind. The newer player obviously gets destroyed and gets bombarded with toxicity from his team and gets put off from playing the game further. The enemy team also gets mad as this isn't even a game and unfair.\n\nRanked matchmaking does this quite a bit better, as soon as you get out of the low tier's you start getting matched with players in your level and rank.\n\nThe UI is disgusting, and how it didn't get updated still blows my mind, and in-fact how it was added and forced upon the PC players at all from the previous more detailed UI is beyond belief. The people that make these decisions at Titan/HiRez need to get fired, as they are obviously pulling the game down and making horrible decisions for the game and company.\n\nConstant bugs, that can last for months before being replaced or fixed.\n\nCustomer Service from my experience has been great, and I generally get a reply from 3-7 days.

Smite is not the problem, it's a good game. Hi-Rez is the issue.\n\nIf you enjoy basically non-existent lore, cash-grabs and rigged systems, cancerous matchmaking, unbalanced and clearly developer-favored characters, bugs aplenty, one completely incapable and utterly useless CEO that holds back the whole department and one of the most toxic communities that even rivals Overwatch's community, Smite is your game.\n\nBack when I started playing, Smite was still in open beta and probably my favorite game for years. It was diverse, set itself apart from all other MOBAS through its 3rd person perspective and tons of different maps. It also had that great concept where you could just buy a skin that you wanted. But then Hi-Rez published it's first chests. There were only 2 exclusive skins, but they quickly realized how much money they could make off that garbage system. In the following years, 95% of all new skins were exclusive or limited - put in cash-grab events or chests. There was a time where there wasn't a single directly purchasable skin for 6 or more months. To this day there are still gods with well over 5 skins, all of them exclusive.\n\nLet's put this into perspective: There are literally [b]128 types of chests[/b] in this game. They range from 200gems to 400gems, so about 3,20\u20ac to 6,40\u20ac respectively, [b]per roll[/b]. As a new player, you have 0/55 items from the Curiosity Chest. Each roll costs 3,20\u20ac. The chests are also rigged, not joking here, which means you'll get the skin at ~53/55, which puts you at a staggering 170\u20ac just to get that one skin you wanted. \nAnd every single season, the grande finale of cash grabs, the so called \"odyssey\". Smite teases one \"Tier5 skin\", a skin that changes basically everything a god has to offer in terms of design. It's comparable to LoL's ultimate skins, which cost about 20\u20ac. The only issue here is, that you can't directly buy the skin. You [b]have to[/b] get a ton of other exclusive skins you probably don't even want for that one T5 skin that's barely worth 20 bucks. You'll lose about 100\u20ac, if not more, in this great \"odyssey\", as Hi-Rez likes to title it. The odyssey is also often accompanied by several \"adventures\". Adventures are basically one sort of RPG where you choose one god and kill some monsters. The catch is, this map doesn't change, the map always remains the same, and all rewards are either locked behind a paywall (who would have guessed) or a tedious grind-fest that'll probably take millions of your brain cells and about 2 weeks of your life. I'm not even going to talk about the recent \"adventure\", because that's just a pure joke.\n\nNow, bugs. Smite suffers from so many bugs, many of which are present since closed beta. Some of the more recent ones are so gamebreaking it's honestly a joke that they're not fixed yet. First off, In 99% of all matches, lobby chat just doesn't work. It won't even appear in your chat box. You can't communicate with your teammates while you pick your gods. \n\nSecond, also in 99% of all matches, one or more gods won't load in your stats screen. Which basically means, that, if you press TAB, it won't list that particular god. You can't see their items (which in turn means you don't know how to build against them), you can't see their relics, not even their score. Their kills [b] aren't even listed for your team[/b]. You basically have a ghost. \nAlso, sometimes your game just freezes on defeat or win screen and just crashes alltogether. Present since beta, they're just addressing it, after 4 years.\n\nWhile we're at it, I just want to point out Hi-Rez' favoritism, regarding both gods and modes. As you would expect with gods, there are just certain gods which are blatantly overpowered or just unfun to play against. These can usually be identified by looking at their skins, because they usually have billions. Examples would be Loki, Neith, Hercules or Nox. These are not necessarily overpowered, but have heavily bloated kits which make them almost unkillable and totally unfun to play against. \nNow modes. Like I said before, Smite has a multitude of gamemodes, many more than Hots, LoL or DotA. Now, the issue is, the whole game is balanced around the \"main\" mode, Conquest; the typical 5v5 tower-and-minion-push mode, which every moba has. In my 4 years of Smite, I have played 18 matches of Conquest. To compare, I've played over 2000 matches of Arena (5v5 without towers), 600 in Joust (3v3), 500 in Siege (4v4) and 900 matches of Clash (5v5 mix between Conquest and Arena). I never really found the ambition to learn all 4851 rules of Conquest, so I stuck to the other gamemodes which barely required 2 of my 5 braincells. Hi-Rez just tries to force Conquest down your throat at every single possible moment. IIRC, one of the design-leaders even talked about removing other modes so people would flock to Conquest. This alone truly catches the sheer incompetence of Hi-Rez's executives. Most players even stated they would quit before they'd even touch Conquest.\n\nAt last, Smite's community. I'm more of a casual and average player, but every single match you're plagued by atleast one incredibly inept (most of the time they're low level because matchmaking sucks) or toxic player, sometimes even both. The problem is, that just like in many other games, most players think way too highly of themselves. But Smite players take the cake. They not only play gods, they [i]think they are gods.[/i] The ultimate pinacle of garbage this game has to offer can be found on reddit. You can't criticize one single god without some white knight showing up and defending their true love like there's no tomorrow, because \"muh waifu\". It's one of the most toxic communites you'll ever see in any videogame, so rev up these mute buttons. Just be aware that you can't mute incompetence. Also, the matchmaking is so fucking bad that I have a legit 85% winrate this season. Every game balances the winrate around 50%.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm fascinated that both Hi-Rez and Smite are still alive. Hi-Rez ran so many good games into the ground, gunned them down in the streets or left them to rot in their bug-infested basement, it's a miracle that the company isn't bankrupt. Play this game if you want, but you'll be disappointed in the long run, which is the worst kind of disappointment. Many years I've defended both Hi-Rez and Smite, but at this state, it doesn't make any sense to.

Rather than losing an integral part of what makes other MOBAs enjoyable and meaty, it replaces them with what gives games like first-person and third-person shooters depth. It panders to and compliments a different style, giving a different experience but in a familiar format. \n\nMinions aren't as relevant late game as they are in Dota, but it feels right. You're playing the role of a god, and by the time you're at end-game, you have bigger threats to worry about-- other gods. It's satisfying to build a tank that 5 enemy gods and a tower, all at once, can't easily kill. It feels great to have your team expect you to clutch, but succumb to the pressure and miss all your shots. I love saving a teammate at the last possible moment by landing a perfectly aimed and timed kiss from Aphrodite, which stun locks the enemy. \n\nIt's about timing, weaving in and out of battle, aim and speed. Team fights are intense and replicate the rush you'd expect from a competitive shooter, all while respecting the governing outline of a MOBA. That makes SMITE a truly unique experience.\n\nMost people who claim SMITE \"sucks\", play LoL or Dota. They see other games within the same genre as direct competition to the game they love. They don't care about enjoying games for what they offer; they compare and contrast simply to feel like they\u2019re part of a team\u2014for the sake of ego. It\u2019s as though they themselves had a hand in the game development; they're very, very proud.\n\nMost of them like to say SMITE\u2019s not as deep. I argue the opposite. I feel where it lets go in micromanaging, it substitutes with a skill-oriented, high speed combat experience. It has depth and develops a skillset absent from other MOBAs. So it comes down to misunderstanding the skills necessary in SMITE. \n\nI've been playing SMITE for probably a year now. I should have at least 300 hours, perhaps more. I wish my friends would play with me, but most of them have 'standards' and strongly draw the line after LoL. They\u2019re better than Smite, and If I want to play with them, I\u2019m going to have to play their favorite MOBA. \n\nIt would enhance my experience to play with them on SMITE, but even without a single friend, this game has kept my attention and I'll continue to play it.\n\nMoreover, SMITE is constantly evolving. New skins, new gods, new maps, redesigns, new items, nerfs, buffs, new UI, etc. In the short amount of time I've played the game, I've seen many drastic changes. If you tried Smite years ago, it\u2019s a promise that this SMITE is a completely different game today-- by this time next year, it'll have drastically changed again. All these changes are enhancements and true refinements to the game. It continues to get better and better, and HiRez listens to the players. \n\nSMITE literally looks different graphically and the devs aren't scared to try some pretty wacky shit to make things more fun but balanced.\n\nFree to play; pay to look cool. Smite's become one of my favorite games of all time.\u3000\n\nNote: I play LoL, Dota and Heroes of The Storm as well. \n\n\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u304f\u308c\u3066\u305b\u3093\u304d\u3085\u3046\uff5e", "timestamp_created": 1443681097, "timestamp_updated": 1472988647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 215, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.889149606227874756", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42352440": {"recommendationid": "42352440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018230094", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 102665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 334, "last_played": 1551335377}, "language": "english", "review": "A game that is absolutely in the deathgrip of a bad decision driven company.  This game is no longer about the love and passion that was felt years ago.  The steady decisions to ignore or just flat out be incompetent at addressing the communities complaints are the only real constant here, to be honest. Oh, and a constant influx of new bugs while old ones remain and even evolve in annoyance.\n\n[b]God Design[/b]\nI have been an active player of this game for about 5 years, (Athena's release).  As a reference, this is about midway through beta.  I've got 2440H and 55M, so almost about 700 hours additional to the numbers shown here in Steam.  It seems like every hour I play these days is just enjoyed less and less.  During beta, and early season 1 + 2, there was a really heartfelt development aura that you could feel with every patch.  The gods that came out were much more enjoyable than almost everything that's come out during the past year or so, (I will admit, I do love Cerberus.)  But when you compare gods like Chernobog, Achilles, Hachiman, and Thoth to gods like Tyr, Ah Muzen Cab, Janus, and Scylla, you can just tell there really isn't much actualy originality being dumped into these kits.  They may have one mechanic that is new and exciting, but other than that, its just a better version of a previous gods ability and a boring passive slapped onto it to make it feel like its actually fresh.  (It isn't)\n\n[b]Chests[/b]\nNow you've got the community wide absolutely hated chest mechanic.  Originally when chests came out, they were all right.  There was a chest with approx 55 items in it, including voice packs, higher tier skins.  It was pretty cool.  Also included was the new Nuclear Ymir skin and Derpules skin.  Neither of these skins were really that out there as far as the original appearance, but they had nice little gimmicks.  Derpules took the joke of the community hating new hercules model's tiny head and took it further, giving him a pea sized head and a funny helium voice pack.  Nuclear ymir was also just a bright green version of ymir with a fun and unique voice pack and some pretty impressive effects added on.  These two skins were not exactly incredible, but they were fun and acquirable if you had already invested into much of the (much smaller) cosmetic inventory.  Now, every single patch that comes out, there is a new chest (Sometimes even three), slapped full of random older skins and all kinds of miscelleaneous cosmetic bullshit that shouldn't be in the game either.  I believe it was something along the lines of 8 months before an actual Direct purchase skin was released.  Everything was a gamble.  And that is bullshit.  Many of the skins are now just unoriginal theme crap, \n\n[b]Community Relations[/b]\nLast year Hi-rez also had many of their employees be let go, quit, or fired.  Nearly every member of this employee pool was a well known, well liked asset of the community.  Now the company is flooded with all of these people that don't seem to even really give a shit about engaging in the community.  SNK8Four is my prime example.  This man was absolutely adored by the community, the pro scene, and pretty much anyone that began watching smite on twitch in its early days.  He was very much the face for many people that began early.  Then just one day, he's gone.  (To be fair, Hi-Rez no longer deserves him.)  So these decisions are just weird from an outside perspective.  The new character design lead is just full of shit, the new artwork / effect guy (HiRezChuck or some shit) is just a flat disppointment with everything, (WE NEED MORE ANIME AND SKULLS GUYS). Its really just confusing to see this massive sweeping directional change that the game has had, especially considering HiRez floundered their partnership with Tencent which included remodeling and removing pretty much everything in the game with skulls, and now they are just fucking everywhere.  Its edgy and annoying.\n\n[b]Matchmaking[/b]\nHere's one that was brought up in the comments, and should rightfully be added.  I guess I'm just too numb to it at this point to have thought it up while typing.  The matchmaking in this game, is terrible.  Absolutely terrible.  The queues are diluted because there are so many.\n\nHere is a list of all game modes and a short description\n[i]Conquest[/i] - The tried and true three lanes and jungle MOBA format.\n[i]Siege[/i] - Two lane smaller map, with 4v4 and an objective boss in the middle to facilitate pushing.  Intended to be a somewhat shorter mini conquest.\n[i]Arena[/i] - 5v5 Death match, minimal wave farming.  Its pretty much just the chance to beat the snot out of each other.  This is the game that is ranked as the most popular.\n[i]Clash[/i] - Also kind of a mini conquest, however its 5v5 still with far less focus on jungle, as the lanes are closer together.  Pretty much arena with a little bit more farming and a center objective boss.\n[i]Joust[i/] - 3v3 Single lane, small side jungles and an objective boss in the middle portion.  Also a more popular game mode than Conquest.\n[i]Duel[/i] - 1v1 Joust on same map.  Ranked only\n[i]Assault[/i] - All random gods 5v5 one lane.  No backing until death.\n[i]Mode of the day[/i] - Random garbage that cycles through every day.  (All same god no cooldowns etc)\n\nWith all of this, you can sit in queues for 10+min just to find a conquest game.  Arena game queues are quick, but we all get matched with a random group of people it seems.  People with 100 hours fighting me and my buddies who combine for like 6k hours.  Ranked divisions seem to have minimal impact also.  Diamond queues up, waits 4 mins for a game, then is on a team full of golds against golds.  A+\n\n[b]God balance[/b]\nThis is Hirez's biggest problem, in my opinion.  I get the skins in chests thing.  I get the god design thing.  I get the business/employee thing.  But when your game is about beating the crap out of each other, is it not an all around better idea to focus on improving that aspect?  New gods are horribly bloated, every ability becoming a novel to read as opposed to the long forgotten \"This ability will hurt people in front of you\" mechanic.  Old gods are left to rot, unless Hirez has decided to do massive sweeping changes to an entire kit, buffing three separate things about them and then wondering why they are overtuned, of which they will then follow with sweeping nerfs that do not address the new problems and simply deteriorate a god to uselessness once more.  OP Gods sit at that stage for a much longer period of time than you would expect.  Conveniently when the oddyssey skin for Ullr came out, (Buy all the items throughout a time period = approx 140$USD), Ullr managed to sit at 100% P/B rate for Months.  MONTHS.  Tiny little nerfs came in to give the appearance of adjustment, but it was incredibly shallow and obvious.  3 months after the skin came out and was no longer acquirable, he was hit with multiple nerfs, bringing him in line. When a new god is released, there are two possible scenarios.   \n\nScenario 1) This god is unstoppable.  He can do everything by himself, requires no assistance, and will absolutely make everyone else have 0 fun, if the person playing them took the 10 mins it usually take to figure out the core mechanics of this god.\n\nScenario 2) This god is absolutely horrible.  The kit is just a mishmash of clashing abilities which in no way shape or form synergize together and will just serve as three random situational abilities with an ult that hopefully does something, (Looking at you Chernobog).  \n\n\nThis game is a huge part of my life, and I do not want to even KNOW how much money I have actually spent on it over the years, including a +1500$ to the world championships in January of 2015.  (EDIT - I forgot I also attended in 2016)\n\nBut, it is also a huge regret and a downward slope.

That's why it just sucks and honestly feels wrong to give it such a negative review. I've put over 1.5k hours into the game, paid for hundreds of dollars worth of chests and skins, and had a ton of fun with the game, all while trying my best to ignore its flaws. However, I can't ignore the flaws anymore; the game has become too much focused around chest opening and limited item collecting for it to be fun anymore.\n\nI was planning on writing an elaborate analysis of all the things wrong with the game, but I came to realize only one thing is truly wrong with the game; Hirez Studios. They had created a near-masterpiece of a game that was unique to the MOBA genre and excellent in every way, but the overwhelming flaws have drowned the game and distanced it from which it once was. Hirez has failed in three majors items; the balancing and development of their game, the handling of their community, and the growth of the game as an esport. \n\nBalancing: With each new champion arriving on the \"Battleground of the Gods\", I've always been scared of what monster Hirez has cooked up and their implementation of the new god into the game. After having lasting through releases of characters who dominated the casual queues from the instance of their arrivals into the game such as Artyo, Cernunnos, or even Bellona, Camazotz, Thoth, or Terra (god forbid a god release like Terra happens again), the only time the game comes even close to being balanced is after a patch that doesn't include a new god - or, if a new god is launched into the game with enormous amounts of nerfs. Hirez is REALLY awful about this - they put new characters into a game that dominate all of the casual queues for the next two weeks until the next patch is launched. I can SPECIFICALLY remember quitting the game for a month when Artyo was released because she was so overwhelming and aggravating to play against, and other circumstances where I quit for weeks at a time upon the release of gods like Thoth or Terra. Hirez has absolutely NO CLUE how to properly launch a god into the game, and ruins the experience of her playerbase by refusing to undo what they've done for weeks at a time. They have such an awful mentality that once something is put into the game, it shouldn't be removed; the item Fatalis, for instance, was in the game for FIVE years before finally being split into several less powerful items and removed from the game within the last year. They have never possessed the ability to launch new gods or items without a plethora of new issues, glitches, or balancing problems with each new implementation. They also think every new god has to be their own special snowflake; simple kids do not exist in gods anymore. Every new god must have at least 2 forms of CC, 3 damaging abilities, a very unique passive that works with their abilities, or an ultimate that works with all of their abilities. I'm not saying that creativity and trying new things is bad; Hirez just releases gods that are so bloated and broken that even when they are nerfed, they are still the best characters in the game. If you look at this tier list (http://smite.guru/tierlists/l/JD), pulled from a popular community website, out of the five best characters in the game, three were released within the last few months. This is astounding - with a god pool of 92 characters, why is it that characters so recently released are without a doubt the best in the game? Now look at the bottom of the list - EVERY CHARACTER EXCEPT TWO in the A-, B, or C tiers was one of the first 30 gods that released into the game, with the exception of (I believe) Camazotz and Ah Puch. Hirez has absolutely no idea how to balance the old with the new, and comes out with a new and broken god complete with new and broken items on the regular. Honestly, a random-number-generator would be better at balancing item stats and god ability damages than Hirez. \n\nCOMMUNITY AND ESPORT: The way in which Hirez interacts with their community and their transition of the game into an esport has several linking issues, so I'll talk about them both. Hirez has absolutely no respect for the voices of their competitive players or for the voices of their community. If you refer to Hirez's employee reviews on glassdoor (https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Hi-Rez-Studios-Reviews-E200165.htm), you can easily see that the real, negative reviews of the bad management of the company entirely outnumber the fake, 5 star reviews of anonymous accounts. These negative reviews fit exactly with my perspective of the company; the employees are great, but they get out when they can because the overwhelming (and sometimes underwhelming) presence and pressures of the erractic CEO and headstaff are so AWFUL. THE GAME WAS BUILT AWESOME  BY AWESOME EMPLOYEES; however, these employees are gone, and with good reason. With the loss of community heads Bart and Kelly, Smite has dissolved into Chest Opening Simulator 2017 and Cosmetics Purchasing Simulator 2017. Their disregard for the LATAM and Oceanic competitive scenes as well as the overall competitive scene has shown the inability of the higher-ups in the company to be able to keep Smite at the peak level it once was. Smite peaked in 2013 and early 2014 - the Smite Launch Tournament, which was croud-funded by the Odyssey, had a prize pool of 2.3 million dollars - the third greatest Esports prize pool at the time. With each subsequent year, the tournament prize pool has decreased as Hirez's game has begun to die and they've become greedier and greedier. This year, the number of cosmetics and items released in the Odyssey have increased in price and in number are far more than what they were three years ago. THIS IS A PROBLEM. The Odyssey was established as a way to make money for the Smite World Championship every year, yet after a successful first year they decided to cap the winnings for the tourament at $1 million dollars? What happened to the rest of the money from the Odyssey that was spent on in game items and cosmetics? It went right into the pocket of the greedy heads of Hirez, when it should have gone to things like the establishment of MORE and BETTER dedicated servers for games, bug fixes, competitive prize pools, balancing, and other items the community has been begging for for YEARS and Hirez has continued to ignore them. The worst part of all this? Six months ago, Hirez came out and RECOGNIZED their flaws, fixed one or two, and claimed to be working on the rest. The game still sucks, Hirez?!?!? Where did you go???\n\nHirez is NOT a good company, and they have absolutely no potential to allow such an amazing game to grow as long as idiots are at the helm. SMITE peaked in 2013 and 2014. Every subsequent year has been a disappointment, and after a complete disregard for the community and competitive scene as well as a complete failure to balance the game, I'm finally done with Smite. \n\nIf you're looking to play it casually with a friend every now and then, go for it!

If you've always wanted to try a MOBA, but you don't like point-and-click RTS controls, SMITE is the perfect entry point for you.\n[*]The gameplay is mechanically solid and surprisingly deep. Most characters can pull off satisfying combos, and every character can use their skills and abilities in surprising ways. Plus, the game rewards you for mastering its hidden tech. The better you are at SMITE, the more fun you'll have.\n[*]Conquest, the premiere gamemode, is staggeringly complex. There are tons of strategies and mechanics to wrap your head around. Overall, though, SMITE is very noob friendly, with lots of simple game modes to help you learn the ropes.\n[*]Teamwork is rewarding. Nothing compares to the feeling of communicating with teammates, coming up with a plan, and pulling it off without a hitch.\n[*]Huge variety of characters, all based on cool mythological figures. Some gods, like Zeus and Thor, are well-known. There are also lesser-known gods, like Janus and Baron Samedi. Every character feels different, though some feel better to play than others.\n[*]Fast, regular balance cycle. The devs update the game once every two weeks.\n[*]Unlike a lot of MOBAs, the majority of the characters are viable in ranked play. Makes for some pretty interesting matches.\n[*]Barring the occasional sustain meta, healers aren't as important in SMITE as they are in other MOBAs, which makes fights more impactful.\n[*]Despite what some people will tell you, the game is relatively balanced (the key word is relatively), and it's getting better. The current season is the best yet.\n[*]Not as predatory as other free-to-play games. You don't need to spend money to unlock characters, although you can unlock every character instantly for $30.\n[/list]\n\nCONS:\n\n[list]\n[*]This game has a really steep learning curve. Like I said, there are plenty of simple game modes for beginners, but learning to play Conquest is tough.\n[*]Lots of bugs, some of which are game-breaking. The worst bugs are usually hotfixed within a day.\n[*]This game has a sizeable playerbase, but the players are split between three platforms and eleven game modes, making the playerbase feel lower than it really is. It also results in long queue times. Casual Conquest takes four minutes. Ranked Conquest takes nine minutes. Queue times may improve when cross-platform matchmaking is introduced.\n[*]As with all popular multiplayer games, the players can be toxic. Most SMITE players are good people, but it only takes one toxic player to ruin a match.\n[*]Hirez Studios, the publisher, makes a lot of weird decisions. For example, the SMITE Pro League is broadcast exclusively on Mixer.\n[*]General lack of polish. The flavor text has bad grammar, the UI is a little weird, and the game is poorly optimized.\n[/list]\n\nIf you like the idea of playing a MOBA, but you want a more intuitive control scheme, SMITE is your best bet. The game is fun, even if it lacks polish.", "timestamp_created": 1540617039, "timestamp_updated": 1542925784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 64, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.840046882629394531", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18704938": {"recommendationid": "18704938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111631620", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 19892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494081674}, "language": "english", "review": "I think it's about time I finally review this game.\n\nI've had a history with this game. I've played this game since Isis was released, which was over 2 years ago. I remember that I was a HUGE fan of the old Sun Wukong (Hun Batz nowadays) and enjoyed the game, although I never got hooked into it. I eventually just stopped playing and went to get addicted to other games, namely Team Fortress 2. Fast foward to 2015, where SMITE is finally released on Steam. I was very curious to give this another try, so I did. Now, before I continue, I have something to say. All of my good friends know this fact well, and I HEAVILY emphasize this:\n\n[b]I hate MOBA games.[/b]\n\nLong story with that, but I just never liked them, besides Awesomenauts. I downloaded SMITE and gave it a second chance, figuring it might be pretty cool now. Okay, this is the part where you look at the number of hours I have in the game. Just take a nice, solid look at it. To the review!\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nMOBAs aren't known to have god-tier graphics (heh) and SMITE is no exception. The game is just... eh. It's sort of bland, but at the same time it actually looks really nice in some places, like Siege and Conquest. Not much to say here, but this is not a game for the photographers out there like myself.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe big question to this is, \"Is SMITE a good enough MOBA to compare with LoL and DOTA?\" The answer to that question is, well, yes! I find it much better to BE the character your playing as, rather than telling them what to do. It's what makes SMITE stand out from the rest of the crowd, and it shines brightly in this way. I don't want to start a flame war, but although it is very simple to understand, the game is much more difficult to master because of the fact you have to actually LAND your shots. No more \"clicky-clicky here's the part where 3 champions die\" or whatever. Your abilities matter, and missing one could change the course of a game. Plus, of course, teamwork is important in Conquest, and I haven't actually encountered many \"OP\" gods, if any at all. Some items are clearly better than others *cough* bluestone pendant *cough* *cough* but most aren't too severe. Overall, SMITE delivers with the gameplay by miles.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nJust like whether or not Set will be added to the game, there is no known story. This will not be counted towards the final score.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\n\nThe audio isn't all that special, but the some of the voice packs you can purchase for gods are actually really funny. Some of the writing is extremely clever and gives the game a LOT of personality.\n\n[h1]Replayability[/h1]\n\nCompared to DOTA and LoL, this game is much easier to pick up and play, although still being a very competitive game. The community, although not sunshine and rainbows, is much easier to deal with and far friendlier than those other toxic wastes of \"communities.\" The gameplay, as said earlier, is simple and it doesn't require too much experience to understand, however I would recommend staying away from Conquest in that case. There are also daily rewards, but I don't like the fact that the prizes don't get increasingly better after 7 days, because it doesn't feel right getting 75 Favor for playing 8 days of SMITE. Invest the time, however, and it'll greatly pay off. Trust me on that.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nIn the end, SMITE gives me a much better point of view on MOBAs, my least favorite genre of gaming. I can easily recommend this game if you don't want to go through a brutal experience like DOTA and LoL, and the fact that it brings out its differences with pride makes it one of the most enjoyable and addictive games I've played since Team Fortress 2. \n\n[b]Graphics[/b] - 6.5/10\n[b]Gameplay[/b] - 9.5/10\n[b]Story[/b] - NONE\n[b]Audio[/b] - 8.5/10\n[b]Replayability[/b] - 9.0/10\n\n[b]**[u]PERSONAL PICK[/u]**[/b]\n\n[b].:8.5/10:.[/b]\n\n+Unique third person view\n+Friendly community (mostly)\n+Skins & voice packs give the gods charm\n+Simple to learn, truly hard to master\n+References galore!\n\n-Bland graphics\n-Daily rewards needs small improvement\n-Audio (aside from voice packs) isn't very memorable", "timestamp_created": 1445910073, "timestamp_updated": 1500913781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 160, "votes_funny": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.87396007776260376", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23288930": {"recommendationid": "23288930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025288784", "num_games_owned": 390, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472461381}, "language": "english", "review": "The MOBA for people who don't like MOBAs", "timestamp_created": 1464606840, "timestamp_updated": 1464606840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 352, "votes_funny": 136, "weighted_vote_score": "0.877540349960327148", "comment_count": 17, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17941408": {"recommendationid": "17941408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014976083", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 117101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518526495}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] English [/h1] \n\nSMITE is an incredibly fun and addicting 3rd person MOBA that is perfect for those who are looking for a change from your typical MOBA.

Smite to me is one of the best games ever and has massive potential especially this year with paragon and other 3rd person moba's shutting down.  But Hi-rez being the bad company they have always been seemed to mess that up almost as bad a realm royale.  The game isn't so new player friendly and will probably never be.  I've said this over and over again and i will keep saying it, Smite along with Hi-rez will not last another season, season 6 will be their downfall.  They do not listen to the community very well, and will just make skins and more skins and put them in chest that cost like 300-400 gems, and like i get ya got to make money on a f2p game, but it gets the point where it seems like a scam.  It pains me that the community itself doesn't even realize how dead the game is becoming and will soon shut down later next year in 2019 due to how stupid Hi-rez is and will forever be.  Elo, MMR, whatever you wanna call it has always been worst than most multiplayer games, and this is coming from someone who has competed on levels with pros in their prime and has been in challengers, i can say matchmaking is disgustingly bad and will probably stay that way.  I have had a few times where i feel like i can actually enjoy the game, but thats so short compared to the rest of my time playing.  Another big issue with Smite is the coding, its extremely outdated and they refuse to overhaul the coding and make it modern and less buggy, if they can simply do that i can assure you smite can last for years on just that alone.  But sadly thats not the case and all Smite is now these days is just a skin simulator.  SWC, or Smite Worlds this year has the been worst in terms of the size, production, and just quality in general was horrible and they still refused to fix any of the issues that happened during worlds.  I love this game to death and that was just a few of the issues i had with the game, and if just Hi-rez went 1-2 patches without skins, accessories or just any bs and just focus on bug fixes, overhauling the coding, item bug fixes/balancing, and god bug fixes/balancing i can assure you smite can be as great as LoL and Dota 2, but will probably remain in their shadows till Smite Shuts down.

In the end, this is the only MOBA that I still even play, and haven't uninstalled for years.\n\nHowever, the time to uninstall may have come.\n\nHi-Rez decided suddenly, without any notices or warnings, to increase the price of gems (in-game currency) by about 2 times in my country and a few others.\nAnd after a brief discussion with support about the reasons, turns out, it was a concious decision on their part. They simply screwed a huge part of their playerbase, and the only reason they gave is \"exchange rate\". Well, let me tell you right now, that exchange rate of Dollar to Rouble did not change noticeably for years. And definitely did not suddenly double. And the price of gems has stayed the same since at the very least 2016. You can google the exchange rate for 2016-2018 yourself if you do not believe me.\n\nSuch practices are straight up unacceptable. Not only did this doubling the prices screw the affected players in the long run, for obvious reasons, but it also screwed us in the short run, since they did it in the middle of their \"Divine Uprising\" event. For those that don't know, events like these require you to pay for and spend gems during the lifetime of event, that usually lasts for months, so in the end you can get a fancy exclusive skin. So those of us who already spent some money to get the delicious Tier 5 skin are now doubly screwed. We either have to pay their increased prices to get it, or mourn the loss of money we've already invested, because paying double is ridiculous. \n\nThis horrible, predatory decision is borderline a fraud on their part.

It was very good in Season 3, but then came Season 4 and everything changed. In Season 4, Hi-Rez realised \"we don't need to care about the game, we only need to care about the money\". So they started to release lots of very good lookin new skins (in my opinion smite skins are the best looking skins of all mobas), but skins won't balance a game. With season 4 started the tank meta, so everyone was just playing Guardians and Warriors. If you looked at the esl, mostly tanks were played, too. It was a pain in the ass if you wanted to have fun with other gods too. But the good thing was that not many people cared about the meta in casual modes. As Season 4 ended the new Tier5 skin for Ullr was announced and as we know Hi-Rez, they realised the chance of making a fuck ton of money. So they buffed Ullr extremely, so everybody wanted to play him and everybody wanted the new skin for their \"main\". After the release of the Tier5 Ullr got nerfed pretty fast, because this skin was limited and Hi-Rez has made their money. The tank meta got a bit controlled with some new patches, changing items and nerfing tank abilities. We are now at the start of Season 5, February 2018. Everything was ok-ish. Bugs started to spread over Smite, first only some visual bugs, some of them very funny. But then it got worse with each single patch. The bugs started to affect god abilities, game's latency and some minor other stuff. Hi-Rez releases a patch each 2 weeks. So the bugs started to spread very fast. I'm writing this review on 4 May 2018 and I can tell that I have never played a game before, which was as buggy as Smite. Look at my Steam Library, I played a bunch of games. But bugs are only one of our problems, there were more. The tank meta started to come back with new Guardians and Warriors in the god releases, so tanks did more dmg than any other class while being more tanky and having more Crowd Control than any other class. Now everyone was obsessed by the meta. Of about 95 gods in the game, only 20 were played (you actually saw only 20 different gods in like 10 matches until you saw a non-meta god). This is a huge problem in my opinion, because if you like to play a god, you can't play him, because he's not in the meta and no matter how good you are, you will play worse than you could. This resulted in a heavy harassment wave. If you didn't pick a meta god, you would get flamed, reported etc. (mostly in Russian, because this game has a big russian community, I myself learned to understand the Russian language because of Smite, so it's good if you try to learn russian). Know you probably think: But Xovio, this only happens in the high elo. I can tell you that you're absolutely wrong, because there is no thing called \"elo\" in Smite. \"You just started the game? Here are people who played the game for 500+ hours to help you get started\" \"You lost 14 matches in a row? Maybe if you fight against people with 2000+ you'll learn how to play it!\" It's not fun for the experienced players, neither is it fun for the new players.\n\nAnd now we should look at what Hi-Rez did against these problems:\n\nThey released new skins and cosmetics to buy.\n\n\nGood evening guys!", "timestamp_created": 1525446324, "timestamp_updated": 1525446324, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 138, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819551706314086914", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17951870": {"recommendationid": "17951870", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963213304", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 36544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1543658164}, "language": "english", "review": "Note: I have 1000+ hours pre-steam.\n\nIf you've got the stomach for objective based multiplayer deathmatch, you should give this a try. For those familiar with MOBAs the structure of the game will be familiar. But for those that don't know, two teams of 5 try to push across a field to each others base, breaking defensive towers on the way, trying to stay alive and make the enemy die. There are other game modes but they mostly sit as variations on this theme.\n\nWhat really sets SMITE apart is the way you control your hero. Rather than the awkward click to move and attack system of other MOBAs you move with WASD, and aim your attacks as you would in a shooter, with your mouse. In SMITE 99% of the attacks are skillshots. Dodging is a real tactic, and you do it by moving, not submitting a request to move via your mouse cursor. There are more than enough characters for you to find several you're excited about playing. The game comes to you in layers, as you become comfortable moving around, aiming, and dodging, you begin to see new opportunities to improve. Whether it's making a smart predictive shot through the wall, or suckering an opponent into attacking you when you have a hidden teamate nearby, you'll start to get hype on smart plays, and you'll feel the pressure of avoiding your opponent's in turn. Integration with curse voice is nice, and even if you don't feel like jumping on the mic, there are shortcut keys to make tons of useful communications. This takes some getting used to but you get fast on it.\n\nThe game is at it's best in Conquest(the primary mode), but sadly is plagued by the same problem every other MOBA has. There is one map, with one set of objectives. As far as I know Heroes of the Storm is the only game that has bothered offering some variety in the 5v5 queue. I'd like to see them slow down the release of new heroes a bit, and offer some interesting twists in the 5v5 matches.\n\nThere is absolutely no pay to win system, and while there's always a lingering balance issue here or there, it's usually not really gamebreaking, and rarely will be enough to stop the better player from winning. You can unlock all the gods through gameplay, and color swaps for thier default skins. That said, the ultimate god pack, unlocks all the gods, current and future, and I strongly recommend it. It's a good way to support the game and it gives you all the toys to play with in your matches. I paid $40 for it, and I ain't even mad. The rest of the cash shop is premium skins and other vanity items, my only gripe in the cash shop are the \"chests\".

The gamemodes include a 5v5 Arena, 3v3 Joust, 5v5 Conquest, 5v5 Clash, 4v4 Siege, 5v5 Assault and a gamemode of the day that always offers something different. The matchmaking is on a decent timer usually taking anywhere from 20 seconds to 3 or 4 minutes to find a match (usually, ranked can easily take longer). \n\nIn smite there are gods from a handful of pantheons actually to be exact 76 gods in the game as of now, each with varying usefulness depending on the situation. An amazing thing which personally all MOBA games *cough* League *cough* should do is have an ultimate pack like Smite. This ultimate packs includes every single god in Smite, present and future, for one purchase and it is honestly one of the greatest things available. Smite also offers its premium currency as a daily reward and has a good community. By a good community I mean that this game has a good community, not a perfect community, don't get me wrong you WILL run into toxic individuals. I personally play joust and the people I find are kind and helpful and usually understanding, but what people need to understand is the every single MOBA is toxic and smite, for me, seems to be toxic mostly within arena and conquest although you will run into horrible people in other gamemodes as well.  \n\n[h1] Graphics/Sounds[/h1]\n\nThe environment in smite is highly detailed and the maps such as joust also have the perk of being quite colorful and interesting in their design. The game also contains music packs which you can gain along with announcer packs which change the default ones given and are able to make your experience quite better if you get the right pack.\n\n[h1] Pros/Cons[/h1]\n\n[b] Pros[/b]\n\n+ Third Person MOBA\n+ Good tutorials \n+ 7 different normal gamemodes\n+ Ultimate god pack\n+ Game events\n+ Actual god lore (I mean I could read up on it, but it's a nice thing to look at when in que for a match)\n+ Fun to play\n+ Much better community than Dota or League (in my opinion)\n\n[b] Cons[/b]\n\n- Certain toxic gamemodes (gamemodes where you will almost definitely run into someone who worsens your experience)\n- Achievement Glitch (if you already had a smite account and got a major portion of achievements, those achievements will NOT unlock on steam)\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts[/h1]\n\nI love smite, I won't hide the fact that this game has caught me perfectly. I have 420 hours on record of the time of this review being written and I don't regret a single second. I've met great people who I still regularly play with and I've also met people who simply stunned me (NOT in a good way). I usually play Joust and Assault like crazy because those are the two gamemodes I started with. Now I'm trying to get into conquest, but it's a completely different way of playing when you compare Joust and Conquest. I tried League and I hated it, simply hated it. I tried Dota for awhile, but once Russians and others started yelling at me in different languages because of their own mistakes I dropped Dota too. Then finally Smite was released on steam and I bought the god pack within the first 2-3 weeks of playing and I played with some of my close friends. I left smite for a while just before season 3, but now I've come back and nearly doubled my hours since I took my extended break. \n\nFor someone to be able to write an in-depth review for this game you need around 100 hours in my personal opinion before you've actually started to truly experience the game, but for a funny and quick review a lower time is perfectly alright. You can't go in-depth, truly in-depth with a review for this game with little hours. If you have under 30 then you simply don't know practically anything about this game! Anyway, I do love this game and am glad I found a MOBA which I actually like.\n\n[h1] TL; DR[/h1]\n\nAs the funny review which made me try this game said \"Smite is the MOBA for people who hate MOBA's\". This is a MOBA in third person where you aim all of your abilities and basic attacks, not just click and wait. The game contains 76 gods and 7 different normal gamemodes (not including custom/bot/ranked) at this time so there is a lot of variety for players to try things out. You will run into toxic people, don't get me wrong, but you will also most likely be able to meet good people in different gamemodes as you continue to play who will help you out, be supportive, and compliment you.", "timestamp_created": 1463081297, "timestamp_updated": 1464376225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 121, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835195600986480713", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32316343": {"recommendationid": "32316343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121844375", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 24956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1530985125}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the best moba games.", "timestamp_created": 1497097272, "timestamp_updated": 1497097272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 212, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.807723462581634521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18348676": {"recommendationid": "18348676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105173910", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 12488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1528920721}, "language": "english", "review": "this game helped me pass my mythology class", "timestamp_created": 1444093934, "timestamp_updated": 1444093934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 399, "votes_funny": 712, "weighted_vote_score": "0.828849852085113525", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18820894": {"recommendationid": "18820894", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969548503", "num_games_owned": 389, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 13860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505564668}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay... with just hitting lvl 30 and close to 200 hrs under my belt.

[/b] \nAnd you start out with some of the best gods in the game! \n\nYmir is a hard hitting Guardian who can tank many hits while dishing out tons of damage back!\n\nNeith who can achieve a monstrous amount of damage late game and sustain herself with her abilities. \n\nThor similar to Neith can achieve a ton of damage and tank hits quite well compared to other assassins, and is considered one of, if not the best assassin in the game.\n\nRa who is a hard hitting magic healer who is one of the fastest mages in the game.\n\nAnd finally Guan Yu who is tanky and very annoying to fight against! \n\nAlong with 5 other gods on a weekly rotation, plus you can get some free gods and skins too by following SMITE on social Media and using a program called Curse! Don\u2019t worry everyone these are all legit and supported by Hi Rez!\n\nhttps://www.smitegame.com/community/facebook/ <- This gives you a Ra skin!\n\nhttp://www.smitegame.com/community/youtube/ <- This gives Nu Wa and her Water Dancer skin!\n\nhttp://www.smitegame.com/community/twitter/ <- This gives you Artemis and her Stalker Skin!\n\nhttp://esports.smitegame.com/facebook/ <- This gives you Janus and his Keymaster Skin!\n\nhttps://www.smitegame.com/xbox-link/ <- Got an Xbox One? Link your Xbox account with your Hi Rez account to get Zeus and his X Skin!\n\nhttps://www.smitegame.com/ps4/ <- More of a PS4 Guy? Same deal as above but with your PS4 account, and you get Odin and his Worlds Collide Skin!\n\nAnd finally is Curse, I cannot post the link due to Steam hating it, however just type Curse SMITE into your Browser and it should take you to the page. Use Curse in one game to get 200 Gems! 5 for Apollo and his Curse Skin! And 10 for Agni and his Curse Skin!\n\nSo you can get 7 Free gods just by doing the above! Plus the extra skins are little sweeteners.\n\n[b] A lot of gamemodes! [/b] \n\nThere\u2019s the main game conquest, Joust, Siege, Arena, Clash and more! If there\u2019s one mode you don\u2019t like, there are still plenty of options!\n\n[b] Brilliant Animations and character designs [/b]\n\nAll of the animations of the characters fit them brilliantly, plus all the gods stand out and they don\u2019t blend in with each other, my personal favourite animations are from Ao Kuang, who has fantastic attack animations, the way he puts his sword away, and how he reveals his \u201cTrue Form\u201d to an unlucky enemy. Plus the character designs are fantastic, again Ao Kuang is a good example.\n\n[b] Updates are very common! [/b]\n\nEvery 2 Weeks on Tuesday there\u2019s a patch, they are often filled with content ranging from skins, new gods, emotes, gameplay changes, balances and a lot more!\nIt\u2019s fantastic that updates are really common, a lot of companies should follow Hi Rez\u2019s footsteps.\n\n[b] A large community that has guides and builds all over! [/b]\n\nWant to learn how to play Thor like a boss? Well hop online and look what people have put down about him, there are thousands of guides! So learning is just as easy as landing his Ultimate.\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n\n[b] Questionable Matchmaking [/b]\n\nOften you will find yourself in a horribly unbalanced game, the amount of times where I\u2019ve had less experienced players against a full competitive premade team is painful, and it\u2019s very common for this to happen sadly.\n\n[b] Balance [/b]\n\nRight now SMITE is at its most balanced state, but somethings do need changing, like Hunters in general being too strong, and gods like Kukulkan and Anubis getting the middle finger when it comes to getting buffs (Aka they rarely get any)\n\n[b] Events and chests [/b]\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of events recently, while they are fun, they often have exclusive and limited skins, while the exclusive skins will come back in chests later, it\u2019s a pain in the ass to get them sometimes, limited skins however are gone forever, so they are just there to taunt you.\nAlso speaking of chests, there\u2019s too many chest skins, some don\u2019t even deserve to be chest skins, for an example Bun Bun Nox and King of the Sea Poseidon don\u2019t deserve to be in chests, hell I thought King of the Sea was a Tier 2 Skin before I released it had voice lines, it doesn\u2019t even add new effects! What the hell Hi Rez?\n\n[b] The ingame community is toxic [/b]\n\nOutside SMITE everyone is friendly, inside however\u2026 oh boy it\u2019s awful.\nIf you mess up once, and I mean ONCE! People will start taking the piss out of you.\n\nA perfect example from me was in this game of Clash, I was a Sobek, I was behaving highly aggressive and attempting to get as many kills/assists as possible to get my gold up, about mid game I charged for an enemy and killed him, sadly I got killed in the process from his high damage and a finishing blow from a tower, a Rama said I was \u201cDoing horribly\u201d and I stayed silent, thankfully our Nemesis was on my side and saying \u201cHe\u2019s doing better then you\u201d, and at the very end of the match we lost, and I just asked Rama, \u201cHave you even play a hunter before?\u201d As he got less kills and gold then me.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=697836992\n\nSo as you can see, even though I got the most gold which means I did most of the work in the game, there\u2019s always that one guy who will talk shit about you.\n\n[h1] Overall [/h1]\n\nA fantastic 3rd Person MOBA and a lot of fun, just keep calm, do your best, and hopefully I\u2019ll fight you in the battlefield someday.", "timestamp_created": 1472390821, "timestamp_updated": 1511542153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 91, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.814478099346160889", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18428484": {"recommendationid": "18428484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073966026", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 17090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546702959}, "language": "english", "review": "Step 1: Have a break from league of legends \nStep 2: Download Smite\nStep 3: Start playing smite\nStep 4: ,,Why aren't they blaming each other?\"\nStep 5: ,,Oh man, community in this game is just a paradise\"\nStep 6: League of Legends has just uninstalled on its own\nStep 7: Never back to LoL again\nStep 8: Go back to play Smite\nMe 1 year ago\n\n\nI won't miss you LoL\n\n@Edit: I see that a lot of people complain about my hours spent in this game.

It's not meant to jab at the game itself, but the problems I've dealt with the product and its company. My hours are not accurate and I've played before it was on Steam.\n\nThis game has a bug with WIndows 8/8.1/10 where using an older generation CPU like the Lynnfield/Bloomfield processors overclocked (via the FSB, not multiplier) causes your system (Windows TIme) clock to run faster. This in turn also causes syncing issues with games of the Unreal Engine for some bizarre reason. \n\nGames like Rocket League will cause you to d/c from the match. Games like SMITE that also use the same engine? They will cause you to move faster in game, or just outright give you 300-400ms. I got the latter, thankfully not the former or at least that's what I think, rubberbanded a lot, too. I reported this on their feedback page, unaware of the Windows 8/8.1/10 problem because I've been on Windows 7 until three weeks ago.\n\nNonetheless, this problem flags their anticheat, permanently banning you. If you get banned by this system, there's no way out, they don't care, unless you take it to the subreddit and call them out. Unfortunately, /r/Smite now has rules against this type of behavior, so have fun trying to get things addressed with Hirez support. I was banned. My friend is friends with HirezTom and he told him to tell me to send in a support ticket and it'll be resolved, no problem. I was relieved, I thought to myself, hey if this guy is nice about it, I'm sure the support team will also care and try to help me figure out what went wrong.\n\nNo. That's not what happened at all. I left a ticket, sent in various screenshots, unaware of this cpu bug. I verified and proven my Windows 10 install and everything on my PC was fresh, brand new, basically. This leads to me my first problem, I was given a \"eula copypasta\" saying I used software to modify the game, indicating they didn't even bother to read my ticket.\n\nTheir support team will give you a copypasta \"no\" response, guaranteed. Look at their forums, there's a thread with over 5 pages about the Overclock ban and how they all got the same automated response. \n\nThey won't talk to you, they treat you as a robot. They will close your ticket if you re-open it, and if you're persistent about wanting to talk to an actual person, they'll ban your customer support account. It's a known problem with HiRez and I've supported them since the Global Agenda days because I never ran into these issues until I was forced to install Windows 10. I've played this game before playing through the launcher on Steam, hence my low hours.\n\nThe game has gone through subtle changes over the years and I'm sure it'll still be popular. But obviously I can't recommend the game due to their subpar customer support that makes even Steam Support look like a top-notch customer support service.\n\nIt's a slap in the face to not communicate with dissatisfied customers and players of their product.\n\nIf I ever do pick up this game again or any of their games, I probably won't be spending money on any of their microtransactions. I bought stuff like skins because they were nice and it supports the company. I can't support a company I wanted to work for in the past because of how poorly they treated their customers.\n\nIf you have fun in this game, that's great, It's a fun game, nice community compared to Dota and LoL. The product itself isn't bad, it's the people behind the product that makes me not recommend this game.\n\n________________\n\n\nEDIT 2/6/16-2/7/16: Thank you, everyone for liking and upvoting this review so it gets higher on the Community Hub in hopes that a developer or some Hi-Rez staff will see this. \n\nI also use f.lux and that is a program that tampers with my hue lighting to get dimmer as the day goes on, I have eye fatigue and I've used it along with Smite for years without problems.\n\nI wanted to clarify that I am aware that Hi-Rez treats their community very fondly in regards to balancing the game and suggestions to the game. But that's completely different from how they handle bans and how they handle customers who are afraid and anxious from false/questionable bans. They don't re-assure them at all and they make their fears of being permanently banned - a reality by sending them a nonsensical copy and paste \"you broke the eula\" when they want to talk to a representative about why or what happened and how they can resolve the issue. \n\nI shouldn't need to be a famous person, a streamer, or someone \"relevant\" to get unfair advantages in the system. I expect to be treated like a human being, who has been patient, and wants to talk to a representative of the company to resolve technical problems that I've been addressing through their feedback after matches and on the support page. I left that on my support ticket about me leaving constant feedback, screenshots, tons of things about my problems. I was given a \"you used malicious software and broke our eula\" when I've stated and proved that I have a relatively new computer with little to no software besides an antivirus, Smite, and other steam games.\n\nI do have friends that are in contact with Hi-Rez, some work with them and help test Paladins, some are family of workers. Nonetheless, I shouldn't be needing to ask them for favors like \"Can you get someone to actually read my ticket before they send a copy and paste response that is totally irrelevant to my case? I have a fresh Windows 10 install, I can't have any type of malicious software.\" It was from one of my friends who contacted a Hi-Rez employee that I learned about the overclocking bug that can result in a glitched engine or higher ping, not from anyone on the Hi-Rez support page/email. That's saying something. That's saying there's a clear lack of communication between the dissatisfied, upset customer and the customer tech support, whose job is supposed to communicate with people. Still, at the end of the day, the company is there to make profit. Losing me won't equate to anything. But if I equate to nothing, shouldn't that mean that I should be unbanned instead of playing frogger so that my voice can be heard?\n\nI'm a head administrator of a fairly decent sized Garry's Mod server, I'm a Wikia administrator, I've been a forum customer support for Invisionfree. I know how Customer Support works, I've been in three or more positions and I know communication is key for fellow co-workers and clients. This lack of communication from Hi-Rez's customer support needs to be addressed. \n\nDozens of players have been banned by a similar issue like mine. We're not informed of it by customer support, we're left in the dark and we get our answers from google searches because they're apparently more reliable and gives us the answers we want to our questions. Copy and pasting is not helpful. You already have a FAQ, people send tickets because they want an actual person to respond and help them assess their situation.\n\nI stand by my story that my ban was a mistake. Banning because of overclocked cpus and their operating system not working intended on your engine is a fault on Microsoft's and the company. You already have a fix by \"banning players\", but you can always take the Rocket League approach and just disconnect the player or kick them. It'd solve a ton of headaches for the customer support who have to go through these tickets and it'd mean less banned players to be really frustrated that the customer support just wants their paycheck and will find the easiest possible method of \"answering\" people's tickets.\n\n_____________\n\nEdit 2-7-16:\n\nWe've hit 50/50 (100%) ratio, that's rare.

This has the adverse effect of causing the game to run faster. This IS Speed Hacking, as it can be directly used to move faster in the game in the same manner as someone Speed Hacking.\n\nWe have had issues with this in the past, as a problem we identified about a year ago. If you want the full details of this exchange, it is available here : https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/2t2rif/ban_after_hirez_themselves_confirm_an/\n\nSince then, we have had a strict policy on this manner. It is clear from the get-go of Launching the game that the game is running faster. Everything will move faster, animations, transitions, etc. Playing a game under these circumstances will mean a ban. It HAS to be like this, since any leniency give people who want to abuse it a specific setup to go buy that they can then use. In regards to this particular ban, it will not be lifted.\n\nI do feel as if I can address the secondary large concern, which is responsiveness of the Support Staff. As of this Month, we have actually begun planning, developing, and implementing improvements to our internal support tools, the support websites, as well as all of our resources.

Keep in mind the negatives outweight the positives in my opinion, however I STILL LOVE and play this game everyday.\n\nPros:\n       SMITE is a game I have played since season 1. and knew about it in it's beta. and the game mechanics have evolved to suit the current META and season for players.\n      It is completly free to play.

Although steps have been taken recently to improve knowledge amongst new players.\n      Loki is in the game....

The third-person perspective is what initially sparked my interest. I disliked the point and click controls of other MOBAS. In SMITE I feel like I have control over my character and can aim all my abilities freely. In short, if you are looking for something different in the MOBA scene, download SMITE and try it out. Its free so you do not have anything to lose. Also, some people may be turned off because SMITE is a free to play game.

At its current state, Smite is an embarrassment.\n\n[b]Greedy cashgrabbing assholes:[/b] Hi-Rez milked the Smite cow for all of its money by spitting out about 5+ skins with each weekly patch, whereas glaring glitches, bugs and imbalances remained untouched for months. For example, we had an extra Jungle Practice mode, which when clicked on, did nothing. Scrolling with the mouse wheel on the god page hardly ever works. The UI accidentally got skewed and shrunk by default. Nobody bothered to fix all of this shit, but Hi-Rez was quick to release pretty skins instead. The money made from skins is not used to make the game better or even fund the game's eSports scene. Instead, Hi-Rez raised 100.000$ through Smite skin sales for a tournament for their new cashgrab battle royale game, featuring fucking KEEMSTAR!\n\n[b]Balance by 3rd graders:[/b] Some gods are legitimately broken and are not balanced simply because they are popular, aka people get more skins for them. When a really good, super rare skin is released for a god, that god is overtuned and made OP so people have more incentive to buy that very expensive skin for him/her. Other gods are unpopular and so remained untouched by balance changes or skins for more than half a year. The PTS server is either broken or ignored, so broken shit makes it live constantly, then Hi-Rez has to spend 3 patches trying to fix the obvious.\n\n[b]Matchmaking is hot garbage:[/b] More often than not, having played over 1000hr (in-game time), I still get matched with or against people who have played no more than 10% of my own playtime. The matchmaking system is built to force you in a 50% win/loss ratio. As such, if you get very good, you will suddenly have beginner teammates and diamond level enemies, so that you will be forced to lose. If you are losing too much, you will get matched against noobs that you can stomp. Lately, very rarely have I felt that my win or loss was well-earned.\n\n[b]Why I still play:[/b] The game, at its core, is actually pretty awesome. Gameplay is fun, third-person perspective is interesting, most gods are cool and fun to play. I just wish Hi-Rez sold Smite to a company that actually cares.

Smite Fixed all of the that, when you auto attack someone it's not you just clicking on them and the attack auto hitting them no matter what, In Smite it's a skill shot that they can dodge the same principle applies to most abilities.\n\nYou start off with 5 base gods for free + another 5 on rotation.\nYou can buy more gods via in game credits you earn buy playing and leveling up, purchase them with real money individually with gems, or get the ultimate god pack it's $30 and gives you every god in the game as well as every feature god if you plan on playing as lot of smite it's definitely worth it. The community is amazing for a MOBA.\n\nThe main con I can think of is the servers. I live in western US and always have over 100 ping normally 120 ish.\n\nSome tips for new players.\n\nBuy beads! You will hear this, a lot in arena it means you should buy Purification Beads from the store it's a cheap on use item that gives you CC immunity when used.

The number of playable gods have almost doubled from when I started playing, so new content is always available. (Although in my opinion god releases are a little to frequent for my taste).

I remember playing it back in the beta (You know where Ao Kuang actually was a dragon and Nu Wa didn't have fire shards raining down for her ulti), dropped it for a while (mostly due to me not having the same amount of fun nowadays), but here are the pros and cons for this game to the best of my abilities.\n\n[b]PROS:[b]\n\n-Wide selection of gods and goddesses from a plathera of mythologies. You have the standard Greeks and Romans, but also Chinese, Hindu, Mayan, Egyption, Norse, Japanese and now Celtics.\n-3rd person makes you feel like you're in the fight instead of just pointing and clicking.\n-Great with friends.\n-New gods come out fairly recently in between patches, so you aren't waiting a long time for one to pique your interest.\n\n[b]CONS[b]\n\n-Community is always salty, but that should be a given considering it's a MOBA. Just keep your head held up high and stay calm and you should be fine. \n-Matchmaking wasn't the best when I played, sometimes you'd be put into a horrible scenario where the other team just curbstomps yours. \n-Transactions are still there, but it's mostly cosmetic things like skins, announcers, icons for your profile, etc. \n\nThere are many flaws in this game, but I'm not going to list of all of them, I'm fairly sure someone did that already.\n\nOverall do I recommend SMITE? I'd have to say maybe. Depending if you want to try a third person MOBA and can handle the saltiness and matchmaking being completely stupified. But since there's no middle option, I'd say yes, but only if you have friends that you can play with so you're not stuck playing with randoms who may not have an idea of what their doing. \n\nI'd give SMITE a 7/10.

The game has come a long way with all the visual updates and the god balance but the state of the community has just been getting worse every year. But of course, since you can just mute anyone who is fedora-neckbearding in the chat the gameplay doesn't really suffer unless you listen to their crap and let them get at you. In the end though, it's a team game, so you will have to endure some salt one way or the other.\n\nThe gameplay side of Smite is well executed and unique in the MOBA genre. The third person view and the familliarity of the gods to the common person makes the game more accessible in my opinion because not every player is interested in Lore and the bird's view in traditionnal MOBAs can be a barrier for the new player who has yet to pick up a game from the genre.\n\nThe last point that makes this game for me is the cheap god pack, in which you receive every god released as well as all future gods for like 20$USD. This method is far better than that of LoL/HotS, even though it's not nearly as good as the free DOTA 2 way of going.\n\nSmite is at a great point in it's lifecycle for new players to join in, with the recent Steam addition and the game only being in it's second season of competitive/ranked play. \n\nOverall, I would recommend playing Smite or simply giving it a try to see if you'd like it because it's definitely worth a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1442262696, "timestamp_updated": 1449484574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.763185381889343262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18329640": {"recommendationid": "18329640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136341436", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 28700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469736806}, "language": "english", "review": "Each skin released for Apollo has progressively tighter pants.\n\n10/10 would watch the booty go pow", "timestamp_created": 1443980295, "timestamp_updated": 1445101599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 282, "votes_funny": 742, "weighted_vote_score": "0.777582526206970215", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17957782": {"recommendationid": "17957782", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002813461", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 25657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550359902}, "language": "english", "review": "Played 3k+ hours before steam, this game saved my life then ruined it 10/10\n\nedit:but seriously if you can't get into the other MOBA's because of the isometric gameplay Smite is for you.", "timestamp_created": 1441813563, "timestamp_updated": 1442429404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 317, "votes_funny": 183, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768927335739135742", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17985937": {"recommendationid": "17985937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042908106", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 6555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498327291}, "language": "english", "review": "NOTE: I have at least 300-400 hrs Pre-Steam.\nI stopped playing Smite quite a time ago and seeing Smite on Steam really caught me by surprise, and a really nice one too. \nI've got back in, having it on Steam makes is ooo much accessible, and it seems it makes patches easier to install.

In each category I will shortly explain each of the points.\n\n[u] THE VERY GOOD [/u]\n- Very satisfying gameplay. The way you control your god feels very good and can be quite fun, even after many hours. Even though the core elements of a MOBA are still there, it feels like a 3rd person action game, which means it appeals to both fans of the MOBA genre and people who want a cool, fun experience.\n- Interesting representation of ancient gods. For me it is commendable that they managed to present gods from 9 different pantheons (as of now) with a lot of detail, having a somewhat accurate appearance, a lore feature which allows players to read the backrounds of all gods and encourages some of them to look for more details. At the same time, Hi-Rez is not afraid to release skins that are definately not faithful to the mythology, but are meant to be simply cool.\n- Extremely well made sountrack. Even though some of the tracks in Smite are variations of the same theme, they managed to make them in a way to go for a different touch in each version, depending on the pantheon. Still, leaving those aside, the game has a lot of high quality themes that fit the tone of the game and in fact can be appreciated even by outsiders.\n- Outstanding in-game chat. The text chat is nothing special, but the voice chat is really convenient. During Smite matches you can open your voice menu (using the V button) and quickly find different messages like \"Enemies in the right lane\", \"Be right back\" etc that are read for your whole team to hear. Needless to say, this is a great feature that helps speed up the process of communicating with your team.\n\n[u] THE GOOD [/u]\n- Nice visuals and level of graphics. Considering this is a free to play title, from a visual standpoint this game has succeded. The god models look pretty good, the environments have some detail, textures are (almost) always clear and in general it seems satisfying to look at.\n- Good application of the free to play model. This is one the rare occasions where a game that is free to play does not depend on spending either money or insane amounts of grind to compete with other players. In order for you to be competitive, all you need to have is the required skill necessary. That being said, you do depend on your teamates as well, but nevertheless if you are good enough you will at least guarantee that you will do your part sufficiently.\n- Leniency in collecting in-game currrencies. This game uses two types of currency, favor, which is mostly obtained through winning matches and gems, which are mostly obtained through paying real money. There are bonuses for getting those currencies, like free favor/gems for logging in on consecutive days or for completing daily quests. That allows players to collect gods/skins in a shorter period of time without having to play all day. It should also be noted that there is the Ultimate God Pack, a feature that unlocks all current and future gods for around 20-25 euros/dollars (price varies depending on where you live). Although getting every god is not necessary to play the game, having every single one that is out or will be out for that amount of money is a good deal.\n- A variety of game modes. There are 6 different maps (with the corresponding practice and co-op modes), as well as a Match of the Day feature that, as the name suggests, changes every day and is inspired by recommendations of the community. Naturally, there are also 3 ranked modes on these maps (Conquest 5v5, Joust 3v3 and Joust 1v1). The different layout of the lanes, the towers and the camps in those maps means you can alternate between them and reduces fatigue.\n- Well designed watching option. In the \"Wisdom\" tab, you can quickly find current Smite streams or god guides and watch them while the game is running. Granted, you could just open your internet browser and search it there, but it is a neat feature which should be mentioned. Also, the spectating mode is pretty handy.\n\n[u] THE MEH [/u]\n- The community. This is not the worst community in any game (it is FAR from that), but at times the playerbase can get pretty bad. As I mentioned earlier, the game has a voice chat available, which can be spammed a lot when people are upset. This creates issues, since you don't want to listen to pointless messages, but at the same time muting the player completely can cause you to miss important warnings. Not to mention the intentional feeders/leavers/blamers that are matched with you from time to time. Overall, it is better than many games and probably better than most MOBAs out there, but still the room for improval is there.\n- The matchmaking. Sometimes, in order for Smite to find players to match against one another, it has to expand the window of matchmaking between players. Simply put, in normal matches there is a chance you could be matched with players way higher or lower than you in terms of skill. Not only does this make certain matches very unbalanced, but it creates another problem. Punishments for leaving god selections are very severe, because making it more bothersome when people leave in god selection discourages that behavior, thus decreasing the chances of leaving and the time people need to find a game. Unfortunately, when you find teamates in normal games that picked a weird team you don't want to spend time playing with you have to consider staying and potentially wasting your time or leaving and risking at best a big duration as a deserter or at worst a ban. I have even heard that someone got banned once for not clicking accept in time when a match was found.\n- The balancing. In comparison to other competitive games with multiple characters, it is relatively better in that regard, but still, for most of the gods what occurs is going through a period of time of mediocrity, then receiving a buff and becoming pretty strong and then maybe a nerf that brings them back to their original stats (or even lower). I am aware that you can make up for some of the god's weaknesses with a certain level of skill, however when the opponent's skill level matches yours and he/she is using a more viable god you are at a slight disadvantage from the start.\n\n[u] THE BAD [/u]\n- The servers. Servers in Smite have been unstable as long as I can remember them. Lag spikes and disconnects are issues that happen from time to time in games (not very often but on occasion). If I am not mistaken, this issue has been mitigated over the years, but it remains one of the most important ones, as you will get a disconnect from a game because of the servers around once every month.\n\n[u] THE VERY BAD [/u]\n- The recent implementation of Easy Anti Cheat (EAC). EAC is known in the field of gaming to be a big failure of an anti-cheat software. It is riddled with problems, such as not allowing the game to run if you have unsigned drivers, disconnecting players for no reason, banning more innocent players than cheaters (which combined with the irreversible nature of the bans is an awful issue), failure to even stop all cheaters, having properties of actual spyware. Even though the community complained, Hi-Rez included EAC in a recent patch and unsurprisingly, a huge amount of people reporting having trouble with the game since, even though most of them were not cheaters. History proved that EAC was disastrous in other games in which it was implemented (the stories regarding For Honor were even worse) and it was proven very bad in Smite as well.\n\n[b] SUMMARY [/b]\nI was really torn about this decision, because I really, REALLY wanted to recommend Smite, since I've had a lot of fun with this game. However, I decided in the end not to recommend it as the existance of EAC is so menacing that it counteracts all of the advantages Smite has (even though they are greater in number). If EAC is ever removed - highly unlikely - this game would unquestionably be recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1493166777, "timestamp_updated": 1493166777, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 95, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.777498722076416016", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43577347": {"recommendationid": "43577347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216067992", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 267988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2932, "last_played": 1551839783}, "language": "english", "review": "So first of I'd like to begin by saying while my hours in this game are pretty steep compared to most other players; I have only been playing for an entire year and one month at the time of writing this. I've been tossing around the idea of writing a review for this game over a couple months now and today I'm finally deciding to do it.\n\nI've really got to nod Hi-Rez for the Clan System (Pretty much guilds), Simple but effective. This game has given me a chance to meet so of the most wonderful people I've ever experienced but at the same time, never have I experienced a community quite this toxic since LoL (League of Legends) over two years ago. I assume it's still the same but I digress. \nOnly once in my life can I recall being this close to a group of people ever. Winging, Glacy, Stupid Thicc(Now EmperorOppai), Stoopid Thicc(Now TheWildSnapple), Frog, Ezra, Raito Kirigi,  If and I hope you are reading this; Thank you so much for the best year that I've ever experienced so far in my life and I pray that we can continue on like this\n\nNow onto the tough part, BALANCE.\nThis game takes balance to a whole new level, it's pretty topsy turvey if you ask me but anyways; Most of the gods in the game will either feel completely busted or this awkward middle ground like limbo. Most of them just need some fine tuning here and there but others OH BOY don't even get me started. Sadly I don't know how Hi-rez functions as a company when it comes to SMITE and things in it like balance and skins; However, I can say that I've always felt like there was some sort of personal biased towards certain gods such as Bacchus, and Cupid; then a different biased to other gods such as Zhong Kui, and Kumbahkarna. This can be negligence or just pure infautation with these gods, this is for you to determine cause I see both sides personally.\n\nRanked is a clown fiesta, no matter where you go you see the same gods all the time no matter the amount of nerfing that goes into a go for example Cu Chuliann has been nerfed after nerfed and yet it still remains at the top of the warriors, on the other hand there is certain gods who haven't seen pro level play within years such as Aphrodite but yet as soon as she \nrises in popularity she is nerfed. For as long as I've been playing you will see the same gods in the ban list and see the same gods in lane; You'll see Thoth Mid, Cherobog Adc, Ganesha Support, Cu Chuliann Solo, and Thor Jungle then the enemy team trying to find some way of combatting those gods. Very rarely will you see the god meta change; Items decide who is the strongest for the majority of the gods but there are some buffs that completely throw the god off the handle such as Ullr.\n\nHi-Rez as a company has made some \"questionable\" choices since I've started playing SMITE and most of the reviews you'll read about this game are pretty much this \"Great Game, Terrible Company\" Now while I'm not defending Hi-Rez I'm certainly not throwing them completely under the bus; All I can really say for this is give the game a shot despite what you are reading currently. This game has the infamous \"loot box\" system where certain (Now pretty much everything) is locked behind a randomize paywall forcing you to take a chance on something you'd want; Yes we all know skins are not required to play the game but when there is something that you'd pay money for and it's locked behind a roulette, that's really freaking frustrating. Hi-Rez has even gone as far as to buff a god to sell a skin; please keep in mind that this god was generally seen as strong on all levels of play be it bronze or masters. So as I've said before very shady business practices but I'm sure they are all wonderful people and this is just one persons slip-up or something to that effect.\n\nHi-Rez has also made so very poor legal decisions and when I say legal desicisons I mean how they work with they're employee's; One case that has happened very recently is Youtuber Mythymoo and PunkDuck hosted a patch review show that was usually no longer then like 4 minutes but Mythymoo had created a video called \"Four years later\" in which he states that he wouldn't recommend SMITE as a game to anyone so Hi-Rez said they wouldn't renew his contract so he was forced to quit. Obviously I can't speak for him but all I know is what he being Mythymoo has made public via Twitter or his own Youtube account. PunkDuck still does the patch notes review but now by himself so as I've stated before take of that of what you will.", "timestamp_created": 1531797317, "timestamp_updated": 1531798203, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 88, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.740007221698760986", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19885992": {"recommendationid": "19885992", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117872597", "num_games_owned": 576, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 28387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484772682}, "language": "english", "review": "Smite is MOBA game that let you play as gods in another perspective.

Hi-Rez as a company has made it pretty clear through their business practices that they care far more about making money than they do making an enjoyable/balanced game. Before I state what's bad about the game I'll talk about the very few things that are good.\n\nGood:\n\nThe game uses the fairly standard at this point paying for Characters pay model with cosmetic optional purchases. The game offers a wonderful \"God Pack\" for $30 which includes all the gameplay relevant content as a single one-time purchase, this is great and if you can't have have everything free like Valve's F2P games or have the process of unlocking characters a core part of the game like Warframe than this is a great way to do it.\n\nThe general gameplay is quite fun, the game has a stupid pride of stating that everything is a skill shot but honestly that's a load of bull. Yes you have to land your basic attacks, but a large majority of the \"skill shots\" in this game have massive targeters and are stupid easy to hit. I'm not talking about the balance of the game's Gods/Items, I'm talking purely at a fundamental level, I think the gameplay of Smite is fun.\n\nMythology is a key feature of Smite, I absolutely love seeing all these different mythologies mixed together, especially Norse, Chinese and Shinto. I don't always like Hi-Rez's depictions of these Gods and Goddesses but still it's cool and was the main reason I gave the game a shot.\n\nBad: \n\nExclusives/Limited Content is all over the place in this game, if you're new to the game, good luck finding any skins that aren't Exclusive or Limited. Again this content is entirely cosmetic and has no effect on the gameplay, but the amount of time Updates are devoted almost entirely on skins is insane especially considering most of it is incredibly overpriced, requires you purchasing multiple other things you don't actually want or locked behind RNG chest. Yes Smite relies heavily on F2P Lootboxes, more than 60% of the Skins currently in Smite are locked behind lootboxes.\n\nEDIT: I wanted to add on to what I said above about updates devoting time to the skins. The game is INSANELY buggy, par for the course for MOBAs with so many moving parts. The problem is how even the smallest of bugs go unfixed for months and even larger ones STILL aren't fixed after years. These bugs range from tiny UI glitches to gamebreaking. They almost never spend enough time fixing these problems, instead focusing on selling you skins cause fixing the game isn't as sexy as another Exclusive/Limited Nu Wa or Neith skin.\n\nHi-Rez as a company are honestly incredibly disrespectful, many of their employees are active on Twitter, Reddit, etc and will openly mock the players for suggestions and criticism. One of their former employees, left the company after the community was outraged by their statement about suicide and depression. Now I'm not saying the company as a whole is terrible, there's probably plenty of great people working on this game, it's just a lot of the time they've come off as extremely unprofessional.\n\nGame balance is a mess, Hi-Rez relies mostly on \"data\" when balancing the game. The game has multiple modes, with Arena being the most popular, but Conquest being the standard 3-lane \"MOBA\" mode which is the one the game balances around. Win rates of Gods is far more important than how they're performing in the Competitive Pro scene. Some Gods are absolutely garbage in Pro, but annoying/unfun in casual play.\n\nAnyways I'm ranting on about personal gripes with the game at this point. So no I don't recommend Smite, there are much better games out there to spend your time and money on.
