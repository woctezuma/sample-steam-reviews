Glad management finally decided to accept Loadouts fate, and laid off the top 12 devs related to Loadouts creation and on going opperation.\nIt is a sign of dire finacial crisis within Edge of Reality (the games dev company), and with any luck the game will cease to exist within the year ( PC servers will be on the chopping block first no doubt).\nThe games development was derailed by a desperate cash grab and push for a gimmicky PVE mode / PS4 port which began around June 2014. This was a knee jerk responce to a rushed and failed PC launch that happened early Jan of 2014. Nearly 30k players dissapearing from game servers within the first 3 months ( servers that could barley handle the player influx from the very start). Development for features on the PC suddenly became non existant with all focus being put on the creation of the new mode and port. The original PC community was abandoned and for nearly 6+ months the game saw no content updates ( the PC game actually STILL has not been updated). Then only weeks after the luanch of the PS4 port and PVE game mode in January of 2015, the games creative director leaves the team, and within half a month of that, 12 of the games dev team are laid off by management.\nNeedless to say the PS4's playerbase and cash intake are nearly par with that of the failing PC counterpart.\nLoadout, a game that always had scummy intentions with its development, always had a focus on over priced micro transaction cash shop cosmetics over actual core gameplay mechanics (Mardi Gras update) . Clearly the game was marketed toward people with more money then brains, with Loadouts dev team constantly asking its community to \"lower your standards and expectations of Loadout\".\nLower standards indeed. \nNot to mention the flat out lies by the games developers on the intentions and directions of the game. A game which at first was described to \"borrow elements and compeitive focus of titles such as League of Legends\", suddenly became \"a game that never had competitve intentions\" and even to go as far as becoming a PVE focused game. Even the game's engine, which was claimed to be an original creation, was in fact purchsed from SquareEnix as an early build of an unfinished Contra reboot ( notice Axl looks allot like the main char from Contra...)\nA game that was intended to focus around creating billions of unique weapons, a weapon crafting system that was the only thing in the game helping to differentiate it as a unique title on the gaming market, the development of said system was the lowest priority task by the game's lead designer.\nThe game was always putting the cart before the horse and frankly its awsome to see the game getting what it deserves with the loss of the game's core development team.\nTheres a few people out there who may be familair with who I was in the Loadout community and for those out there reading this, \"welp I told ya so\". There may have been a grain of salt to all my salt afterall.\nIf there ever was a handbook on how NOT to develop a competitive online PVP game it would have to be titled, \"Loadout\".\"\nthere ya have it\ngames dead\nRIP fam", "timestamp_created": 1495680916, "timestamp_updated": 1495680916, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.743169009685516357", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45282230": {"recommendationid": "45282230", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166854782", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427275768}, "language": "english", "review": "#ReviveLoadout", "timestamp_created": 1539614788, "timestamp_updated": 1539614788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.658286750316619873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47936312": {"recommendationid": "47936312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084678293", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 3026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463177903}, "language": "english", "review": "back then all of my friends where playing this.\n\nwas a REALLY fun game ... good memories :)", "timestamp_created": 1546116203, "timestamp_updated": 1546116203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670218884944915771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28578917": {"recommendationid": "28578917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014466812", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430778936}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was a hell of a lot of fun when i started playing it.

I only spent a few hours on steam, but I've spent more than 50 hours on the ps4 version. I decided to jump back into the PC version and now I have a verdict on this version.\n\nLoadout is a very unique F2P shooter. You have the ability to create different combinations of weapons and use them to blow up or dismember your opponents. You have a lot of options and every combination is fun to create and fun to use in  combat. \n\nThe game also had a very smart approach to Free to play. The game allowed you to use the money for gun parts which didn't make the gun over powered. \n\nThe player base is currently still alive and kicking and you can jump into any game mode without any trouble.\n\nAll the game modes are incredibly fun, so if you get sick of one game mode you can quickly jump into another without a problem.\n\nYou might be asking yourself, why I'm giving this game a negative review then if all the things that I listed make the game seem awesome. Well the reality is the PC version is terrible compared to the PS4 version.\n\nThe game has been abandoned by the developers, who announced that the servers will shutdown and not to mention no updates for a while now.\n\nSome connection issues also ruin the fun of the game, but that rarely happens so I doubt you will run into that problem.\n\nIn the end this game is incredibly fun, but the devs abandoned the game, so there is next to no reason to play the PC version. If you have a PS4 that is the place to play the superior version of the game.\n\nFinal Rating:\n4/10 - Don't bother with the PC version\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you dislike post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_created": 1449596193, "timestamp_updated": 1454102617, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 123, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.787846803665161133", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29799778": {"recommendationid": "29799778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063725468", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 2451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425911400}, "language": "english", "review": "this game has been dead for over 2 years now", "timestamp_created": 1486641261, "timestamp_updated": 1486641261, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705070257186889648", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37461748": {"recommendationid": "37461748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159889238", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1537628783}, "language": "english", "review": "Dead or dying, let's revive this awesome game!", "timestamp_created": 1511584816, "timestamp_updated": 1511584816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.693316876888275146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32650379": {"recommendationid": "32650379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118973098", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1541687543}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good game but\n\nIt's no longer updated....\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1498162878, "timestamp_updated": 1498162878, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696061134338378906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48163344": {"recommendationid": "48163344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049097311", "num_games_owned": 482, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463874370}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly a great game.

You may still play it but don't spend any cash on it.\n\nI bought Steam Launch Starter Pack in June 2014. I played the game a bit and I loved it but I removed it shortly after that. So a few days ago I decided to give it a try again. I bought Blutes and XP boosts and I tried to play the game again. I thought people still play Loadout. Boy, was I wrong.\n\nTurns out the game was almost completely abandoned. It used to have about 30\u00a0000 people playing it at the same time, now this number is closer to 500. I have a feeling most of them randomly found Loadout on Steam Store, saw it's free and decided to play it a bit. Casual matchmaking is still possible \u2014 just select European or American servers depending on time of a day.\n\nMoreover the game was abandoned by its developers. It used to get updates almost every week. Now they won't even add PvE mode (PS4 received it almost right after launch in January 2015). After PS4 launch Loadout's creative director left the development team. Shortly after that 12 people working on Loadout were fired and the game does not receive any more content.\n\nSo don't do the same mistake as I did: do not invest money in this game, it's dead. Feel free to try it. It's sad actually, the game itself is pretty decent. I have a feeling Edge of Reality is going to keep servers running until they can cover expenses.

Usually in under a minute you're on the battlefield (EU servers) and you can find matches even at 6 in the morning\n\n-you build your weapons yourself from a large collection of gun parts, so you can create weapons that fit your game style (e.g. one-shot sniper weapons with slow fire rate, or a gatling gun that rapidly sets your enemies on fire, or a rocket launcher whose rockets \"crawl\" along the ground, or a mine thrower to set up traps for the enemy...)\n\n-funny over-the top violent graphics (especially the death animations), and pretty explicit taunts (fat women with half of their face off taunting your by twerking, naked guys who dangle their genitals, or a Rocky Balboa guy doing a pole dance, etc etc)\n\n-you earn XP and in-game currency while playing, so you can unlock and buy more gun parts (e.g. healing ammo, bigger magazines, remote-controlled rockets) and equipment items (such as turrets, hand grenades, spawn points, deployable health packs) the longer you play. Mostly play-to-win (but only mostly, see below).\n\n-It is just  a hell lot of fun to play!\n\n\nThe bad:\n\n-if you've been playing 1st person shooters, then you will painfully notice that 3rd person shooters just offer a LOT less precision than 1st person shooters (because your 3rd person character can't stop moving in the middle of a step - so you can only move in \"step\" units across the map. In a game where precise movement is key, this is a big disadvantage (even though the devs do their best to hide this problem).\n\n-if you've played serious arena shooters, you will at certain moments be annoyed by the graphics, because an overkill of on-screen effect overlays often times makes careful aiming impossible. If one enemy uses fire ammo, and another player shoots a healing rocket in the same area, you will just have red fire, blue tesla balls and green health goo all over your screen and won't be able to see the actual terrain, or the players you are trying to kill.\n\n-some completely retarded designer thought that it would be a good idea that players have to press the shift key to run (instead of having run be the default and pressing shift to walk slow and sneaky). This has the effect that the ENTIRE time you play the game, you have to hold down shift!!! (because you want to the running around *all* the time, with some very few exceptions in \"capture the hammer\" mode).\n\n-Most items sold for money in the store are only cosmetic, plus you can buy a booster pack that increases the rate at which your earn XP and in-game currency. BUT there are some important exceptions: Your character can carry TWO GUNS AND ONE EQUIPMENT ITEM (jump boots/hand grenades/turret/...). Such a combination is called a \"Loadout\". Every time you respawn after dying, you can choose which loadout you want to use. After playing a while, you will have quite a number of different guns and equipment items - but free players can have only a limited number of guns, and more importantly ONLY 3 LOADOUTS (ie gun+equipment combinations). So if you do not buy additional loadout slots for real money, you are at a bit of a disadvantage, since you can't use the right gun and item combinations. For instance, if your enemy has a really good sniper and has secured the base with turrets, you will need yourself a good sniper weapon to have a chance to get close, plus maybe the disguise equipment item (so turrets won't recognize you as an enemy, allowing you to just run past unharmed). If you are a paid player, you will have the right combination (sniper, plus close-range weapon, plus disguise) in one of your loadouts. If you are a free player with only three possible combinations, chances are you won't... Having said that, skill, strategy and good teamplay (especially a good healer) are definitely more important factors for whether your team will win.", "timestamp_created": 1414504866, "timestamp_updated": 1428057087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 205, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.793819844722747803", "comment_count": 30, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 31, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 16754, "total_negative": 3198, "total_reviews": 19952}}
