This happens to be one of the worst Valve games I've ever played. This Half-Life mod is just the same as every other but somehow the worst.\n\n\n\nSo the controls are the same as the others. The framerate is okay, it lags abit. The maps are alright. The recoil is awful, jesus christ. The worst thing of this game is the players, they all cheat, I don't know how the VAC doesn't detect it. People were flying around the map, noclipping through walls. And also they were on god mode, I couldn't figure out how to do the same. I bet if I did it, I'd get a VAC ban. I wouldn't like that.\n\n\n\nThe other worst thing is the fact everybody playing the game is a jerk. I don't like that everybody there calls you retarded and stuff. Some really offensive words have been used in the server I was in. It isn't a good game.\n\n\n\nThe game map that I was in was the same one from QUAKE. The guns on the middle and bottom of the screen reminds me of almost every Doom/Quake/Wolfenstein clone. Other than that, the gameplay is completely fine, graphics are what you'd expect from a game from its time, it came out 2001. Graphics were getting better in 2001, like Silent Hill 2, it has amazing graphics for the time, but Deathmatch Source and every Valve game from 2001 and under is not that great but it's still alright for the time the game was released.\n\n\n\nI've only gotten into 1 server in this game, hopefully it grows in popularity but it's old, so that's that. Anyway, lets get to the final score.\n\n\n\nFinal score: 43%\n\n\n\nThis game sucks, it's awful, it may be a classic to people but I honestly don't think so. If you're into these awful multiplayer FPS games, you do you, buddy. But I'm not into these kinds of games.\n\n\n\nThank you for reading my review and hopefully you liked it.

The last DMC server on earth. With last two players.\nThey were fighting to win. One versus one. Head to head.\nThey were winning their own small victories. Their score was close, they were the best.\nAnd after playing for so long they grew attached to each other.\nThe player one really started to like player two, but he didn't know how to express his feelings.\nAfter 3 kills in the row, player one decided to write a message in chat: \"Hey, you're a really good player!\"\nTo which he recived no answer. He waited. He though to himself - \"Maybe player two dosen't know how to use the chat... or maybe they didn't see it, or or they migh not want to reply?\" The player one felt empty. He never got an answer from his opponent which he liked so much.\nSo he just though \"I'm just gonna play and beat the player two (the player two was 3 frags ahead.) and then we'll see if he wants to talk to me...\"\nAfter hours of fragging the player one was really attached to played two, infact he loved him. But after a while player one though \"Thats it! I have been playing for too long, I should go get some food.\" Before leaving he though \"I'll just add player two into my friends list, maybe we will be able to play together later.\"\nBut then the unpredicted happened.\nHe was about to add player two to his friends list, but he couldn't find him. Not on \"currently playing with\" nor in steam community search box. But then he realisted the reason the player two didn't respond, the reason he could not find him anywhere. The reason was that the player two was actually a bot. A simple AI creature made by server owner to keep the server alive.\nThe player one was shattered into pieces. The person he loved, the person he was so attached to. It was only a bot. A soulless creature that had one goal \u2500 kill.\nHe left the server in anger and uninstalled DMC.\nSo there it was the last DMC player had left the game.

I remeber the first time I ever played this game, it was August of 2004 on a  tuesday. My wife had just left me. After I had lost my job my wife said that she couldn't love a failure so she ran off to another state and took the children with her. I felt I needed an escape from the sheer pain of my situation. I thought that going to my local bar would help drown my sorrows. As I stepped into the building, the bar tender, Big John Joe ( I have no idea if that was his real name) noticed my dower state and asked how the situation was going. I told him it wasn't going well, that I didn't have enough money to sue for custody and that I was considering suicide. Worried, he told me of a way possibly make some quick cash. He told me about this game called DeathMatch classic. He said that with enough practice I could get good enough to win prize money from tournamets and maybe even get a sponsorship. So thats what I did, I played for months. Day in and day out, I would play DeathMatch classic until I got good enough to get into tournaments. I played fairly well, getting fourth place. I did even better during my next locals placing second and then eventually first. It was strange I had gotten fairly good so quickly, it was almost like DeathMatch classic and I were connected in some way. Anyway, I got sponsored by Sprite, their rep told me that \"I knew all the tricks.\" With the sponsorship along with the tournament prize money, I was able to sue for custody and have a chance at getting my children back. It was long and painful court battle, but eventually I won. The victory was even more amazing than any game of DeathMatch classic.

Including remade versions of Quake 1's various weapons, such as the nailgun, super shotgun and rocket launcher. It uses a lot of Half-life's assets like multiplayer models, textures and sprites. And at the same time attempts to mimic Quake's physics. Allowing players to also bunnyhop and strafejump. They also remade several of Quake 1's deathmatch maps and included them with the game.\n\nNow all of this was great. Although Deathmatch Classic released at around the same time as Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament. As a result the community didn't really gravitate towards it as much as Valve would have liked, seeing it as a little outdated and more of a novelty.  \n\nPlaying it today you can see some general upsides to Deathmatch Classic. It uses Steam's server browser and has mods for bots. So it is rather easy to setup a game of classic Quake deathmatch with someone online.

The playerbase totally is around 70 players in the world.\nthe graphics were 50/50 for 2001 game i liked lighting alot but Quake III engine had alot better lighting,shading and even some textures were more detailed, and texture compression.\nDMC has it\u00b4s pluses against Quake games that it doesn\u00b4t have problems with drivers and runs smoothly on Windows 10.\nSince my internet isn\u00b4t very good i liked alot that lag compensation is alot Better actually than other game engines. The game already has antialiasing and texture filtering, that means alot of objects are less pixelated against other quake games. The game has better server browser and you will find easily and quickly alot of server.
