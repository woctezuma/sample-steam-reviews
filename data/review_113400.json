This game is focused on PvP, but it is the shittiest unbalanced mess. Weapons are not permanent and cost a lot, if someone has a better weapon than you, you can't do anything. It is simply unbalanced, pay to win and toxic piece of shit. You gotta spend some real dough to enjoy this game. Sure, customization hella awesome, but i couldn't get the items i wanted, because the game wanted me to invest hours in this piece of crap. It is always a real shame to see a game turned into a hunk of mess like this. I tried. I really tried. I gave it my best to play another 2-3 hours with my friend, but i couldn't do it. The community is one of the most toxic ones. 10 minutes into the game and i get called \"hacking russian faggot\". I am not even Russian and that should say a lot. If the developers cared at least a little bit about this game, they wouldn't make more \"content\", they would fix the fucking game. When they first announced this game, they said it was going to be awesome. This game went through development hell and came back stable. I respect that. But that doesn't mean it is a good game. Hell, it's not even an ok game. So, what I am saying is, if you are already playing this game, go ahead and keep playing. But if you are starting fresh, don't even waste your hours playing this.

We started as a small game developer in 2003, and in the last 8 years we have grown into a small retail publisher. We are not a big studio, and trust me, you wont find any of our previous titles impressive. But over the last year, we have started taking steps to transition into the publisher we want to be.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of speculation over the last couple months about who would be crazy enough to take on this game. And I\u2019m not going to try and sugarcoat it, we know that the confidence in this game is at an all time low, and odds are you haven\u2019t heard of us at Little Orbit. But that\u2019s OK. There\u2019s a lot of work to do, and I\u2019m not writing this letter to make unrealistic promises or layout a grand roadmap. Instead, I\u2019m going to ask for your patience as we get organized and that you give us a chance to show you that we are sincere in our efforts to make APB Reloaded the game we all know it can be.\n\nI will however make one simple commitment right now. From here on out, I promise to communicate with the community on a regular basis. No more silence. Good, bad or ugly I will share where we are at.\n\nMoving forward there are a number of areas that we need to address for the long term health of this game. Some of them are sexy like new content for the game, and some are just operational changes to how the game is run that I feel need to be made.\n\nIn the next 30 days, expect to see GDPR updates for GamersFirst including new privacy policies, code of conduct, and term & conditions. We will also be cleaning up the social pages, implementing a new forum, showcasing a general roadmap for the game and announcing a significant change to our banning and cheating policies.\n\nThis is all critical for setting up an environment where you can give us feedback.\n\nAfter that we\u2019re going to focus on content. I\u2019ll be working on an exact roadmap that we can publish soon, but over the coming months we would like to add a new mode, maps, clothes, guns, vehicles and a new matching system for competitive play. Alongside all of that we are committed to upgrading APB Reloaded to the Unreal 4 engine. This is a long process that involves a massive rewrite of several core systems and a lot of art migration. I know that this has been talked about extensively in the past, and it has been a sore point with the community for a while. It\u2019s going to take time. We need to start by unifying the PC version on Unreal 3.5, and then moving to Unreal 4. Personally I don\u2019t think Unreal 4 is going to have a big impact on the look or speed of the game. It may not even be noticeable to some. But for APB Reloaded to have long-term viability, transitioning to Unreal 4 is something we need to do.\n\nTaken from Update Notes and I am not a dev i am just trying to spread the message.", "timestamp_created": 1527256128, "timestamp_updated": 1528066952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 190, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.902327299118041992", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33539464": {"recommendationid": "33539464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331314318", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1530033222}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is good.\n\nThe devs are bad.\n\nThe community is bad.\n\nThe \"micro\" transactions are really expensive.\n\nThe devs are deleting posts on the forums about DDoS attacks.\n\nWell done.", "timestamp_created": 1500049978, "timestamp_updated": 1500049978, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 193, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.903799116611480713", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "41982534": {"recommendationid": "41982534", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152193086", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1528763053}, "language": "english", "review": "everybody should install or re-install to prove the new owner of the game that we are here and waiting for an update", "timestamp_created": 1526059804, "timestamp_updated": 1526059804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 294, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.893003165721893311", "comment_count": 32, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30402512": {"recommendationid": "30402512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002244835", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 82139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550287135}, "language": "english", "review": "As a veteran of this game since 2012, I think I know quite a lot about APB: Reloaded.

EVERYTHING on the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665in marketplace is overpriced. Admitedly they ARE cool though. It gets quite annoying when the last 15 updates in a row have been simply paid 40$ reskins of guns.\n\n- Corrupt developers. Proof :\n\nTiggs falsebanning people for making fun of her ( Read below )\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/M05rL \n\n\n- \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 optimization, however most mid- high spec computers wont have problems ONLY because this game is old.. no other reason. the code is an absoulute disaster.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrJ0qw3mDDc\n\n- No updates\n\n- Graphics have progressively gotten worse since 2010. They were a bit outdated in 2010, and here we are; 5 years later with even worse graphics then the outdated 2010 ones...\n\n- The most amature developers who break something while trying to fix another\n\n- No events. The few \" events \" are absoulute crap and I wouldn't even consider them to be events.\n\n- Zero clientside Anticheat and only a shitty serverside anticheat. Fairfight is shit in this game compared to something like Fairfight on Battlefield. They can't even detect macros or keystrokes. I am not lying, all it takes is turning on constant delays and boom, all triggerbots and macro users are banned. There are users who have used macros for thousands of hours without bans. There are blatant aimbotters doing 180 degree snaps and never missing such as JanelleStargent who has currently been aimbotting since rank 9 and is now rank 200 for 3+ weeks. The best part? There was LITERALLY an admin in the same match with her who has BANNING priveleges and says \" let Fairfight take care of it \" but keep in mind, he even ADMIT she was cheating and knew for a fact, but still did not ban her. If there are blatant cheaters, they usally last 1-2 weeks and just reroll, there is no clientside anticheat so cheaters will NEVER be detected and instantly banned, people who make an effort to hide their cheats will NEVER get banned either, and if they do, it would have been a false ban regardless ( Read down below )\n\n- They ban legit players and not cheaters proof : https://ffbans.org/Jericho/HelJA\n\nHeIJA - Absolutely nothing fishy with him, played for 5+ years, regular aiming, gets flanked hundreds of times, very good gamesense, records THOUSANDS of hours of him playing on his Youtube and streams hundreds of hours : Nobody thought they were EVER cheating - Banned\n\nDogfish - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI5cXl3yvIk Everything fishy with him, locking onto enemies behind walls, inside cars, never missing, tracking thru walls, 180 degree snaps, known cheater to the community for years- Unbanned\n\nIt is worth noting all these bans are manual, and that there was a user in social district ( impossible to cheat on ) who made fun of Tiggs ( Game Moderator ) and got banned minutes later, and this guy was TRASH at the game.\n\nServers- Sometimes laggy and crash. They had no DDoS Protection before and it was nothing short from nightmare. Every 15 minutes, the server would get DDoS'ed and crash. Absoulutly unplayable. Now, they have fixed it but we still deal with occasional lagspikes and crashes. It isn't too bad, but it's very bad when you take into consideration the average HDD user takes 4-5 minutes to load APB and get into district. \n\n- The game is dead\n\n- Grindy as \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 after level 160\n\n- They can't properly balance guns even though the balance is OKAY\n\n- Too many broken promises. Been waiting for over 3 and a half years for an \" engine \" update and console release.. Let me break it to you.. this wont come around for ATLEAST another 12 months. Who knows where this game will be in 12 months? The community doesn't know for sure since we rely on G1 to tell us, and the truth is G1 has gotten their heads so far up their \u2665\u2665\u2665 to even tell for themselves. Everything they'ved promised us has been broken. Hey G1 remeber about that racing district? LOL\n\n- G1's infamous money making startegy - Make an OP Gun and wait 8 months to nerf it after you made the big bucks. Then, a couple months down the road have a fair balanced game ( gun balance wise ) what it should have been in the beginning, but then you nerf the DECENT in game cash guns, and release an OP Armas real life cash gun. Rinse repeat rinse repeat etc\nIf that doesn't work, ban players off your shitty dying game and hope they spend money\n\nThe pros : \n\n- The gameplay is admitedly fun. I like the mission objectives even though they are 90% of the time unbalanced, random, casual, and EXTREMELY repetitive.\n\n- Customization. So hard to explain how good this is.\n\n- Is not pay2win. I'm a bit skeptical about it since itt's grindy as hell, and I feel like theyre sorta leaning towards that direction since they have been releasing exclusive guns but it isn't that much of a big deal since theres only about 10 of them and the rest are reskins and they're not OP Other then the troublemaker which has been nerfed AFTER 8 MONTHS.\nIn my book, a game is pay2win if they offer you guns that aren't avaible with in game currency, but honestly this is an exception. this game is not pay2win. \n\nOverall this game is like a 4/10: \nIf it wasn't free, had bad customization, this game would easily be a 2/10.\nONLY Play this game if you yourself are a hacker looking for an easy game to hack or are willingly putting yourself up for a stroke. There is nothing good in this game other then the customization, which even if youre an artistic person, Please don't do it PLEASE. You'll be much happier drawing then putting up with the endless, frustrating grind to unlock decent customization without emptying your wallet. By emptying your wallet, I don't mean 20$, I mean 300-400$ \nIf you are into Crime games or Crim vs Cops, go for GTA 5, that game is actually worth your money and time.\n\nI got banned for week because I POLITELY asked a GM twice if nudity symbols were allowed. The first time he ignored me, so I asked again and then he banned me saying he was going to give me time to think about spaming next time. He's very professional indeed; what makes him even better at his job is the fact that he was playing with a blatant aimbotting Shaw on his team ( 180 degrees snaps, never missing, 20-0 on his first game on that account ) and admit he knew he was 100% cheating, however told us to let FairFight handle it, and yet here we are 3 weeks later and he is still aimbotting unbanned ( name is JanelleStargent )", "timestamp_created": 1489033269, "timestamp_updated": 1493087980, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 108, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.865203678607940674", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32131047": {"recommendationid": "32131047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049321252", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 109696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548306426}, "language": "english", "review": "I would have recommended this...

More before I used steam version too, Been playing since 2011. \n\nSo I got into this game because I love the customization and gameplay... Absolutely LOVE it, even though when I started I was mostly a bronze playing on a toaster PC. When I got a new computer I got better and became well borderline silver / gold, jumping back and forth between those two threats. I spent around $1500 USD on the content of this game over the last 5 years and had 33 characters on one account that I put my heart and soul into.\n\nYesterday however during a game I was kicked from a server with 6 seconds left to win the match, low and behold I was kicked by the FairFight \"anti - cheat\" program... Was I cheating? Absolutly not. Anyway, I sent a ticket to G1 - No Response.\n\nWhat now? I'll just sit around and complain about it, or I can express myself about this game. FairFight is broken, it gives false positives, this is confirmed, friends know I don't use cheat programs to gain unfair advantage. PunkBuster was removed from the game because that had issues too... The game engine is old and they \"plan\" to upgrade it? Will they IDK? Truth is I want my money back, or atleast my account.\n\nI do reccomend this game if you...\n\n1. Want to hear people spamming retarded music on mic.\n2. Want to be bullied and harrassed by new and old players almost constantly\n3. Want to play a game with almost no support or moderation\n4. Want to be banned for no reason (I have had many friends get banned in APB for stupid pointless stuff, while blatent cheaters, verbal abusers, people who are constantly racist continue to roam ammock in this game)\n\nSome notes. This game has threat level system that doesn't work too (Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold) Now problem with this is, in the games current setup, theres threat segregation and it makes no sense because golds get stuck in one server and can't play in the majority of other servers with the majority of other players. This leads to gold threats \"dethreating\" to play in the lower tier servers. This means a Gold purposly losing games to become Silver. There's a few reasons why people do this, I won't explain. Try the game if you want to find out. Hell it's free to play and it's not pay to win, but it's very difficult and grindy.\n\nGamersfirst, please care about your players... They are what made you.

Let me just say that I am posting my review of this game as someone who has not been banned and has seen every side of the game and community.\n\nThe game is akin to cocaine, if I'm completely honest. At first it's great, but the more you do it the worse it gets and while you know you really should just fucking stop you can't.\n\nSome pros of the game include the customization, which is without a doubt top notch - you really don't get much better than the customization they offer. The PVP aspect of it is, over all, fairly entertaining and really quite fun. But that's about where the pros stop.\n\nThe cons include an unbalanced threat system to determine matches, micro-transactions (that really aren't all that micro) to get any kind of good customization, cars, weapons, etc., unresponsive devs & GMs (who are inconsistent and biased at best), a hitbox that is the same on the tallest/fattest character as it is on the shortest/skinniest one, an anti-cheat system that is easy to bypass and isn't consistent, and an overall toxic community that honestly reminds me of COD and their never ending comments about what they did to someone's mom last night.\n\nAs much as I hate it I will keep playing it. I honestly don't understand why. I hate the game, I hate the community, and yet at the same time I hold out that hope that one day G1 will be worth a fuck and actually fix the damn thing.\n\nTL;DR: if you're not already playing the game, don't.", "timestamp_created": 1462914052, "timestamp_updated": 1477702802, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 128, "votes_funny": 28, "weighted_vote_score": "0.864425778388977051", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31870530": {"recommendationid": "31870530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056538811", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484100176}, "language": "english", "review": "Edit:\nAPB has been taken from G1 hands.

I played for hours putting my hard earned cash and time into this game. I kept a positive attitude when most players around me were toxic as hell. I tried to make a difference by running a clan, I sought out the friendly players from the toxic masses. I promoted and streamed the game. Hell, at one point I even defended Gamersfirst staff for the hard work they do in dealing with such a feral community. I was blinded for my love of the game and have since been harshly woken up from my rose tinted daydreams.\n\nGamersfirst are crooks. Maybe not quite thieves but definitely crooks. Their company is a vampire, which exploits people's loyalty to the game to suck as much money from their wallets as possible. Countless promises and years of waiting for the fabled engine update which would miraculously fix all of the issues with the games and bring all of its previous player base back to the game. The carrot on the stick which still has yet to be delivered. Yet there are plenty of loot boxes to be had, every month on the dot, another gambling mechanic to draw yet more money from its player base.\n\nI previously praised the customisation as being second to none this is of course if you are willing to spend some money on the game. You are incredibly limited to how much detail you can put in while customising unless you pay for a monthly subscription. But that's just to be able to design your clothing to a level that would make you look truly unique and not like your everyday free to play player. Even purchasing basic cosmetics to make your character look better than anything you could come up with in free clothing will cost you the price of a new game on steam.\n\nWeapons that you buy with in game currency expire after so many hours of gameplay meaning unless you pay $60, per weapon, for a permanent version you will be constantly grinding for cash just to be able to supply yourself with weapons before you can even think about upgrading your vehicle or buying new clothing.\n\nNot only this but there are weapons that can only be bought for real world currency that are better than what you can acquire for free. Often bundled in bigger more expensive packs of items with no other way of acquiring just the weapons. There are many weapons with balancing issues but what is worse is that new weapons are initially released in a state that makes them overpowered and then they are later \"rebalanced\" to make them hard to use or worthless after the next new weapon is released.\n\nCheating is rife in the game and gameplay is constantly interrupted by players that are cheating and that are intentionally trying to ruin the game for others. The automated anti-cheat is ineffective and inadequate in dealing with the problem, players that are banned return under a new account within minutes and players that have been playing the game for years and who have spent countless funds on the game have been known to be banned without reason or rhyme.\n\nAs the game's population has been dwindling for some time now it has become increasingly harder for players to find games due to the matchmaking not being able to adequately match players up for games. The skill gap is incredibly large. You will sometimes be paired with new players that have just started the game or be thrown in with players that have clocked up thousands of hours on the game. This can make for very uneven, unfair matches which at the end of the day are just not fun and will make you feel like you are being punished to the point where you won't want to play anymore and will need to step away.\n\nThe grind is VERY real. To buy legendary weapons, new vehicles, weapon modifications, equipment upgrades or high quality kill themes and clothing you need a LOT of in game money. This means playing hours and hours of matches that are often unevenly team balanced, have cheaters in them or where players disconnect from your team leaving you to suffer an inevitable defeat. \n\nFurthermore the developers seem to just be in it for themselves, they do not communicate with their community and promise the earth yet they never deliver or what they do deliver is either broken as hell or a cash grab. Support will not provide support in most cases unless it's a sales issue where the company will profit. Free to play users can be ignored by support for weeks as priority is given to players that have spent money on the game. \n\nThere has been many shady occurrences where Gamersfirst staff have offered to unban accounts that have been suspiciously banned without reason for a onetime payment. The amount of which also exceeds the amount of a full price title.\n\nBillions of dollars have gone into making this game what it is today and it still feels unfinished and buggy. You can also be damn sure that the money that is spent on the game isn't going into making the servers any more stable. Servers can feel very laggy at times and this can affect your shots connecting with other players which can cost you the match. Ultimately it just feels frustrating when your shot connects with its target on your screen but on your opponents screen they didn't even see you fire and have already killed you.\n\nThe game is incredibly un-optimised. It has memory leaks and problems with the client's core coding. It requires a very high end PCs to even be able to keep a stable 30FPS even then you may encounter issues. Without playing the game on high settings everything becomes very washed out and bland and all player customisation is more or less lost. I have seen players ask on the community forums often about how to upgrade their computer to be able to play APB without issues. I would NOT recommend upgrading your PC to play this game. Upgrade it to play other, more complete and better games made by companies that don't just want what is in your wallet. There are developers out there that deserve your cash and that actually care about those playing their games.\n\n[b]This is coming from someone who has been playing the game for 6 years, 2000 hours and who has spent over the same figure on in-game cosmetics, vehicles and weapons. Take your money elsewhere. This game will never get any better. Spend your hard earned money on a game that will be ultimately worth your time, money and respect. Do not give it to these crooks. They prey on players with addictive personalities and they do not respect you, they just want what is in your wallet and they won't stop until they have taken every penny.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1323637599, "timestamp_updated": 1507576790, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819165647029876709", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33569089": {"recommendationid": "33569089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071416891", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 48392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1529290837}, "language": "english", "review": "Game was great when it came out.

My hours presented here aren't represenative of my actual time spent in game, as I did not use Steam for APB for the longest time.\n\nThe original game had an idea of an emergent world, the \"original gta multiplayer\" style design. The developers had a vision, the game looked good, it ran good, and it was fun to play. Due to a slew of bad decisions and problems however, RTW went out of business and had to sell the game to Gamersfirst, whom, as you may know, were an awful company.\n\nThey removed pretty much any form of competitive play, such as the old ladder system and they gutted the threat system to help \"remove toxicity.\" They rebalanced everything with the idea of RNG being a major balancing factor, reducing the fluidity of the gameplay and making it feel cheap. They added many mechanics to fundamentally lower the skill ceiling of the game, such as car-det, where you can explode your car and the speed of the explosion is based on your proximity, so you can get out and detonate it and it instantly detonates, resulting in a few free frags. Did i mention it notifies you that a car is going to explode via sound, but, theres been a bug since it was added to the game where the sound won't play? Most of the bugs, just like that one, have been present for five years or longer. You can still throw projectiles through doors, you can still glitch objectives in buildings, you can still see players names through walls, hitreg and \"ghost shots\" are extremely common even still, among other things.\n\nThe old GamersFirst also was well reknowned for being liars, most of the major features they released were not their own work and were previous assets RTW had, as many people were able to prove on the old forums. The developers lied in many interviews, you can find this out with a little sleuthing about Revoemag and Neume. After a short time, they tried to \"clamp down on toxicity\" and started to ban players for \"cheating\" and yes i mean \"cheating\" not cheating. For instance, the old carebear situation on the West Coast server, a player known as fishamajig was banned by a developer named Byrt for \"cheating\" because he was streamsniping a certain group of players the developer often played with. He was later unbanned and they admitted fault months later, but it still ruined his reputation. Tiggs followed suit with this when fairfight was added to the game. This did nothing but harm the playerbase and give the outside audience a perspective of APB being plagued by cheaters. And by lying, they also lied about the major upgrades they were making with the engine. The old G1 lied about their progress and instead pushed a console release, which is buggy and barely performs, and more gambling aspects to the game.\n\nHow do I know they lied? Well, a new company, Little Orbit, purchased GamersFirst, and openly admitted in one of their earliest announcements that almost no work was done on the engine upgrade. Just another nail in the coffin. Currently, LO has breathed some life into the game, but, the existing servers are ddosed constantly, LO likely doesn't have the financial resources to mitigate it properly as well, its not well mitigated. All of the balance problems and bugs still exist. Their crowning accomplishment was adding BattleEye, which, actually killed the cheating almost entirely. If they can get the engine upgrade out so the game actually performs and doesn't stutter, even when using picmip level graphics with all audio files replaced, it may have a chance. As of right now, its not even a shadow of what it used to be, it's been completely squandered and I would encourage you to stay as far away as possible.", "timestamp_created": 1543389564, "timestamp_updated": 1543389640, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 71, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.847704470157623291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30990460": {"recommendationid": "30990460", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980286812", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 262361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549655495}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this 4000+ hours.

Turns out the reason they decided to do an engine upgrade was to release the game on consoles, to breathe money into their wallets. But to keep the players they said at first that it was intended primarily for PC. They lied. Only if the console release works out will they put it out for PC too. The console releases this far has been ridden with bugs, crashes, FPS drops and unstable performance in general, though the graphics are nicer to look at.

Their forum moderators became anonymous puppets used to lock topics or deleting them entirely. \n\nOther reviewers already told that the community is worse than any actual skin disease.But i ain't gonna spare you any details,[b]because here goes the actual review.[/b]\n\n[u]1:The community[/u]\n\nSince i've decided to talk about it,let me tell you my perspective on the groups of pepole playing this game,but don't worry,apart from normal pepole,they're all equally cancerous and unfriendly.\n\nDon't get me wrong,i'm trying to be as much neutral as possible in this review,i'm not \"hating\" on the game or anything,but stating the obvious.\n\nIn this game,you don't shape to the community:it's the community that shapes you.I'f you're a pretty average dude from the start and wanna try to intereact with the community,You're f*cked.You WILL try to get more and more attention,and most of the time,it leads to those paths:\n\nYou become a(n):-a*shole\n-\"Famous\" drama queen\n-Cheater (both of the above can still apply)\n\nHigh rank cheating became so common to the point where there's always drama (yes,actual drama,with backstabs,[url=https://disqus.com/by/DetectiveAPB/]and keemstar clones[/url] .) around big names cheating for fame,and i'm not fearmongering,these pepole actually get a permanent ban in the end.\n\nNow for the forum community,it's a great gathering of radioactive snowflakes,i like to think that there's there's 3 factions,all equally as toxic:\n\n-       The Famous,that almost get agreed to everytime they open their mouths,get their butth0les licked clean everytime while being the leaders of huge circlejerks.\n\n-       The RP White knights,that will never stop defending one of the devs team with the worst track record i have ever seen with their content updates (can you blame them when the company bought a broken game's license on Unreal engine 2?)\n\n-       The Idiots,that just hate the game,(no matter what the reason is,or i'f there is even one),responding to one of them,even when proven right,grants you either a \"shut up you silver\",or a long paragraph,just to say \"f*ck you\".\n\n[u]2:The gameplay:[/u]\n\nNow about something a bit less depressing for a moment,the game is not P2W,it can be Pay 2 Skip at best,but not P2W,the gameplay is fairly ok i'f you have good tracking skills and good friends,and when there's no N-HVRs around to one shot you everytime there's wind on your skin.\n\nLet me talk about the N-HVR:one bullet does 850 of damage at a maximum range of 90 meters ,and is pinpoint accurate when crouched.\n\nA vanilla character has 1000 hp in total,and one bullet from any gun (except Less Than Lethal,obviously),or a fall from 10m will make you vulnerable from the HVR,and will make you a sitting duck in open areas,and you can't avoid them.\n\nThey can also be quickswitched (unless they magically fixed it),giving you instantly a huge advantage over the enemy.\nI'f you mod them right,you're pretty much always pinpoint accurate,and quickswitch even faster.halving your TTK.You just lost basically 1 second on it (0.75s),giving the opponent no time to react fast enough to fall back.\n\nYou wanna know where the joke is?his accuracy was nerfed.\n\nA sniper riffle's accuracy was nerfed instead of the stupidly high damage.\n\nSome mods are essential,some are purely pointless,Everyone uses the 4x4 Vegas because it's the 2nd fastest vehicle in the game,who's accelerating almost as fast as the 1st best vehicle in terms of acceleration ,is dumb easy to turn with,and is the 2nd tankiest car of the game,see a problem?\n\nI could tell even more,but i ran out of space to type on.\n\n[u]3:The \"Dev unicorn\" situation[/u]\n\nWhen i said that the devs are curling into a ball in an atomic bunker,i mean it.\n\nThe community manager never interreacts with the forum dwellers,except when it comes down to selling stuff (guess why),the devs don't listen to the community,but when they do,it always ends horribly for the game.One obvious balancing issue [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD5Af1Ge39s] on one gun [/url] was fixed after 6 months.(look at 1:30,that's just how bullsh*t it was.) \n\nSo,let me give you one rhetorical question:\nAfter i told everything i learned from this game,will you still play this game?\n\nEDIT: \n[b]2017:[/b] Stuff happened,Check the comment section.\n[b]2018:[/b] The game switched owners but nothing changed so far, it's only been a few weeks at the time i'm writing this, depending on what happens with cheaters and game balance, i might

Due to the lack of people still playing this forces the matchmaker to find the best fit it can. Resulting in very 1-sided matches. A few examples: https://imgur.com/a/JnklWEd. \nThis matchmaking problem is guaranteed to get worse when the proposed 'centralized matchmaking' is introduced, as these stacks Little Orbit are catering to won't need an excuse to join lower rank lobbies to be matched against you anymore.\n\nWant to provide unbiased feedback on this topic in a friendly manner on the official forums?

Even though Little Orbit admits no work has been done, they still insist on 'updating' to the old UE3.5 that was released back in 2009. The few players left are expecting APB 2 but in reality this offers nothing that will change the game in any game saving way.\n\nGiven Little Orbit being a small company that appears to just be a group of mates, and their history of practicing monetization, I have very big doubts that APB will last long enough to see it's re-creation on Unreal 4 as they claim in their roadmap. \nIf they truely did have the resources to even make a UE4 project as large as APB themselves to begin with, they wouldn't have pointlessly bought this dead game along with other failed titles earlier this year to use as a live services ($$$). (For reference it took Realtime Worlds 200+ staff, 3 years and over $100m to develop APB originally).\n\nAt this point it's already been 9 years since APB's original release and it's effectively closed down twice. Thanks to the server merge the oceanic server (Hans) was merged with a US server (Jericho), resulting in AU/NZ players now having 200ms ping. Repeated minor seasonal events still suffer the same server crippling bugs year in year out and Little Orbit can barely keep the remaining 3 under populated servers up during peak times (Rumored to be due to DDoS attacks).

And to be truthful, the positives are beginning to fade leaving merely negatives.[/i][/b] \n\nAPB: Reloaded is a shadow of its former self in many regards, and these days is a shambling mess that won't warrant attention for much longer. With a dwindling playerbase and a greedy publisher, things have been turning sour as of late. Years ago during the original APB, the game looked and performed better for what it provided. Sure, it was a mess back then and it still is now. But some aspects were better back then, from what I've heard.\n\nAs a player who had played the game for well over 2,900 hours, I have experienced just about all there is to be offered by the game. And maintaining my honesty, there's some great potential locked away in this game. The potential for player designed content is stunning, and no other game provides such depth for customization on such a broad scale. Other games like EvE Online might provide an excellent character creation suite, and racing games like Forza (can't recall which one specifically) that have in depth car customization exist... But no other game brings systems akin to those present in other titles all into one MMO. Sounds great, doesn't it? If only it wasn't nearly impossible to get into the game.\n\nBack a couple of years ago when I started playing APB:R, there were times I had to force myself to play to get accustomed to the game. I loved it too much to let it go, but it wasn't doing me any favours because it was (and still is) very harsh on new players. All the new free content is almost exclusively available to high ranking players with lots of experience, or to those who wish to become a wallet warrior using the in game cash shop. Now, to put it bluntly... No, I do not think APB is very Pay2Win. Are there some P2W aspects present in the game? Yeah, there is. But almost all of the things that will affect you in an actual match, things that dictate your performance against other players, can be achieved without dropping a dollar on the game. Most paid items merely exist as a shortcut to something that you can still earn on your own, but it'll take a lot of work to get those items. \n\nBut, more on the subject of the game rather than the playerbase; how is it really? Well, it's a glorified version of Cops vs Robbers you used to play as a kid in your back yard when you were a kid. That, and then an insane amount of customization potential. The customization elements are rock solid and very enjoyable to use, and you'd be very surprised with the things that some people are capable of creating in game. But the game... How does it run? Well, poorly. The thing about a lot of people who play Free2Play games is that they aren't usually very wealthy and can't afford much in terms of paid games or a strong computer to play them on. APB tends to perform rather badly for some lower end hardware configurations which frankly kills that part of the market. Unless you have a very high end computer, you best be ready for feeling serious stuttering in game. However the dedicated servers that the game is hosted on are also rather bad. The server hardware is slowly being worked on to be upgraded, but it will take a long time for full deployment of the new hardware. Unfortunately, the new hardware that provides better server quality (not by much) is only high end consumer grade desktop hardware. Not server grade stuff... But consumer grade stuff. Disappointing, really.\n\nThe combat in game is somewhat hampered at times due to the condition of the servers, which results in poor hit detection for some people and frequent lag spikes on certain servers with the older server hardware. Driving can also be awkward, as driving in APB isn't like in other games. According to the developers, certain things are bound to the server and you have to interact with the server in order to interact with certain items... Like vehicles. There's an easily noticeable delay in steering and throttle for vehicles as you are technically sending commands to the server to move your vehicle, then waiting for it to confirm those actions and send information back to you for your game to display on your monitor. So to put it briefly, the combat and driving can be rather clunky at times.\n\nAll in all though, is the game worth it to try and get into? Currently, it's not quite there. Unless you absolutely adore the customization options available, then it isn't really worth your time to start playing it right now. The amount of headaches you'll have to deal with is a massive turn off for fresh players. Not to mention the community is quite frankly rubbish. There's trolling jerks left and right, along with closet cheaters that mask their cheats as skill in order to make up for their own shortcomings so they can be good at a mere video game. A better time to jump on this game would have been a little over a year ago, but things are improving so it might be new player friendly again sometime soon. Currently the devs are working on updating the core engine of APB: R to make things substantially better from a development point of view, but if they can't make that work and create new content to keep people around... Well, this game won't become the MMO everyone plays and it'll just be another MMO that most people just look at once and say \"nah...\". It's up to you if you want to jump into this game how it is now, as it's rough in a lot of spots but a few things shine so bright.\n\nGame Rating: 7/10 for what the game is capable of, but 5/10 for the community that calls APB:R home.", "timestamp_created": 1397201911, "timestamp_updated": 1407278172, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 763, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.864574909210205078", "comment_count": 46, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11782530": {"recommendationid": "11782530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016675400", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 98697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545938870}, "language": "english", "review": "After having played this game for 3 years and put over 1000 hours into it. I can say for certain that this game is a fundamentally flawed broken unfinished piece of sh!t, no one wants to play this game and FOR A GOOD REASON.\n\nApb has a huge potential to be something great, It has the hands down best customization any game ever made has to offer. You can create your own cars and clothing and truely be anything you want to be with little limitation. But on the gameplay side of things, while the the idea behind the gameplay and the missions and all that stuff is solid, the fundamental design flaws prevents it from living up to that potential. On top of that, the game is littered with many bugs, imbalances and, serious client side and crippling server side performance issues. And most importantly, this game attracts and empowers a lot of duchebags to do maximum duchebaggery, they are like the soul of APB (and not in a good way)\n\nSo what are these fundamental game design flaws?\n\nMap designs that do not take into account what this game is about and how it is played, players love exploiting the flawed map designs to cheat the mission by placing items on high up unreachable places and obstructing or destroying the only way to get there, making the whole mission invalid and granting them an automatic win. Or putting the item in a car and circumvent the speed penalty for doing so by just pushing the car with another car and driving on the part of the map that is impossible to intercept.\n\nMission designs that give no consideration to the locations or nonsensical objectives that dont take into consideration the nature of the game. For example, investigating an ATM in a middle of an open 80-150m space with no cover and surrounded by sniping positions. Or pointless objectives that are impossible for one of the teams to do, like stopping a car from going through 3 unspecified checkpoints on random locations on the map. Some mission objectives are placed in locations that greatly favor one of the teams. \n\nAlmost all missions in this game require you to camp the objective, the whole game is based on camping and some combinations of map locations and mission objectives make it impossible to finish some missions because the enemy team is camping some roof top that has only one way up with guns pointed at it and is too high to be sniped.\n\nTheres also weapons that dont belong in this game, Such as the OSMAW rocket launcher that makes any semblance of a balance in this game, hit rock bottom.\n\nNo one will ever fight fair, they will use every dirty trick in the book, any given opportunity to cheat the mission and will have no mercy for your rank 25 noob as.s.\n\nThey will be rude and obnoxious about it, they will message you without provocation just to insult you during or after the mission when they won it. The forum community is just as rotten.\n\nI also have to mention the broken matchmaking that throws low level beginner players against high level duchebags that have unlocked every possible balance breaking gear and know every possible game exploit and are not ashamed to use all that to stomp the low level new players that dont have jack sh!t unlocked. The more game breaking gear is, the higher level locked it is, making sure that people who dont need it to win the mission have it and people who could really use it dont, witch tips the scales to a 90 angle between both sides.  \n\nIf you have no job and live in your mom's basement, even you will find this game to be the biggest grind fest ever conceived, if you do not have a sh!t bucket nearby, this game is not for you. Even with premium, be prepared to put at least 400 hours to get on a level playing field with the rest of the players or your as.s will be stomped every mission you do. You will get 90% grind and 10% actual enjoyment before you get to a point where you have all the necessary gear unlocked and can start playing the game just for fun.\n\nIf all of this wasnt enough, G1\" is \"working hard\" to add all kinds of new and exciting ways to be an as.shole in the game. Such as the \"car surfer\" character mod that allows your character to ride on top of a car and fire any bul.lsh!t weapon you want at your opposition who is chasing you and blowing up their car, eliminating every little remaining chance for the enemy team to get their hands on that item you are running away with like a pus.sy instead of fighting, throwing out the last remaining bit of fairness and balance out the window and ensuring the victory for your team.\n\nA car surfing OSMAW as.shole on top of a car with other cowboy hat duchebags is like a cherry on top of a stinking sh!t cake. It is the symbol of everything that is wrong with this game.\n\ni also forgot to mention, the gun play is a joke, there is no proper bullet collisions with map objects, making you hit invisible forcefields and random objects you arent even aiming at, your weapons lock up and dont shoot if you pressed shoot a tiny bit too soon after you finished climbing a ladder or getting out of the car. There is no such thing as hitboxes for body parts or headshots or any of that modern stuff, the whole player is one big hitbox (usualy bigger than the player model so they can kill you without even touching you. The servers run on a 40ms (ideal conditions - also never) tick rate that effects the gun play, and other aspects of the game. This means things only happen every 40ms, you can feel this delay the most when you are driving a car or pressing F to do an action, you can also see the shots you fired at lets say a car, hit it after some delay. This is kind of a problem to the gun play, you get the kill or not depends a lot not on your skill but on factors like if your shots are at the beginning or the end of that 40ms gap, witch is also greatly effected by crippling server side lag issues. It also seems that some people are favored by the server over others, they are so called lag armor users or people that kill you faster than the max fire rate of the weapon they are using. Its different from person to person, i guess the server somehow lines up people in a specific order when it processes information coming from them. There is also a big problem called ghost shots, its when you shoot but for whatever reason the server doesnt register any of your shots.\n\nSo yeah, this game is a really good idea, but the execution is terrible, dont waste your time unless you are a masochist like me.\n\nTL;DR\n\nSerious client side performance issues and crippling server side performance and bugs.\nMaps designed for the wrong game.\nMissions placed blindly, not taking location consideration or what game this even is.\nRude community, especially on the forums.\nCamping, Using exploits, taking advantage of the fundamental design flaws and other kinds of cheating to win missions.\nThis game is 10% fun and 90% frustrating grind.\nBalance breaking Weapons that do not belong in this type of game.", "timestamp_created": 1408468832, "timestamp_updated": 1410954067, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1236, "votes_funny": 94, "weighted_vote_score": "0.852874517440795898", "comment_count": 49, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39900267": {"recommendationid": "39900267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113613434", "num_games_owned": 553, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 4289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1522876608}, "language": "english", "review": "I started to play APB way back in 2012/2013.

(Yes I know, its as epic as it seems)\n- And you can even chill in the game's social area where you can edit your car, clothes, face, and just hangout with other bros and bro-dettes.\n\nAll-in-all if you want a game in which to customize stuff with, this is your game.

The overall concept behind this game and the competitive aspect is AMAZING. I love it. \n\nThe customization you can do in this game is something I have never seen nowhere else. EVERYONE can be unique in their way, you can literally customize any piece of clothings and cars you have, and there are PLENTY of clothes available.\n\nThe missions are repetitive but they're still very enjoyable. Some maps can give an advantage to an opposite team, but that's not the biggest issue.\n\nEvery gun classes has their pros and cons, and each of them can be used in different situations. Heck, even the different classes of grenades have different uses. \n\nYou can put \"perks\" for your character and your gun which will give you some bonuses-maluses depending on what you prefer. \n\nNow that this has been said...\n\nGamersFirst is a really shit company that doesn't care about either its playerbase neither their game in general. Their goal is to make as much money as possible while you're still playing their fucking game until you're out of it.\n\nEach and every time they release a new weapon it will most certainly be incredibly unbalanced for at least 4-5 months, so that the players will be so tempted to buy the damn gun. Buying guns permanently in this game costs A LOT of money, and it's even more retardedly expensive if you want it on more than one character. Oh, and since it's a new gun you'll have to pay some more.\n\nThe matchmaking system is retarded. If you're gold, most of the time the servers will force you to go in a gold server but nobody plays in those, so they either go in silver servers and ruin silver's days OR they derank on purpose so they don't have to deal with that. That is, until they win a lot of games because they're obviously much better than actual silvers so they rank up to gold again, so they want to derank... You can easily see why it can become a major issue in the meta.\n\nSome missions are very unfair to one of the team. Depending on the mission, sometimes the enforcers are way way in favor, and vice versa.\n\nOh and the anti-cheat system. It can take a while before it does something and sometimes it can ban people that weren't cheating. Meanwhile there's a retard teleporting everywhere and plowing everyone in the server.\n\nHonestly, I think the concept is so beautiful and could be so much better.

Keep in mind I haven't quit this game, but more of retiring from it until futher notice.\n\nNow I can agree with a large amount of new players who have just tried this game, yes there are a few hackers out there, it makes it fustrating and you never want to touch this game again unless they fix it. However you'll find some sort of cheater in any F2P game, whether it be an aimbot, they're abusing a glitch, wallhacks, invincibility, etc. I understand that with FairFight they're trying to push back the amount of hackers in the game, but with each new day that passes by, these people will find a way to try and bypass it and survive on this game a little longer, even if it means one extra hour of tormenting the playerbase, and once that character is banned, it's that easy for them to make a whole new account and start it all over again.\n\nHowever I've put up with my fair share of hackers and all that crap over the past 5 years in this game, and while it does tend to annoy me, it's never gotten to me to the point I've uninstalled APB. I just put up with it and wait for the next mission. My problem with this game at the moment, is the lack of content recently. It's been over 2 years now since the last contacts were released, and basically everyone who is R255 either sits in social cause there's nothing to do, they make a brand new character and level that to 255, rinse-repeat, or just leave the game until something new comes up to bring them back for a short period. Some players have even asked for a new game-mode, such as turf wars or racing district, instead of picking between repeated missions with the same opp, or fight club.\n\nBut what do we get instead? Joker box after joker box with a new gun that tends to be useless compared to some of the original weapons, and then you decide to release another version of that JMB weapon for credits or by forcing your players to spend 100's of dollars just to get it as a loyalty reward. I get it, a free-to-play game needs to get it's revenue from somewhere, and for APB it's the marketplace, but to care more about another gamble box over actual content for players in action districts like a new contact? No wonder why everytime I get on the game looks dead as f**k.\n\nIt really dissapoints me, as I saw alot of potential in this game, but to see where it's landed itself now makes me wish I could pull the plug on it before it suffers any longer.

I've been playing this game for a very long time now and have came to the ultimate conclusion that, yes, hackers rule all of APB, it \"IS\" Pay 2 Win, and Gamers First will not do anything about it ever!\n\nNow, here are the reasons:\n\n1)  Hackers are their primary source of income.\n\nNeed I say more?\n\nMost of these guys that are hackers are little rich bleep nozzles who aren't good and instead of actually trying to get good, they buy hacks, and if I wasn't wiser, they're probably purchasing the hacks directly from the same people who run the freaking game.\n\nI know this all sounds strange.  But over the years I've played this, I've noticed so many hacks I didn't even know that many have existed.  Walls, Aimbot, Lag Hacks, you name it, its in APB or has been.\n\nAnd whats even funnier, oh ya'll are gonna love this.... The hacks seem to change out every couple of months or so.  Its like they're on a subscription plan to hack!  I have little doubt of that.\n\nNow, if you throw money at this game, it helps you out dramatically.  I use to think that, well, you can get these guns in the game with in game currency if you just play for long enough, but no... no, no, no, nooooo, this is not true.  For example, you can buy an OCA with in game currency, however, if you use money to purchase an OCA Whisper, well, its about 3x better of a weapon from what I've experienced when using it.\n\nI know some of you hackers, trolls, and others are going to downvote this, but w/e, it is what it is.\n\nThere are some things that make this game good, dont get me wrong.  I think when it was first developed they had \"some\" good intentions.  I'm not sure how far those good intentions go however.\n\nThe good things about APB are, the customizations in the game are 2nd to none.  Highly customize your car, your body, your clothes, even create songs and themes.\n\nAnother good thing is all the events that they hold.  I really like that and I wish other games would do it more often.  For example, they have a Halloween event, xmas event, and lots of others all throughout the year.  Also they do special events.  For instance, they just had an event where if you get so many kills a day, you unlock 20 Joker Mystery Boxes.  It was cool.\n\nNow, this is where the good things stop.\n\nOk, so one thing about the Joker Mystery Boxes, they hold special permenant weapons that you can unlock, however there is a slim chance of getting one.  Actually, a way way way way way too slim of a chance of getting one.  I unlocked 60 Joker Mystery Boxes and didnt get 1 permenant weapon.  60!\n\nI feel bad for people who spend money on this game that dont hack honestly.\n\nI feel bad for people who spend money on this game period.  At least until Gamers First does something about the horrible hacking community they have in APB.  Which, from the looks of things, they're never going to do anything about.  Because like I said, refer to point 1) in the beginning of this review.\n\nIt all makes sense.  They say, oh we implemented Fair Fight and that will take care of the hackers in APB.  Yeah, well, Fair Fight only gets rid of the blatent hackers, the ones that skip all over the map... shoot a lot faster.... and get 30 kills and 0 deaths contantly.  Problem is, theres so many more hackers that go undetected by Fair Fight, and most never get caught.  And I'm guessing for good reasons too.\n\nI really have had some good times in APB, but there's been way more bad times than good I can say.  Mainly fighting the hackers.  I just got out of APB and every match was against hackers, I mean come on, all I want is a decent match without hackers, is that so much to ask for?\n\nOne more thing, this game has lagging unlike any other.  I'm not sure why, or how its possible that this is the \"ONLY GAME\" that lags like this, but its really annoying.  I sort of feel like the hacks have a big part to do with it honestly.  I think the hacks are actually coded into the software itself and it compensates for them through lag to make up for the time.\n\nAnyways.\n\nIf you're new, welcome to Hackworld.  If you don't hack, I wouldn't even waste your time like I have unfortunately :(\n\nAlso, as a side note, the APB community is the absolute worst community I've ever experienced in the history of gaming.  Absolute Worst!\n\nAll the legit players that I know wish and hope that this game will come around and that the hackers will be all gone and dealt with one day, but honestly, I just dont see that happening.  They've made their choice.  And instead of fixing that, they shove out more things for people to buy on the marketplace.  Its disgusting really.\n\nIf they would just get rid of the hackers, this game could really shine and be a legitimately fun game that thousands of people would spend hours enjoying with their friends.\n\nI'll continue to play this game until I get all the achievements, which isn't far from now, and also my criminal to 255, which is not far off.  But after this, I won't be seeing much of this game anymore until Gamers First decides to actually do something about their disgusting community of hackers, trolls and the sorts.\n\nIf you'd like a list of [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamesyouabsolutelymusthave]Games You Absolutely Must Have[/url], check out our group here on Steam and we'll be happy to show you some alternatives to this mess.", "timestamp_created": 1467100215, "timestamp_updated": 1467100215, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.740374624729156494", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19149471": {"recommendationid": "19149471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005060973", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 166361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1532150972}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoy playing a game in permanent beta, this game is for you.\n\nWhile I've clocked many hours (have another 1.5k+ before the steam merge), I don't think I can reccomend this game to anyone.

It died, passed on to another dev team, and all seemed pretty legit. I sank, as of this moment, 1,107 hours into this game. I really enjoyed it. It was *mostly* mindless fun, granted with a few exploits and a fairly toxic community, but I could handle that.\n\nThe customization is probably the best of nearly any game that exists, aside from the likes of Second Life. The ability to make decals, tattoos, edit basic features of your clothes, change some of the layering, and a slew of other things causes the customization to be the only highlight worth truly looking back on. However, this is a double edged sword. The sheer amounts of weeaboos and bronies that post their graffiti art of their favorite child anime characters or pony creature all over the damned place is nausiating. Now, don't get me wrong, I've put up some edgy stuff on the walls and such, but nothing as cringe as the stuff weeaboos and bronies post. This is sad as there are a few who have used the custom editor to make some SERIOUS works of art, but a lot of what's being thrown around is sheer cringe. If you can work to ignore this, then the customization is the best thing about this game and actually shines better than most other games with customization options.\n\nThe combat and driving are so similar in their shortcomings that I can lump them into the same paragraph. Both are there, both effectively do their job, but both are lacking. Despite having just enough depth to give a separation between the skilled and the killed the both of these aspects mostly seem more like a detailed framework that was never fully realized. The combat, however, has given way to a slew of hackers that exploit it for all its worth and make combat almost unplayable. Between the various wall hacks and aimbots used it's a wonder anyone attempts combat, except for the obvious fact that combat is required for progression. \n\nMissions are mostly repetative, though not without a mild amount of charm and replayability. Don't get me wrong, there's a LOT of different types of missions, but you almost ALWAYS get stuck with fetch missions and zone control of some sort, and the infamous \"tug of war\". There ARE missions you can do that strictly revolve around a criminal player who gets caught committing a crime, but generally these missions only consist of turning in the items for stolen loot and then laundering the cash recieved while the enforcers try and take said loot/cash in as evidence. It's a lost oppertunity for the players to really drive the missions.\n\nThe community is where the game really starts to fall apart. Everything about the combat, driving, and missions can actually be enjoyable enough to be excused, but then the community gets factored in and these three things get smashed into the ground. Even the customization, as mentioned, takes a turn for the worst thanks to the garbage community. People scream venom and vitriol with nearly every word, hackers are ripe and abundant and thanks to poor work on the devs' part they're fairly audacious about it, bronies, weeaboos, and other such aspects of the community make it absolutely abismal to deal with.\n\nThe last nail in the coffin, as briefly mentioned, are the devs. Now, you're probably thinking \"What about the microtransactions?\" and I would agree, but these can be lumped into the problems with the devs. They really only care about the cash flow. Granted, every game dev needs to worry about paying the rent but the methods used in this game are amongst the worst examples of how to gain cash from a Free-to-Play game. Various weapons, to include special weapons, can only be purchased with actual cash. You'll often hear people complain about a weapon referred to as the \"Nano\". This weapon can ONLY be recieved by essentially gambling with real money and it's a difficult weapon to get. Sure, there's now a auction function in the game that lets you get it but good luck with that. Players generally only auction off the more undesirable of weapons, sometimes even openly preferring if their enemies (and even allies) have bad weapons to make themselves look better by comparison. Now roll these special weapons in with the hackers and you get a nightmare. So now you have to pay money to even compete with players that might be cheating right off the bat. Next you have to consider that the customization I sang praises about has a serious issue: If you want to make things of high detail you HAVE to pay money for a \"Premium\" that allows you, for a certain amount of time, to gain the capability to make detailed pieces. Basically, if you want to be creative you have to pay extra for it and this is only good for a set period of time. Also, this premium time CAN expire when you're not playing. You WILL feel cheated. Then factor in that if you complain about the hackers, the pay-to-win aspect of the game, or even various bugs and such the devs effectively ignore you, or worse punish you for pointing it out. This is why I avoid their Facebook and their forums. The devs charge you to compete, to be creative, and if you complain about the game's issues they'll cut you off.\n\nIt's been said; this game has been on a decline since it came out. It started good but slowly rotted with time. This is a game I want to like and want to enjoy again, but it's really damned hard to do that with the current state of the game, the autism of the community, and the mindset of the developers.", "timestamp_created": 1501913804, "timestamp_updated": 1501951390, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 69, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.790173172950744629", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36675670": {"recommendationid": "36675670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053558249", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 146394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550103057}, "language": "english", "review": "EDIT: i decided to edit this review, as i feel it doesnt reflect the game on its current state anymore although some points are still the same  \n\n The 1st thing is that, gamers1st, the company that killed this game no longer exists, its been bought( and essencially dismantled) by a company called LittleOrbit, so you might ask yourself \"oh man, this game will get good now!\" well.... lol lets talk about what they have done as of february 27 2019:\n \n -They added player to player trading(exelent feature, denies scammers which were a common thing)\n -They added more lootbox guns, one which (in my opinion) is the pinacle of... RNG to win? i would say p2w but the odds on those things arent the best (unless you know the RNG increase trick) what gun is it? a secondary shotgun revolver, it isnt as strong as a primary shotgun, but it defo is a shotgun still, in hands of a deece player its anoying to deal with \n -Anti cheat seems to have massively improved(or all the cheaters got bored and left, blatant ones at least), sometimes i still see players that MAYBE hack, the few times i saw that i was like \"hmmmm....\" it wasnt anything blatant as back in the day, likely just good players \n -They promised some engine updates and more overall content but... if the trend keeps going, its going to be money locked stuff\n\n Overall the anti cheat(if im correct) improvement and player to player trading are a massive improvement, the anti cheat alone id ALMOST recomend the game... almost, now to the original review\n\nShort answer: with friends? yeah its fun, without them every match is a 50/50(loss/win chance) (more a 30/80 but lets be optimistic) and really not worth playing unless youre into bad games\n\n Long answer: you may have noticed i got a quite a bit of hours in this game, thats because i used to play almost in a daily basis with a group of friends, most of them stopped playing after a while but i still get some fun out of this steaming pile of shit sometimes\n  \nOverall its very new player hostile, you will get farmed pretty much by vets, it happens all the time that max lvl high threat (gold 255) characters face new players as it is even close to being fair, your only option really is to try your best and eventually get to their level (of skill) so then you can properly play the game\n Hacking is almost a meme at this point, the ones that do hack dont even hide it anymore, fair fight and punk buster are really not doing their job, i dont understand how anti hack programs work, but people shooting you through walls, insta locking aim to 3 diferent people on 3 diferent sides and straight up tanking damage its imposible to survive even with high survivability modifications seems... hacky no? so why they still play? to cut off a long unnecesary history there is this  ahem, alegation that g1 themselves sells hacks for 40 USD a month\n This is just an example of many guns but, do you like shotguns? like pump action shotguns, theyre cool right? yeah so... the free version, called JG its pretty crap, its max effective range is like 8m (not joking) past that youre better of throwing rocks at your enemi- BUT WAIT! THE ARMAS MARKETPLACE GOT YOU A CSG 20! A SHOTGUN THAT ACTUALLY WORKS FOR REAL LIFE MONEY!!! the only thing they wont sell you for money is a bazooka (they used to, but not anymore) now, an argument most people will say is \"oh but, with the certain ammount of skill there is no such thing as pay to win in this game\" and yeah, thats true i used to say that myself a lot, but the game on its current state(lets get to that later) its really not worth playing so much to the point youre a living aimbot anymore\n Population is scare, i think there is around 500 active players total in each US server or something like that, its been so bad that if you want to level a contact in a certain district its 50% chance there is no one there, you can only properly level up if youre a silver threat or bellow, as a gold player youre forced with the blatant hackers and guys that says got over 10k hours in their game(i dont doubt them, but sheesh...) \n If you want to make money create yourself a criminal character, they are allowed to mug civilians and break stores for ram raiding, i made myself around 700k from 2h of ram raiding for 7 days (its really boring tho) this is atm the most efective way of making money in the game unless youre a living aimbot, be it the good or the bad way, enforcers only advantage is sweet cars really\n \n You still here? well lets talk about the positives then\n\n The customization is extremely deep, just google it a bit and you will see some very crazy characters, that is mostly due to the game symbol creator that allows you to create pretty much anything making the posibilities almost endless (if youre a free player, you are slighty limited, but with premium its really sweet) stuff from medieval knights to IRL celebrities, let your imagination go wild and you wont regret it, however it is a bit of a pain to learn how to properly use the symbol creator, i learned it because i was pretty bored one day lol\n Gameplay its actually really nice, there is overall 2 to 3 guns for every gun class, every single one of them feeling diferent, like for snipers you got yourself the heavy hitting but also heavy to carry HVR (.50 cal), if you want a more stealth aproach (its silencer doesnt actually work lol) you can try the DMR, a semi auto sniper rifle OR ON ARMAS MARKETPLACE A N-HVR HAVING THE 2 HITTING CAPABILITES OF THE HVR WITH THE MOBILITY OF A CRAZED BUNNY!, most of the guns tend to be diferent from each other, the starter gun STAR is one of the best of the game (but as youre starting you really dont know too well how to use it, because youre new)\n Customization doesnt only aply to clothes, but also on cars , many IRL iconic vehicles have passed through this game already (way too many general lees) sometimes you get to see some cars that only makes you wonder how the F he did that, but in cars its a bit diferent... you see, if you want to say swap your hummer (in game called pioneer) bumper for a bigger one then well... DOSH! only certain vehicles got free parts for you to swap, however the thing is, the cars that allow you to do that are some of the best of the game, at the end of the day this wont limit you gameplay wise at all, but only in fashion\n Progression is quite good (when there is people playing on the server you need), when you get close to level 195 and close to 255 it will get much slower, but overall level rewards tend to be quite good, mostly the 195 and 255 ones as they will give you free premium clothing (that you cant customize but still looks pretty good tbh) and give/unlock certain special guns and mods  to you that even if you may not know how to use them like the bazooka, its just fun to have a big boom maker you know? \n\n Some of my best memories are from this game, i was taught all i know from speaking and reading english on this game, when i started i barely knew a single word but today i guess im not bad, i know there is some grammar erros here and there but i hope it was posible for you to understand what i wrote\n \n This game once had the potential to become something wolrd wide famous, but every single game that G1 touches becomes a mess, no exeptions, at this point i really hope that the game will close, so it can rest in peace and not have its putrified pieces tied with duct tape running anymore", "timestamp_created": 1511271105, "timestamp_updated": 1551313467, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.773577094078063965", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32218928": {"recommendationid": "32218928", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970803684", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1530505744}, "language": "english", "review": "Great concept!, Great Interface, Great Game!\n\nBUT\n\nI've never seen anything like this from the customer service...

There's just simply no other game that actually has a detailed character editor that lets you put custom symbols on your character/character's clothing. Symbol and car customization are pretty weak on the other hand, due to the high limitations of the editor (Up to 100 layers for a symbol, annoying customization bar for cars doesn't let you place more than a couple of complex symbols without preventing you from saving). However, to get the most out of the editors, you'd have to buy premium otherwise your customization options are extremely limited (25 Layers for a symbol/3 symbols for clothes and character/7 symbols for cars). Also, a good amount of clothing options are locked away unless you pay a certain amount of money for them (Some things cannot be bought seperately and requires you to buy things in packs that can go up to 2099 G1C/US$26 because it includes a 30 day gun).\n\nAPB's gameplay is horrid. Most of the weapons work most effectively in one area but work poorly in other areas, which means you'll be spending half the match switching guns(which takes forever because you'll have to firstly go to an inventory area, then click a bunch of things to change your weapon, then wait to restock the weapon's ammo completely) to suit the situation that you're in, The driving has input lag for people with high ping, and most of the cars drive like their on ice (skidding everywhere and poor traction), The matchmaking is completely horrid, APB uses a \"threat\" system for matchmaking to show a player's skill. In late 2011, the threat system was changed from 30 threat levels(Bronze 1-10, Silver 1-10, Gold 1-10) to 4 threat levels(Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold). With the new threat system, it just throws in random people of different threats and gives the losing team the option of backup ([url=http://i.imgur.com/BWJt5nq.jpg]Example[/url]), which means that missions will normally always be one-sided. There's also not that much to do in the game, the only game types you can play are missions, fight club, and social. Missions are normally 4v4 objective based matches that lets you level your character's rating level up that takes place in different parts of the map, Fight club is a fixed section of a map (Waterfront's Baylan Shipping/Asylum (Beacon was removed for some odd reason)) that's more focused around killing people instead of doing objectives, social is where you go to customize things/use the marketplace/go AFK for no reason. The missions are really repetitive, mostly either involving you defending an area, or go to a place and press the action button, the placement for objectives is another thing that causes missions to be one-sided, as objectives can sometimes spawn in easy camp spots.\n\nOne of the things I dislike about APB the most is the cash shop. Before anyone makes assumptions, No, the cash shop guns are not overpowered, as a sheer amount of the cash shop guns are just re-meshes of a gun that's available for free. Most of the things in the cash shop will cost you a lot of money, with prices going up to US$50+ just for a pack containing one car with kits, one outfit and one gun for one character. The cash shop even goes to selling ludicrous items such as a \"friends and ignore list extender\" which adds 50 capacity to your in-game friends/ignore list for a hefty US$12.5. Sure, the devs have added a F2Per's option for obtaining cash shop items via the Joker Store, but the prices are pretty expensive. It will cost you 1000 Joker Tickets to buy a 3 slot cash shop gun for 7 days. However, the maximum amount of Joker Tickets anyone can earn within a week is around 1000, which means you will have no Joker Tickets to spend if you want to save up for something neat on the Joker Store.\n\nOver the years that I've been playing this game(even though I left the game between mid 2012-late 2013), this game hasn't gotten any better. Sure, you might say that the new anti-cheat(Fair Fight) is pretty cool, right? But then, Gamersfirst began to unban people off the ban list and straight up silencing people who bring up the matter([url=https://social-district.com/forums/topic/111-apbgate/]Read more here[/url]).

It was especially awesome being able to customize so spectacularly.\nEditting both your cars and  your characters was truly something remarkable for a game of it's calibur. But the gameplay was ... Eh, about as you'd figure judging by the theme of the game.\n\nThe game is full of repetition, and although most games are, I can certainly say that one can suffer burnout especially as time has progressed and the community in the game became more toxic. To the point of interrupting missions because they had it out for you. Granted, it has been a while since I have played so perhaps they have changed the fact that people can slam their car into you if they manage to hunt you down in game. Maybe now you just slip past each other. I doubt it.\n\nThis game ran smoothly when it first was being operated under G1 and I was not there for the previous iteration when the game was first released at all so I'm going by what I noticed. They made some changes, understandably, but over time this caused the game to run differently. To look different as well, in comparison to when I first played. The optimization that was with it had been altered, and it became obvious they started to shift the game completely. \n\nI don't hate them for trying to change how the game was compressed or whatever to entice more people to come play the free game. What I do hate, though, is that last I knew, this game hasn't been updated graphically (as they've chimed they would for years, my god it's a wonder they even put it out on the Ps4), and the gameplay hasn't been worked on since the original company died other than adding recoil. Oh and of course the botters, who don't seem to recieve enough of a punishment.\n\nLast I played, they were getting hit again with a ddos and once again people were just getting tired and quitting.\n\nTLDR:\nGame plagued by bad choices, toxic community, bots/hackers, lots of micro-stutter due to loading of compressed files, dated graphics and mediocre gameplay\nGame wins at customization of clothes, character and cars \n\nIn closing, I would only recommend this game if you have had the ability to tolerate other super toxic communities.

Gameplay is fun with tons of weapons to choose from, (although some weapons are more easily abused than others) and there is a perk system for cars, characters and weapons, resulting in in-depth and unique arsenals to play with. Character and vehicle customization is the most in-depth on steam, period. Many different clothing options and cosmetics to choose from, all of which is full customizable, from any color you want, to any design you can create. (This doesn't come with without its fair share of grind). The game is still riddled with hackers and exploiters, but it's not nearly as bad a people say. People also say it's pay2win, which isn't true, as the best guns and vehicles can be acquired, without needing real money.\nSOCIAL - 8/10\nGAMEPLAY AND BALANCING - 5.5/10\nGRIND & REWARDS - 6.8/10\n\n[b] Social: [/b] The game is quite social, as it should be for being an MMO, but this also makes a lot of sense because the social district, (the district where any crim, and any enforcer can simply hangout and talk) is not only used for socializing, but used for many of the core features which include: Customizing vehicles, creating custom emblems, customizing clothing, editing your character, make your own song that plays when you kill someone, buying Joker items, buying other people's items, trading, and probably some other stuff that I failed to gloss over. This social district is a place where players are not killing eachother like in the other districts. The social aspect of the game is the aspect of the game which I have almost no complaints about, other than the community being quite toxic. \nSOCIAL - 8/10\n\n[b] Gameplay & Balancing: [/b] Into the actual game, we have a lot more problems. The gameplay itself is solid and due to the open-world's interesting environments, you can have some very intense engagements. Now there are 3 ways to can get into the \"killing other players\" aspect of things; Open Conflict - Both open-worlds where any crim can shoot any enforcer and reverse, it's the most sandbox the game can get, although no one really plays it so ;l. You have the mission districts, which are the same 2 open-worlds, excepts to fight against the other faction, you have to engage in a mission, which requires you to either queue into a mission while goofing off in the map, or getting cought doing a crime (crim) or catching a crim commit a crime (enforcer). Out of all districts most people play these, due to the fact that you can level up your contacts, get money easier, and have a clear objective and goal, while working with other people. The last type of PvP district are the fight clubs, two to be exact. Fight club is basically a classic deathmatch, enforcer v criminal. It's definetly more Battlefield than COD however, with all the vehicles and relatively larger size of the maps. Of course the killing isn't fun if the killing isn't fair, so how is the balancing? Simply, not very good. You have a clear difference in terms of equipment and skill. Guns and cars (more-so cars) have clear upgrades from a base weapons, that is more of a grind, and can possibly also be bought. The problem is that the gameplay should be about the amount of skill a player has, not the amount of time or money a player has put on the game. But besides that some weapons, (upgrades or not) are just blatantly easier and more abusable than others. While a sniper is really-REALLY hard to use, a rocket launcher is really easy to use, and arguably more affective too. Cars just have blatant upgrades from one-another, you start off will a dumpster or something and you have to grind your ass off to get something good for you and your team. And to add on to that gap, people of higher skill groups join server of lower skill groups, due to the lack of players and amount of exploiters and hackers in higher servers. In conclusion...\nGAMEPLAY AND BALANCING - 5.5/10\n\n[b] Grind & Rewards: [/b] Games like these usually have a bad grind, lets see if APB can prove me wrong. There are multiple ways to get what you want in APB, for example, if you want a really nice car, you can either pledge your services to a contact in one of the districts, and level your rep with them until you have a high enough level with that contact to unlock the ability to buy the car. Or, you could choose to go to the social district, and either trade, auction, or purchase another player's car, which will potentially be more expensive, (still less of a grind) and not customizable. This applies to most things in APB, get it from a contact, or buy it from another player. This is where Joker products come in. Joker Distributions is a store found in the Social District, which is where you can buy all their guns, vehicles, cosmetics, and perks, all with Joker Tickets. These items are usually better than the regular ones that come with the contacts, and they usually are the ones selling a brand new weapons, or some really fancy kit for a car you want to pimp out. \"So how do I get joker tickets?\" You may be asking, well this is when gameplay comes back in. The best way (in my opinion) is to go into fight club and do as many challenges as you feel like doing, as you can get almost enough for a pistol if you do 14, this ofcourse means you have to be good and equipped, as it's fight club, and there's a saying. \"If you play fight club, you will lose your left sock,\" - mstche 2018. The other and more easy way is when you fully level up a contact, they start providing daily challenges for you. These are usually extremely easy so there's no point in not doing them, of course you only get 5-10 JT every challenge completed. But since there are 21 contacts max you can fully level for each faction, you can get quite a bit, if you're willing to spend a lot of time that day. Overall it seems pretty fair, and since the items here are better than the ones you pay for with real cash, that's an extra OK from me. Overall...\nGRIND & REWARDS - 6.8/10\n\nSo do I recommend this game? Well first try it out, I recommend with a buddy, it's not a big download. But if my review is so important, I do, if you can get over the garbage balancing, unfair matchmaking, and considerable grind.

A good 400-500$ down the drain unfortunately \n\nThe Cons / Game Breakers / 90% of this game\n\n- The worst matchmaking I have EVER seen in my life is ANY game. I've seen two silvers ( noobs ) with probably about 50 hours combined with a gold with maybe 70-90 hours at most ( At most, 190 hours combined ) go against 3 golds with over 8000 hours combined.\nI'm just speechless.\n\n- Cancerous community. The most common type of cancer among the shithole of San Paro is no doubt griefers \n\" The best way to avoid the cancer is to become the cancer \" -  a fellow anonymous San Paro enforcer\n\n- The last 15 fucking updates taking place once a month have been Joker Boxes or an Arma$$ marketplace update\n\n- I wouldn't mind spending 1-5$ for a gun reskin, 10$ at most for a super cool gun skin.. but they're fucking 40$ FOR ONE. EVERYTHING on the fuckin marketplace is overpriced. Admitedly they ARE cool though. It gets quite annoying when the last 15 updates in a row have been simply paid 40$ reskins of guns.\n\n- Corrupt developers. Proof : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtrxikKHAe8\n\n- Shitty optimization, however most mid- high spec computers wont have problems ONLY because this game is old.. no other reason. the code is an absoulute disaster.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrJ0qw3mDDc\n\n- No updates\n\n- Graphics have progressively gotten worse since 2010. They were a bit outdated in 2010, and here we are; 5 years later with even worse graphics then the outdated 2010 ones...\n\n- The most amature developers who break something while trying to fix another\n\n- No events. The few \" events \" are absoulute crap and I wouldn't even consider them to be events.\n\n- Hackers. Even with Punkbuster and Fairfight, Punkbuster has not detected new / recoded cheats for a good 2 years now  unless it has been detected since then on and not updated. Punkbuster NEEDS to go and has GOT to be replaced by VAC or BE. Fairfight on the other hand.. it's a bit controversal and I'm still on the fence about it. Some people claim they need to turn it up and start banning more, but then they complain about too many legits getting banned. They do need to turn up what it takes to get flagged, especially against higher  ranked \" edgy \" players, but at the same time, they also need to be more careful with who they ban. \n\n- The servers :  Probably fixed now, but servers are sometimes laggy and crash. They had no DDoS Protection before and it was nothing short from nightmare. Every 15 minutes, the server would get DDoS'ed and crash. Absoulutly unplayable.\n\n- The population is declining ( For good reasons, this game just needs to die )\n\n- Grindy as fuck after level 140\n\n- They can't properly balance guns even though the balance is OKAY\n\n- Too many broken promises. Been waiting for over 2 and a half years for an \" engine \" update and console release.. Let me break it to you.. this wont come around for ATLEAST another 12 months. Who knows where this game will be in 12 months? The community doesn't know for sure since we rely on G1 to tell us, and the truth is G1 has gotten their heads so far up their ass to even tell for themselves. Everything they'ved promised us has been broken. Hey G1 remeber about that racing district? LOL\n\n- G1's infamous money making startegy - Make an OP Gun and wait 8 months to nerf it after you made the big bucks. Then, a couple months down the road have a fair balanced game ( gun balance wise ) what it should have been in the beginning, but then you nerf the DECENT in game cash guns, and release an OP Armas real life cash gun. Rinse repeat rinse repeat etc\n\nThe pros : \n\n- The gameplay is admitedly fun. I like the mission objectives even though they are 90% of the time unbalanced, random, casual, and EXTREMELY repetitive.\n\n- Customization. So hard to explain how good this is.\n\n- Is not pay2win. I'm a bit skeptical about it since itt's grindy as hell, and I feel like theyre sorta leaning towards that direction since they have been releasing exclusive guns but it isn't that much of a big deal since theres only about 10 of them and the rest are reskins and they're not OP Other then the troublemaker which has been nerfed AFTER 8 MONTHS.\nIn my book, a game is pay2win if they offer you guns that aren't avaible with in game currency, but honestly this is an exception. this game is not pay2win. \n\nOverall this game is like a 4/10: \nIf it wasn't free, had bad customization, this game would easily be a 2/10.\nONLY Play this game if you yourself are a hacker looking for an easy game to hack or are willingly putting yourself up for a stroke. There is nothing good in this game other then the customization, which even if youre an artistic person, Please don't do it PLEASE. You'll be much happier drawing then putting up with the endless, frustrating grind to unlock decent customization without emptying your wallet.

Now that Little Orbit has stepped in, there's already been some fixes and changes, Battle Eye slapped on, talk of reviewing the storefront prices, and of course updating the engine to Unreal 3.5 (and 4.0 down the road).\n\nI run this on a GTX 960 with 16g of ram with an Intel i5 @ 3.5mghz and it's liquid smooth, so if your stronger hardware is struggling, it's on your end.\n\nAs for the P2W accusations, 90% of the game content can be aquired through contact unlocks, Joker Tickets etc. The shop-only weapons are more side grades, and honestly, the starting STAR 556 is really not that bad. I still use it every now and then. Just unlock a pump shotgun/SMG for range an HVR sniper, and that ever-present N-TEC and you can pretty much compete just fine. I'm not saying things are perfect, they never were, and never will be, and hopefully LO follows through and makes some changes to the earning/unlock curves and storefront prices.\n\nJust be prepared to be roflstomped by the folks who never left. Just remember, you make progress with your contacts win or lose, and when you start getting heated, hit Social and try your hands at making designs or songs.\n\nPremium speeds things up but if you're just here to kill people, it isn't really needed. Premium really only shines if you want to make complex designs and super fancy clothes/cars, as free accounts have (admittedly much) lower capacity on layers for decals and vehicle stamps.\n\nAnd remember, they're still dusting off the boxes and settling in.

And he says honestly it's because everyone else does it, so it's the only way to stay competitive. \n\nI even ask if he isn't afraid to get banned?

Don't get me wrong, you can have a good time on this game but from my experience over the past few days it's been a rare occasion that I've truly enjoyed my time on it. To start off, the community (what's left of it anyways) is one of the most toxic communities I've seen in a while. The majority of the playerbase insults one another all throughout the day, no matter what happens. There are many people who have been playing the game for a while now, and with the small community this makes matchmaking pretty unfair. You'll either get paired with people that have been playing for years or newcomers like yourself and it shows as soon as the match starts. There's also a huge learning curve in terms of how the guns work in the game which almost makes it seem like it isn't worth even trying to figure out since you're gonna get outgunned 80% of the time by the better players regardless. I put in hours upon hours trying to figure out how to use one gun, and while I did see slight improvement, it didn't matter one bit as the \"elitists\" trampled over me (maybe I just suck). Also the ranking is kinda broken. If you get to gold rank and one of the districts or both of the districts you want to join are anything below silver, you simply can't join even though the majority of players are in there, which in turn blocks progression in that particular area (This is what happened to me so if you want to switch from area to area freely and find matches without getting your progress hindered, it's best to try to stay at the silver rank aka win some lose some as bad as that sounds). In the end though, if you're looking for something to play and you want to have some fun there's a plethora of other free to play options other than this one.

To this day i still use this game to iron out driver kinks and test hardware for faults.  No clue why, but this game seems to be the best at letting you know whether or not your computer is worth its weight.  Still does too.\n\nFor now, i'm going to speak more into the game, more in depth on the content and world of APB:R, and its affects to real life issues.\n\nThe game is beautiful, and has so much potential, the world is still caughing up silly little secrets and jokes that even the most seasoned vet of the title has yet to discover.  There was a mobile app built that lasted roughly through beta, died out from the toxicity of the community, even though the community had actually asked for it.  If the players were more in tune to the forum than reactive to it, maybe some benefit could come of the game, instead we have vet players remaining silent as the community of fresh meat green horns play the game for a day and shape the future by speaking out on the forums.  There is a huge lack of communications, and slim to no community outreach program.  The changes made to the game that the vet players seem to dislike come from those who really do not know how to play the game in the first place.  OR, from those with computers that can't properly handle the game process.  I saw one person in the forum claim his Intel Pentium Dual Core was \"Gaming grade\" unfortuneatly, this is what we have to look forward to in the title that is APB:R.  Computer illiterate noobs, players who take the mentality of \"be what you cannot be\" too seriously, and a development staff just as toxic, though, not at all in the same way, the devs are just silent.\n\nPeople don't realize how destructive silence really is, sure you can /ignore you're way through the community, but you're being no better than the person opening their mouth and showing how unintelligent they really are.\n\nThe game itself is a hacker, many people claim he/she is a hacker, but from what i've seen (and being called an aimbotter myself) the game is the hacker.  The one thing that really rubs my fur the absolutely wrong way, hit detection.  The devs really broke the game trying to fix that for the noob players who claimed they hit someone when they really shot the vending machine, in the building next door... they have such terrible aim, and no weapon control.  So the devs went and reworked hit detection, well guess what... now the game lags out every single time a bullet comes near an opponent (op) the frames drop, and the game registers a few hits, but since it lagged so hard the gun only fired 3 rounds, and the op decides to take advantage of this and shoots back.  The game has really become a mexican standoff for each mission, when i started playing there was such a thing as \"Spray n pray\" or \"all out balls to the wall firefights\" now, well now it's just depressing.\n\nThe game itself is the hacker...\nThis has lead me to assume that many players i've opposed were the hackers, which then in turn lead to my anger generation going sky high.  I have a roommate who refuses to speak to me or even be near me when i'm playing APB:R, i have a few friends online who cannot play the game anymore because of how angry they get.  Honestly speaking, i too have stopped playing the game due to the anger problem, and the level neglect the development team has given the game.  Seriously, i would not be phased if they shut down the game for the new engine to be completed and start up the game then!\n\nThe silence i spoke of earlier, and the neglect, and the game itself being the hacker...\nThis can all be fixed simply by disconnecting the power cord to their servers, focus on building the new engine and console version, then merging the account's content into the new engine, and voila! new engine released, community was kept up to date, and the devs weren't split over 9000 ways.  However, that would make sense, and as i've seen the devs don't listen to logic, they do their own special way of thinking, which is \"take on the hardest, largest workload and pick highly unrealistic due dates, then completely ignore the dwindling community.\"  I've spent a couple hundred bucks on this game, i know others have too, there is NO shortage of funds preventing them from getting the job done, and their last post from a year ago made sense, true, it would take more time to hire someone new to aid in the development to train them on what does what, but honestly, i competent coder can see what the code is, what you want and make it happen.  Without complex tutorials teaching the guy how to code, without having to hold their hand, with a competent new hire coder, you give him a task, a due date, and you can bet that guy will bust his butt to make that due date, cuz he's the new guy, he's fired if he fails.  I'm not sure how that works when the boss has been so lax in the due dates for the game now, seeing as there is roughly just 5 people (claimed) to the company working on APB:R (and who knows what else from G1) they have devs taking vacations, devs spending company time playing the game on twitch.tv (effectively extending the new engine upgrade that much longer)\n\nThe company that handles APB:R aka \"Reloaded Productions\" or RP for short, is in a serious structure reworking.  They've become complacent in their duties, deadlines, and ability.\n\nThe base game though...\nThe game itself in a PvE perspective... as in, character customizations, customizations in general, and general concept, is absolutely perfect.  And when GTA:V launched it was BETTER than GTA:V by a long shot!  Though multiplayer wasn't really a GTA thing, it was modded into GTA:SA, which sparked the GTA:IV online aspect, which gave birth to GTA:O a concept that Rockstar Games didn't research on enough and flopped at launch, but they have since fixed it and so on...\nNow if only RP can learn from Rockstar Games (RG) what it means to \"fix\" something.\nI cannot stress this enough...\nThe devs at RP need to shut down APB:R and focus on the game engine only, fix that and start it up asap without split priorities, and THEN you can milk the dry cow for more money, or get a new cow and guarantee that milk will come.\n\nThis game currently has too many issues, and a super slow dev team, with an incompetent management system.\nAre you interested in playing the game?  Wait, just wait.\nDo i recomment you play the game?  Right now? god no, just wait until they launch the new engine.\nIs this game worth it?  So long as the toxic community further poisons the minds of the Devs into ruining the game, no, not at all is this game worth a dime, the devs and managing staff need to learn who to listen to, before they make changes at all.", "timestamp_created": 1463614621, "timestamp_updated": 1466192257, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.793130576610565186", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13448556": {"recommendationid": "13448556", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987045890", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 14091, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1531019748}, "language": "english", "review": "                                                                       The Good, The Bad, The Ugly\n                                                                                         |Review|\n\n\nThe good: \n\nIf you love playing cops 'n robbers in various areas of a city, crashing into shops and stealing loot or arresting criminals and returning the stolen goods this game is for you. On top of that you have a VERY detailed customization system that will keep you occupied as well as composing music when you die to making detailed symbols and pictures.\nA decent ammount of guns and equipment sets give you various different styles of gameplay and approaches to certain missions. If you want to take a break from the chaos of the city and just want to shoot people they have TDM maps where you can frag at your leisure. As one of my most played games in my library I found much enjoyment in this game and even though I go on hiatus from time to time I will find myself crawling back eventually.\n\n\n\nThe BAD: \n\nIts really a shame that Real time worlds (the original creators of the game) went bankrupt because they rushed a game that could of been something so much greater than what it is now. Even though it was brought back to life and handed over to some free to play company no one has ever heard of I was still glad it was given a second chance. From the start I had high hopes that GamersFrist would give this game some dignity and held that vision that some of the core developers of this game had. However even for as long as they have had the game you can't notice much change in the game itself. Yes they have events but its just mission events that really don't mean anything, its just regular missions painted in what ever holiday it happens to be. Also there used to be a good rapport between the GF and the gaming community. Maybe that has changed but since then but I left when we didn't hear a world from our devs and were swimming in problems...\n\n\nThe FRIGGIN' UGLY:\n\nOf course free to play comes at a cost. How are they going to fund this game and create more content for the players and make this game better? Microtransactions. A concept on paper that really (at least in my opinion) seems harmless. But when a company MAINLY focuses on the content for thier in game shop you begin to see the true colors of what thier intent is. With little to almost nonexistant game updates, content and almost some new item every week in the in game store you can notice that either... \n\nA) someone is having money trouble\nB) Cash cow circle jerk\n\nThis game to me was a work of art and gave me so much fun and enjoyment that I wish thier marketing schemes didn't get to me. If you think i'm bullshiting you just look at thier facebook account. THERE IS BARLEY ANY OTHER POSTS OTHER THAN ADVERTISEMENTS FOR THIER SHOP ITEMS. Zero bullshit go look...\nAll this makes the player not want to even log in... Its that obnoxious. But I get it, you got to make some money. But how about make the game more enjoyable, make the gamers keep coming back and of course they'll buy something. Don't pray on the very few people in your community that spends hundreds of dollars on in game items. \n\nTHIS. IS. WHAT. MAKES. YOU. SO. DAMN.

The low population and broken ranking system will ensure that certain notorious individuals will become your personal arch nemeses. The laughable price point at which gear is pushed by the marketting department will have you cringing. The way in-game money makes people insane will have you questioning your own friends' intentions and paranoia will haunt your every financial decision.

There's a story behind each contact, and the relationships between the contacts begin to form as you rise through the ranks.\n+ The weapons and clothing (no armor, per say) really do set you in the mood of a city that breeds anarchy and violence.

Regardless of what computer you're on, you still seem to lag out and drive right into a wall, or run right into a room full of baddies. Eventually coming back to full connection dead and respawning.\n- Hackers. Oh my. Hackers. There are times when they get confused with people who pay to win, but I'll get to that. There are massive ban waves that the moderators do to wipe all hackers that they detect. However, it's an IP ban, which means simply changing your IP address will let you back in. I believe it's the three strike rule, and then your character is deleted from that game. Regardless, for every one good player there are two hackers, and they usually farm kills on low-level servers.\n- The leveling system (Reputation/Threat). This system is flawed, I believe, as when you start out you get a letter \"T\" next to your name. This stands for Trainee, and that's where it ends. There is no closed tutorial, as you are learning from a menu that tells you what to do in the active game. No training wheels, kiddies, because you could go into matchmaking as a trainee and get paired against a gold or two, and be completely destroyed. This wouldn't be as frustrating as it is, if the system wouldn't go by threat level. It doesn't detect threat level until after 5-10 matches of pure hell and dying, which is what usually drives people away.\n- Pay to Win. Finally, we're here. Considering this game is F2P, I was overjoyed when I first entered. I looked past my many starting matches and hoped that I would eventually find something that I could latch onto and love...I was wrong. The guns and outfits for normal players are nice, and take a while to get (A while is doing repetitive missions for the same contact until you unlock that tier), buying from the ARMAS Marketplace is 10x better. I played for 40 hours normal, and I was struggling at best on a Bronze server. Bronze. Only a step up from Green when are literally entering servers.

This game is beyond repair. Incompetent developers, as well as publishers, have let this game slip into decadence. Updates to this game are very little; often just minor bug fixes and occasionally a new weapon which is typically only able to be unlocked by paying for it with real money. Developers have constantly teased the playerbase with an alleged engine update, which has been in the \"works\" for almost three years, which has had progress shown twice.\n\nWhen players said that APB: Reloaded is pay to win, I often brushed them off and called them a crybaby. But now that I look back at this game, I see really how pay to win this game was. Having premium (boost to your XP and cash gain) halves the cooldowns of your abilities such as Field Resupply, taking the powerful ability from a two minute cooldown to a measly one minute cooldown. Not paying for premium also greatly hinders your customization capabilities, aswell as progression as a player. Getting to the higher ranks level gains slow to a crawl, and the grind demands extreme amounts of time.\n\nDon't be fooled by the seasonal events, they've been in the game for years. The christmas event has been in the game for almost 4 years now, and has reappeared each time with nothing changing. The same thing applies to other events, nothing has changed. We haven't seen the release of a new map since the literal release of the game.\n\nSo, do I recommend this game? Hell no. Don't come near this god awful shipwreck of a game. It should have stayed dead when Realtime Worlds shut the game down in 2010. Instead, it was revived and used as a method of taking the money from every single weeaboo and furry to ever lay eyes upon this festering pile of refuse.

After watching it \"evolve\" over time I have come to this conclusion about APB and its design. I will try to stay the concise points for easy reading.\n-   Designed to promote negativity between players (yes the game is PVP however they make no genuine effort to promote teamwork and community building between players)\n-   Missions are 50% easily one sided, 25% one sided based upon player tallents, and only 25% resonably balanced based on the objectives themselves.\n-   Developement is focused more toward re-releasing the original game content for a cash fee than resolving long standing issues and design flaws.\n-   They have been gradually improving the player threat system so it more accurately reflects a persons skill.\n-   The one truly good feature for the game is the character and vehicle design system that allows a high level of customization of look by use of symbols.\n-   Vehicle driving and performance is what you would expect from any game.\n-   Gun mechanics are sloppy and often glitchy. They add unneeded features in a failed attempt to balance weapons.\n-   Limited options for PVP play, you either do missions which have a standard theme or do Fight Club which is basically a moshpit of players killing players with a mission objective of some basic sort.\n-   Developement has issues with breaking things when adding or making \"improvements\" slow to never fix issues and glitches.\n\nOverall the game is poorly maintained, poorly developed, and has a good concept with a few nice features.

Before that they state it is always running and updates without giving any notice to you which btw anyone who has installed APB before knows it installs a punkbuster windows service that runs all the time in the background unless you manually disabled it.

Do you want to become a criminal, and just go to town on a city full of innocent people with riches worth taking, and start massive riots against the police and government? Do you want to be a peacekeeper, and  maintain order in a broken city by breaking criminal operations and protecting the innocent? Then what the F*** are you doing playing APB Reloaded? This game is NONE of what it looks like on the surface. After putting more hours than I'm ever thought I would, I can say I can make a worthwhile review.\n\nLet's weigh the Pro's and the Con's\n\nPro's:\n\n*The game, for a free-to-play, is very good looking. The graphics as far as shadowing and detail goes are top-notch.\n\n*The Character Customization is outstanding. You can literally make whatever you want, within reason. But this can also lead to some bad stuff. See Con's for more info.\n\n*The game has regular seasonal events for Easter, Halloween and Christmas. These game modes, sans Easter, are mainly in the Arena \"Fight Club\" mode where certain things have been changed to fit the season. The Christmas one is especially good.\n\n*The game has a very large variety of guns, but more can be said about this in the Con's.\n\n*The game does offer variety to activities depending on the faction that you choose. Criminals can do different things than Enforcers and vice-versa\n\n*There are several instances to play in, so you never really feel left out.\n\n\nCon's:\n\n*The game is a powerhouse to run. Most PC's won't even be able to handle it, and the \"low\" settings don't really help. Most people have to use community made mods to lower the settings down even further than the game allows just to play it. That isn't entirely something that's in GamersFirst's control, but the idea that an outside party mod has to be active for some people to even play is a bit offputting.\n\n*The game has seriously unstable connection problems. Countlessly, you will be lagged out of districts, and while you're in the server, you will be bouncing all over the place trying to get a grip on where you're going, only to shoot back several rooms because the server couldn't keep up. This is a glaring issue, and only exacerbates other problems.\n\n*One such problem includes actually landing shots on enemies. This game has some of the most inconsistant damage I've ever seen in a game, and the shot registration is abysmal. You will find yourself losing gunfight after gunfight simply because the other person is better connected to the server than you, or his gun suddenly does more damage than before. Sometimes, your gun will kill someone in 4 shots, and the next person you shoot takes 9-10 shots to put down. This whole game can be summed up as \"Inconsistant.\" That's the bottomline.\n\n*Just because there's a lot of guns, doesn't mean they're all different. There are a lot of guns that function exactly like other guns. The Joker Carbine acts just like the STAC-10. The NTEC acts just like the AR-15. This doesn't even touch on the Snipers. Quite literally, the guns are recycled and released to the public for actual money, where they act just like the last gun they sold. This one just looks different.\n\n*There is a large pay-to-win gap in this game. Most guns can be earned in-game, and some guns can even be made permanent. However, most of the time, you'll be renting leased weapons, and these will only last up to 7 days. Some guns you have to actually pay to make them permanent. This is also an issue in the \"Premium\" system, where if you pay for a set amount of time, you gain more money and experience toward your standing. While this isn't too bad and is nowhere near as bad as some other games doing this, it's still a bit unfair to the people just getting into the game.\n\n*The game is very confusing at first, and there is no good tutorial. The way it works is, when you start, you have to gain up reputation with certain people to gain rewards, raise your standing with them to get more rewards, and to increase your threat. The higher your win/loss ratio in missions is, the better your threat is. The three primary tiers are Bronze, Silver, and Gold. There are also ranks within that. Nowhere in the game is this explained to you, or at least explained well. You will have no idea what you're doing for a long while.\n\n*The game has horribly unbalanced matchmaking. More often than not, you will be pitted against people who are far better armed, skilled and familiar with the map than you are, and you will be shut down again and again, because the game will refuse to give you people around your  level. Your reputation, Threat, or overall level does not affect who you will get matched up against. I have seen Bronze players go up against Gold players and get utterly annihilated. This kind of thing is far from fair.\n\n*The game has one of the absolute worst communities I have ever seen on a MMO, no, a GAME before. The people on this game range from little kids screaming about how bad you are in the chatbox, to grown men whining and complaining about weapons and tactics you're using. And GOD HELP YOU if you're a Bronze or a Silver on this game. To be a Gold, is to be the scum of the earth in most cases. Golds constantly and consistantly berate Silvers and Bronzes for the most mundane of reasons, and will go out of their way to make your time on this game as unpleasant as possible. Very few people will actually answer any questions you have about the game while playing, and are more likely to make fun of you for not knowing than just telling you. This Con is the most deciding of why this game just isn't worth the time.\n\n*Because of the community being as disgusting as it is, this brings up a very big issue in the Character Customization. With the massive scale in which you have control over your character, comes every negative you can think of to compromise it. You will constantly see fat black men with giant, often neon colored, afros in limited to almost no clothing at all running around, or you may even see Adolf Hitler running around. This is also a problem with the fact that the naming system for your characters is unrestricted, so racial and offensive names are abundant. For every good costumed character running around, there's a \"TyroneFriedChicken\" to muck it all up.\n\n*While the game likes to parade the idea of \"FairFight\" around like it's some form of trophy, the game is still overrun with hackers. With constant new hacking tools emerging every time another is addressed, you'll constantly see this as an issue. And while the response time to have them removed permanently from the game is rather quick(Most of the time), it's still the fact that they're there in the first place that makes this a problem.\n\n\nIn closing, APB Reloaded is an ex-pay to play MMO shooter with subpar action and goofy as hell ragdoll physics. But it's a dying game, and with the community punching more and more holes in the sinking boat that is this game, and further alienating and shunning new players, it will eventually sink completely. I can not recommend this game to anyone with the condition that it's in.

The choice is yours.\n\n-END OF THE EDIT-\n\n\nBack a few years ago I would have told you to buy this game and enjoy it. Recenlty however the company has fallen to some very shady practices and secrecy, in game the NA server has about only 300 players (NA is also composed of South America since there is not Latin server) I've heard the EU servers are better but i've no desire to look into it personally and grind characters up to higher levels after spending almost 3000 hours in this game to get where I was. Circling back to the shady practices the most blatant is on their forums for the game itself, they are systematically DELETING posts that pose questions to the developers asking them to be more upfront and open about what they are doing with the game and emails are flat out ignored as far as I can tell. It began back in 2015 with the announcment that the game would recieve an update to the newest (at that time) Unreal Engine this date kept getting moved back further and further till they just stopped talking about it and as stated earlier if you ask about it on the forums the post is outright deleted without any reason for it. \n\nIt is a shame to see a game with so much potental and in my opinion the BEST character / car creation and customization the sky was literally the limit when I came to that... yea there was a bit of a pay wall for the ammount of detail on some things but a 10 dollar fee ONCE if you could nail a look and you'd be able to have an icon and amazing look for your toon. Frankly that is a controversial thing aswell where others say the micro transactions are too much (for the guns they kind of were $25 for a skin for a gun you could get in game), they really weren't, many games make their money this way in a F2P game micro transactions are how the games stay alive, LoL, DOTA, Fortnite all of these free to play they make their money of off the cosmetics and subscriptions that give boosted XP and Money which really isn't that big of a boost in the long run. This being said the most recent things have gotten out of control where I find myself thinking they care more about quick cash grabs (loot boxes, reskins, cosmetics) than the game itself which reflecting and looking at the decline of the game and the company behind it... this is clearlythe case.\n\nTo summarize, if you download this game and can actually get past the terrible GMing (haven't seen one of them in forever either), greedy company, toxic player base, and bugs (those were a special quirk to many of us who played the game for years), then you will generally have a good time, get a few friends to playand maybe build up the player base to a point that makes G1 ACTUALLY give a crap again, otherwise you're just sitting upon a horse that is well past dead and I wish you the best luck. To those of you that still play from all those years ago I congratulate you for being able to suffer G1 longer than i can, \n\nSince they did delete my message on the forums I leave this little piece here. This is a message to G1 and Tiggs herself (doubtful she cares enough to read things here). *ahem* Would you please man up and give us some transparency... the shadowy nature of your practices are what are killing this game and the community. You need to grow up and quit exploiting people because if this game fails you and your company will have little comeback even with the other titles (most of which are failing) under your belt. If you have no desire to keep the game alive PROPERLY do those of us a favor who love the game, END IT or sell it to someone who cares.\n\nLeonAnders Joker OG .... Signing off for the last time...

The playerbase is full of venomous, toxic people. Should you get involved with the community, you can expect DDoSers, griefers and undesirable people to bother you.\n\nMechanically speaking, APB does not in any way play like any other shooter. Many people will pick up an assault rifle, press right mouse and hold down the trigger, which rarely works. The gunplay sits solely around extremes, there are no in-betweens like in most shooters, which I personally find silly. Only shotguns and SMGs will be found in close quarters. Only snipers, semi-autos and (sometimes) assault rifles will be found in long range. You have to frequently change guns depending on the environment, which can be an extreme problem if you don't have premium, because there is a lengthy cooldown for the ammo box which can be used for changing guns and re-stocking. The only way to negate that long cooldown is to own premium.\n\nThe matchmaking is also hopelessly broken, and veterans will be placed against new players.\n\nAPB also suffers from a item shop dilemma. There are certain guns that are extremely potent, which can only be purchased via the armas market. Originally, you could outgun the OCA whisper or the CSG, but now there are pocket SMG guns, such as the Oca Nano, the extremely high ROF SMG that can be used like a rifle that is the ACES gun, so on and so forth. They aggressively market their items and don't even attempt to make a F2P variant that can compare.\n\nThe Developers are not only ridiculously greedy, but they also lack any talent. Most content is re-hashed or has minimum effort applied to it. Bug fixes are slow to happen. They've done nothing to fix the rampaging numbers of cheaters which have plagued the game since beta, aside from occasionally catch someone who's too blatant, or false ban someone who may be godly good at the game. On the subject of bans, a developer has come out and flatly said that all bans are final and that they are cheaters, no matter what.\n\nThe only redeeming qualities I could even offer is that the customization is unmatched, the vehicle play is a fascinating idea and the open world missions are a great idea, but could certainly use a lot of tweaks at later level missions.\n\nI personally believe it may be too late to save APB, and that it should be sold to another company so that the customization can be harvested for a much better game.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1388566414, "timestamp_updated": 1388566414, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 89, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.67256087064743042", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25391076": {"recommendationid": "25391076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094517450", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 36051, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489999065}, "language": "english", "review": "Its like cocaine, you know its terrible for you, but you still play it.", "timestamp_created": 1473221996, "timestamp_updated": 1473221996, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 31, "weighted_vote_score": "0.70221555233001709", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43481754": {"recommendationid": "43481754", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014789760", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 43242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496516354}, "language": "english", "review": "Update: New dev bought the game, implementing battleeye. \nHopefully they can save it.\n\nIt's hard to give this game a No. \nI've played this more than any other game since Ultima Online, and had the most fun too. \nPopulation is all but gone now.
