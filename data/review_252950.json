If you are looking for sports game but getting bored of casual football or basketball games, then you should give Rocket League a try, you probably will like it. This game is all about skill and teamwork, other things won't affect your win (except your network, of course)\n\nThe second one is the customization, there are tons of items for your car and millions combination that you can try (but you know, most items can only be obtained by getting random drops, or opening the crates with key that you need to buy or by trading with other players. However, you don't need to have those expensive items to be the best in this game.  You can play with standard Octane that you got from the beginning and become the Grand Champ if you got what it takes.\n\nThe third one is the community, I know that you will find so many different people in this game, trash talker, noob, ball chaser, but still, there are still good people. I did find some of them, and they showed me how to get better in this game. Other than that, custom training is there for you, created by the community of Rocket League.\n\nHowever, most people say that the server is suck, but i don't agree 100% with them. Most of the time i played smoothly, no problem. But it doesn't mean i never encountered any problem during online play. Well the server is not perfect, but it's not that bad. I still got ping spikes in some server, but most servers are good. So basically you need to double check your connection first before blaming Psyonix for the server. \n\nOverall, this game is a must try for you guys. I'm going to give 8.8/10 for this game. I got addicted to be honest. I've been spending more than 900 hours in this game so you could tell how much i love to play this one.", "timestamp_created": 1550071471, "timestamp_updated": 1550071471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632803261280059814", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49124641": {"recommendationid": "49124641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010309360", "num_games_owned": 2026, "num_reviews": 123, "playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 152, "last_played": 1551635527}, "language": "english", "review": "Good.

If you make a single mistake, your whole team will degrade you. Casual is the way to go. Psyonix should for sure make it easier to ban/report people who choose to be toxic to anyone. I understand that there\u2019s toxicity in every online game, but every other match there\u2019s some sort of bullshit going on in the chat, whether to you or someone else. One time I ranked up from a Plat 2 div 1 all the way up to a Plat 3 div 3 due to all the forfeited matches (Furthering on the amount of toxic players)\nIn summary: If you want a casual game, don\u2019t play rocket league.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention the gameplay, the overall game is actually very fun, hence the almost 600 hours I\u2019ve put into it. The community is toxic, just like any other game. Turn off chat/ignore your team, but that goes to show how toxic the game is and it could ruin your performance in a match because you need to communicate with your team. I\u2019m not recommending it only because of the community, but the actual game is very well done and enjoyable.

You will need lots and lots of playtime, maybe some practice, and trial-and-error sessions, if you want to improve ; but in the end the more you play the more you enjoy the game. You come for the entertainment and you stay to master the tool between your hands.\n\nThe competitive modes are in my opinion the soul of the game.

It looks silly at first, but after playing a few games by yourself, you start to really feel the magic and soon you'll be chanting \"one more game!\" With that, here is my completely unbiased review of my favorite game in the world: \n\nPros: \n1. Awesome Competitive Scene, while still being accessible to new players \n2. 'Easy to Learn, Hard to Master' - game has an infinite skill cap and great replayability\n3. Entertainment value is through the roof! $20 and it's the most played game in my library and many others\n4. Gameplay, controls and mechanics are all really solid (imo, best on controller)\n5. Is very enjoyable, whether you are coop, solo, casual or competitive\n\nCons: \n1. Game is beautiful but graphically dated. Game is lacking a proper AA and texture detail. \n2. Game servers can sometimes appear to lag for everyone in the game. This has been pretty minor for me, but something others reviewers have brought up. \n\nOther comments: \n1. People report that the community is toxic. Yes, there are toxic people of every rank, who will say things that will make you want to uninstall RL forever. There's also a host of super cool, super chill dudes and dudettes that are out to have a good time, win or lose. \n2. Personally, I think the matchmaking in ranked is pretty fair and I haven't noticed what other reviewers are saying about the matchmaking being horrible. Sure, there's smurfs and the occasional bad match up - just like any game - I think Psyonix has done a good job of limiting smurf and bad ranked matches with recent updates.  \n3. There are loot crates and 'season' passes you can spend real money on. I personally don't care about this, as there is no mandatory or \"pay to win\" DLC \n4. Many reviewers talk about special modes becoming ranked (i.e. Rumble). For the most part, I only play standard ranked and casual games, so I have no comment, this has not impacted the core RL experience for me. \n\nIf you're looking for a game that's an entertaining, an easy to pick up, couch coop, Rocket League is your game. If you're looking for a game with infinite skills to learn and master, Rocket League is your game. If you're looking for a hardcore competitive e-sport that stretches you, Rocket League is your game. If you have major doubts about the fun you could be having playing this game RIGHT NOW, buy it and you won't have to doubt anymore! \n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1550110769, "timestamp_updated": 1550110769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49357767": {"recommendationid": "49357767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198832674763", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2272, "last_played": 1551748879}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun looking forward to a new car maybe another fast and furious car the amp car :P", "timestamp_created": 1551718008, "timestamp_updated": 1551718008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49354434": {"recommendationid": "49354434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198918590880", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 200, "last_played": 1551446328}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game.

I would consider myself an experienced player being ranked at champion 2 in doubles with roughly 2,000 hours on the game (500 on steam and 1,500 on xbox), so i am suitable to write a review for this game. Rocket League is fun simply because you can find fun in it without friends like most games. Dont get me wrong, playing this with just one other friends makes the experience much much better. New updates adding more content come out more often than you would think. Now The real question is: should you buy this game and is it worth your money. The answer to the first question is very difficult because it doesnt depend at all on what type of games you like. I pretty much only played shooters before rocket league, and nothing else. What i say to it is to just try out the game with some friends so you get the full experience. Answering the second question, is it worth the money..... its 20 bucks. All in all, a sort of starter guide would be to play with a friend, and dont take it seriously at all, but try to win at the same time, have fun.

It's unique, the physics are wonky but predictable, and the entire game play experience is great. If you wanted to hear the good, then stop reading here, because crap takes a turn for the worse in this game quickly.\n\nThat being said the actual players make this game almost unplayable. Hop in a random match with cross platform play enabled and you get stuck with a team of PS4 players who can't play the game, you lose miserably and learn nothing as you scramble to fix their mistakes. PS4 players get the game free with their PS membership, so you have a lot of new players all the time hopping on and the teams are horrible when cross platform play is enabled. Hop in a game without cross platform play and you find groups of players who would rather trash talk then play the game, let alone help your team. Just today I watched a team mate finish a goal and then watched another team mate refuse to play the rest of the match while continuously trash talking both me and his other team mate. It's hard to want to play a game where that's common, and it's common. Hop on competitive, first error a team mate or yourself make and you can watch at least one team mate leave the game immediately.\n\nToo be clear, I want to love this game. I like sports games. I like racing games. I like PvP, but Rocket League is broken. I know they're trying to fix it. I know they put bans in place and they brag about their automatic ban system, but the community is still the community and it's horrible.

I literally lost all respect and simpathy for the game.\nUnless you are ready to buy like 4 copies for a couple of friends of yours, do not buy it. This is the most CUCKED game I have ever played, let me elaborate.\n\nI really loved the game back then, I didn't search it, it came to me as a gift. I kinda regret coming this far.\n\nThe idea, graphics and music are 10/10, the problem? This is no longer a enjoyable game.\nAt the beginning this was a real ESport, only skills matter. Right now it's just a total kinder playground safe zone lets gamble and buy seasonal pass game. Everything is a trigger, you cannot longer really interact to your team if you are just paired with people online, and be ready to literally lose an entire match just for telling someone on your team to go for the ball. The game is totally playable (almost) without any purchase at all, except the game itself (DIN DIN) but you will realize the game seems off.\nThe community is ok, every competitive game has it's toxic people, but the game has a problem where the Devs are trying to adjust it to become less and less humane so you can be just another car, because if, you have something to say, you will probably get a ''Chat disabled'' message anyway. Are you trying to congratulate a friend of yours? Get another ''Chat Disabled'' message. \nI am not even close to get banned, but since everything is a trigger now, I most probably will in a future, so Imagine buying a game just to get banned (not my type of game nu huh), the game seems dead off playing in literal mute all the time. I would have better play with the AI and pretend I am interacting with people online. Your own team won't even tell what you are trying to do because ''Chat disabled''.\n\nIt was once a game, now it is pathetic, I honestly think so. You might not really get what I am trying to tell you unless, you play the game, after just ONE match I am sure you will say ''Ahhh yeah this is what he was talking about''\n\nYou can still play it, but it wont be any fun. This is a no fun zone, only ''Pay seasonal pass, and become a robot to play'' zone. \n\nTLDR\nUnless you are playing with your friends, in a closed game, and probably even not, you can have some fun on this game.

The game is absolutely incredible. It gets your adrenaline pumping and your heart racing in the moment. Then it can just as quickly take it away and leave hollow disappointment when you miss that goal or you fail to block that shot.\n\n. The graphics aren't terrible. For those of you ( like me! ) who are into the higher end graphics, with taxing games such as ARK: Survival Evolved, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands, Anthem, and more this game will be a bit of a strain on the eyes with the classy, flashy graphics. While they certainly suit the game nicely, they might now be everyone's cup of tea.\n\n. Gameplay is fast paced, exciting, and fun. It's one of those games that's affordable to the common gamer, and you can easily play with friends. Especially with the new cross - platform party update recently ( this review written 2/21/19 ), you can even play with friends, regardless what size screen or graphical settings they're limited to ;)\n\nCons - \n\n. As a lot of other reviews have mentioned, the community. While the game itself is certainly worth the asking price, I'm not quite sure it's worth the drama. Simply put, if you've been playing the game a while, and already invested time, effort, and possibly money, it's worth holding on to and carrying on. If you're new to the scene, it's worthwhile taking a second take.\n\n. Cheaters. Every game has cheaters, let's be honest. But Rocket League seems to bring a whole new tier to the meaning. Playing for the first few levels ( I'm currently level 44 ), the game seems fine. With the vile, rude, and toxic players aside you seem to have a fairly honest win / loss ratio relative to your skill. If you pick the game up quickly you'll be staring at victory after victory and the air horns will be singing your name. Vice versa, you could be looking at the darker \"defeat\" screen more often that one would like. Or, if you're like me you'll have a nice balance of both. Entering around mid-game however, the cheaters begin to emerge. Teleporters, aimbotters, players utilizing anything from lag switches to sticky cars begin to emerge. At first it can easily be dismissed as a bad match, but carrying on you'll notice players hitting the ball without boost towards their own goal, or towards an abstract wall only to seconds later have it flying into yours. Players who touch the ball, then have it \"stick\" to their car as they dive your goal over and over, hitting the ball with your own car resulting you flying off into space. Moments when you suddenly freeze, then un-freeze after a goal's been scored. ( my network ping is just fine, and all other games result in no similar issues. Drivers are up to date, etc. ) This repeats itself match after match so often it almost becomes humorous. I hope you get the picture.\n\nSummary / Verdict - \n\nI believe there are better games out there.", "timestamp_created": 1550775305, "timestamp_updated": 1550775305, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.4375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48828731": {"recommendationid": "48828731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198882538868", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 976, "last_played": 1551827002}, "language": "english", "review": "Worst Games Ive Ever Played.

At first, just driving car to ball is a challenge, but as your skill grows, the freedom to create any play you can imagine and execute is unlike anything you'll find in a \"sports game\". Together with the mechanical skill to do what you want with the ball, you'll have to develop positional awareness and learn proper rotation and game sense. \n\nThere are very few games that are consistently rewarding for hundreds or thousands of hours, that can keep challenging you as you improve, and improve, and improve beyond what you ever imagined you'd be capable of.

You are a disgrace to your team and the game.\n\n[b]Semi Pro[/b] - You can now sometimes hit the ball. Don't even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning. You're only Semi Pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball! You also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah you're still shit.\n\n[b]Pro[/b] - You have learnt how to shoot the ball accurately from the ground. You're the best! Late into Pro level, you would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League. Worst mistake of your life. You now know what aerials are. You think you can fly. The ball comes up high and you go for an aerial. Once you jump, you fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back... What the fuck happened there? Oh. You're using keyboard. Yeah nah, time to get a controller, dick-head.\n\n[b]Veteran[/b] - You now have a controller and go for terribly unlikely aerials. You think you're good. You can hit the lower aerials consistently and you can now be considered an addition to your team. Congratulations!\n\n[b]Expert[/b] - You can now consistently hit aerials accurately at any height. This game is now your life. You can also score off a wall every now and then. Good times.\n\n[b]Master[/b] - You are now a god to every level lower than you. You have perfected the art of wall shots. You are an extremely cool person. A nice little bonus is that everyone under the level of Pro will now spam \"Sorry!\" every time they do something wrong to you.\n\n[b]Legend[/b] - The most badass-looking title you can have. Fuck Rocketeer. You probably now have an extreme case of false confidence. Once you get used to the badass title, you'll wreck anything and anyone with ease. You can also pull off freestyles consistently. Nice job! Also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of \"You're not good enough for Legend!\"\n\n[b]Rocketeer[/b] - You can now 720-freestyle-backflip-reverse-backwards-aerial-air dribble off a wall with ease. You probably boosted for that Rocketeer tag. But if you didn't, still prepare for another endless stream of \"You're not good enough for Rocketeer!\"\n\nBut in all seriousness, I absolutely love this game and I'm sure anyone will. I've literally never seen someone dislike this game after they've played 10 hours. (Rocket League moves onto a whole-nother level of fun and addiction once you learn how to fly.)\n\nIf you're still contemplating buying this game after reading this review, just trust me when I say it is one of the most fun and addictive games I've ever played (more gripping than Skyrim and GTA). \nThink about it this way: You wouldn't have made it this far through the review if you didn't secretly want this game. Ignore the childish-looking pictures on the store page. Just get this game. This is the one.\n\n[h1]EDIT - 2/13/2016:[/h1] You know a game is amazing when the servers go down and you'd rather train offline than play any of your other 100 games... \n\nty for the read", "timestamp_created": 1452517414, "timestamp_updated": 1511863677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2068, "votes_funny": 2013, "weighted_vote_score": "0.941781103610992432", "comment_count": 194, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17006912": {"recommendationid": "17006912", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977314227", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 32052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545046134}, "language": "english", "review": "4 player split screen? cross platform connectivity? rocket cars?

I have it for free on PS4 and bought it on steam to play with friends.\n\nThe game is a ton of fun. The gameplay is easy to learn, hard to master.\nGraphics are pretty nice and cars come with a ton of costumization options (FOR FREE).\nWe can face AI opponents with diferente skill levels (that can make a huge diference) or we can play vs players usually with simillar skill (sometimes u can face players really better than u but their in game rate is the same or lower than yours).\nThere are several game modes but the only major difference is the amount of players and ranked match or not.\nIts great to play with friends. Hard to quit playing even if you're really tired.\nI seriously recomend using a controller. I use my DS4 with Bluetooth (using inputmapper) and it works perfectly. For ppl using other controllers i recomend x360ce (helped 2 friend who were using a ds2 and a sega saturn controller).\n\nA word also for the devs that seem to work night and day to fix problems.

Rocket League was out for a long time - steam had been trying to get me to buy it through numerous sales and recommendations based on similar games. I put it off again and again, despite friends telling me that this game is amazing/unbelievable. I scoffed when I saw RL esports on BTsports one saturday morning as I skipped through the channels on my TV, what a joke I thought. football with cars...it sounds stupid.\n\nI can tell you now, I am an idiot for not listening to everyone. This game is amazing. I don't think there is another game that I have played that so consistently gets you pumped. There is a degree of toxicity in the game caused by the fact that everyone seems to think they are the next Kronovi/Squishy. it is such a simple game but at the same time there is so much complxity to it.\n\nIn it's simplest form the aim of the game is to get the ball into the other teams goal; here are the controls. accelerate, brake/reverse, jump and boost. You play a few games and think yeah this is alright. Then someone \"pro\" will join your game and air dribble the ball over your head into goal or a skilled team will pass the ball from goal to scoring without the ball touching the ground. Because you are new you are just like.....\"wtf just happened\" and it's at that moment you realise...the cars have wings(if you have the skill to control it.) and the boost isn't just to get you around on the ground quicky. You'll give it a bash, the ball will sail through the air you jump, you boost, you fail on an epic scale. Now you get spammed with \"what a save!\" because your lack of ability was clearly apparent and your team mates are more than happy to point out who is exactly to blame for any and all mistakes. \n\nTo sum up, I think Rocket League might be the best game I have ever played, once you've got past the steep and seemingly never ending learning curve and start making amazing team plays you will understand what I mean. It's even good as a spectater sport. like I said I scoffed when I saw it on BTsports. Now I watch most of the RLCS on Twitch.\n\nBuy this game, you will not be disappointed....for me this is a 10/10 - remember its a team game sometimes a pass is better than a shot!\n\nPro tip - stay out of ranked until you can hit at a minimum 100% on all star goalie training and 50% on earial all star training(they seem boring but honestly it is basic training that gives you a feel for controlling your car in the air and you will benefit from the mucle memory in matches)", "timestamp_created": 1525256686, "timestamp_updated": 1525256686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 120, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.898581087589263916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16936176": {"recommendationid": "16936176", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964757567", "num_games_owned": 883, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1531193246}, "language": "english", "review": "To give you an idea of how good this game is - I currently have 511 games in my Steam library, and this is the [i]only[/i] one I've gone out of my way to review. \n\nSARPBC (the PS3 predecessor to Rocket League) has been a favorite of my friends and I for... years. Literally years. We've put thousands of hours into it. It's one of those incredibly rare games that all of us are always keen to play because it's always fun. \n\nRocket League, I'm happy to say, is SARPBC with improved graphics and gameplay, better accessibility for new players, plus a ton of added options that give the game an extra layer of character. It's going to comfortably replace SARPBC in my top five games, all-time, across all genres. It's also replacing SARPBC as my absolute favorite multiplayer game - online or local. \n\n\n[b]Positive[/b]\n\n+ Fun, deep, brilliantly fast-paced gameplay\n+ Games are long enough to mean something, but short enough that a loss is never too frustrating.\n+ Games are almost never over until the final buzzer. Results can turn on a dime - and when they do, it's always because a player or team has stepped up, rather than any fault of or flaw with the game itself. \n+ The learning curve is fairly smooth, but the skill ceiling is also incredibly high. Despite the aforementioned years playing SARPBC, I still see players in Rocket League pulling off moves that I can only dream of.\n+ There's massive flexibility in how you play, more than any other game I know of. Offline with bots. Offline split-screen. Online. Online split-screen. Online split-screen with bots. 1 v 1 if you don't feel like playing on a team, or 2 v 2 / 3 v 3 / 4 v 4 if you do. And the game is just as suited to mano-a-mano matches as it is to team play, which is (again) a very, very rare quality.\n\n\n[b]Negative[/b]\n\n- The one slightly disappointing thing I'll mention is (at launch) the lack of variety in maps. SARPBC had a bunch of quite inventive, distinctive maps that forced different play styles and tactics. Rocket League's maps are aesthetically different, but structurally uniform. Luckily, word is that some 'crazier' maps will likely be arriving in the forthcoming free DLC.  I'm still thoroughly enjoying what's already there, but some extra variety in that regard will definitely be welcome.\n\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nIf the idea of fast-paced soccer (sans rules) with cars even vaguely appeals to you, get this game immediately.

You then start to forget about where you came from and whether or not you even liked the damn game to begin with. You slowly then being training every day before work or school, practicing aerials and dribbling in free play mode. The ball slowly becomes a part of you. You become the rank of \"Pro\" and you're feeling pretty damn hot right now shit, even scalding. You slowly climb the ranks and descend into the madness that is rocket league. Then the itch starts.

Why?\n\n\nThe game's system is the best that i can imagine. Your advantage over other players isn't measured by how many hours you have, how many dlcs you got, or your level. It's measured by how much you've learned and perfected.\n\nYou start as a derp car that can't hit a ball 20ft above the ground. Then you keep playing against people of the same skill, until you see someone who can do some cool/pro/funky/op stuff, then you see his goals and you think: \"Wow, look at that shot, i must learn how to do it!\"        \n      Then in a matter of time, you learn how to do it and even do better.

If you use a controller, you will not have an advantage against who uses a keyboard and vice-versa.\n\nThe graphics are nice, you can play it with a microwave using low graphics, or a medium computer on max graphics with a solid 60 fps. They could be better though (?)\n\nThe levels normally represent your skill very well if you aren't a lot above-average or below-average, with a Rookie playing like a rookie and a legend playing like a legend.

It doesn\u2019t need complex progression or diverse player choices to keep it fun, it\u2019s just fun as it is. You\u2019ve got fast rocket-powered cars that can jump or fly around and you use them to knock a ball into your opponent\u2019s goal. That\u2019s all there is to the core gamemode. It is so rare these days that a game with an idea this basic actually ends up being a fully fledged successful title. Rocket League is a great change of pace and it has earned a lot of respect from me. \n\nRocket League\u2019s main gamemode \u201cSoccar\u201d, as Psyonix likes to call it, is certainly a simple idea that anyone can get into, but it is in no way easy. The controls in this game are easy to learn, they work well and are fluid, but learning how to properly maneuver your vehicle in order to hit a moving ball at the right angle to get it to go where you want is another story entirely. If you\u2019re playing Rocket League you\u2019ve likely played other racing games and understand the basics, but controlling a car in this manner is an incredibly unique experience. Even people who have hundreds of hours in ranked played still fail to properly control their car, especially as they\u2019re flying through the air. It is definitely a game that encompasses the idea of easy to learn, hard to master. \n\nWhile the standard Soccar gamemode is certainly the most well known and commonly played, it isn\u2019t actually the only thing Rocket League has to offer. First I should note that Soccar does have some slight variants including 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, as well as ranked versions of each. The game has always had a solid competitive scene, so if that\u2019s your thing this is a good place for it. There are sorts of other less \u201cserious\u201d gamemodes as well. As Psyonix comes up with more fun things to do with rocket cars, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see even more added or rotated in. Currently there are Hockey and Basketball modes, which play much like how you\u2019d imagine they would with fast cars. There is also a chaotic 4v4 Soccar mode and a mode revolving around cooldown based powerups that can do crazy things like teleport switching with an enemy, or summoning a tornado to toss the ball and other cars around. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nRocket League is a fast-paced sports/racing game where quick reactions and planning are essential. Personally, I am not a big fan of most racing games and practically no sports games, however Rocket League really earns its own unique place around those genres. I would highly recommend just checking out a video or two from professional Rocket League tournaments, it should be quick to notice how some people are so passionate about playing and watching this game. \n\nIf you\u2019re not the competitive type, Rocket League still certainly has plenty to offer you. Either playing with friends in casual matches or privates matches against one another is an immense amount of fun. That can be said about many games, but you aren\u2019t going to find another game like this out there right now. It should also be noted that this is one of the few games out there that supports cross-platform matchmaking and parties. This has been the case to some degree for a long time, but just recently Sony finally loosened up on their terms for crossplay which means RL matchmaking is able to pool together players from every system.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe arenas in which you play in are all relatively small, this is not an open world game. For this reason, they are able to implement absolutely gorgeous arenas and backdrops while still maintaining very good performance across most computers. As time goes on Psyonix continues to add more beautifully themed maps, all of which essentially play out the same, but add some pleasant variety that make each match just that much more interesting. The maps aren\u2019t the only beautiful thing, they certainly didn\u2019t want their rocket cars to get jealous of their environment. All the different cars  perform practically the same, with only some slight difference in hitbox and handling. However there are such a wide amount of options that most anyone should be able to find one that they love to look at. There are many free or paid cosmetic options for car bodies, wheels, cute hats, or even things like boost trails or goal explosions!\n\n[h1]User Interface[/h1]\nThe UI is as sleek and sexy as the rest of the game. Psyonix continues to make improvements to it, but it has always been very well designed. It\u2019s easy and fast to get into whichever kind of match you\u2019d like. You can see news and patch notes ingame, and also easily see which song the ingame playlist is currently on. \n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nI believe most people would prefer to play this with a controller, and that\u2019s surely what it\u2019s mainly designed for. However, I have always played on Mouse and Keyboard and I\u2019ve never felt the controls to be awkward or difficult. Everything is easily rebindable as well on either control scheme. \n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nCar engines roaring, crowds cheering, goal horns blaring, what\u2019s not to love? All of the expected sound effects of a rocket powered soccer game are here, and they are quite satisfying. There are even some options for different engine or boost sounds for your car. \n\nMost of the music of Rocket League consists of EDM and other fast paced electronic style music, which is very fitting for the aesthetic of the game. The game has some solid original songs, as well as an increasingly large amount of options from other indie groups that fit into the game equally as well. In 2017 Monstercat also partnered with Psyonix allowing Rocket League to feature their new songs ingame via their very convenient \u201cRocket League Radio\u201d.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nRocket League is a game as much as it is a show. The style and implementation of the game allows for it to be a very strong esport due to the high skill ceiling and the excitement of watching it. As competitive as it gets, it also has plenty of fun to be had for even the most casual gamers out there. It\u2019s an incredibly unique game, and really stands alone outside of games from similar genres. This is the type of game that really will just come to someone\u2019s personal preference of whether they will play it or not. It isn\u2019t held back in any way by performance, or catering to only a specific audience, it\u2019s truly a game I believe that anybody can love. \n\n\n\n[i]If you appreciate this review and want to see more, please follow my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33350283/]Curator Page[/url].[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1541703344, "timestamp_updated": 1548803164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 122, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.874504029750823975", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17031343": {"recommendationid": "17031343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064661213", "num_games_owned": 902, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 9155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515351535}, "language": "english", "review": "Rocket League is a Football(Soccer) inspired sports game made by Psyonix. In this game you use a car to hit around a large ball into a goal, pretty much Football(Soccer) with cars. It might be the best game I've played this year so far.\n\nThere are a few different game modes, including online, Exhibition where you play against bots or your friends in local play, and a season mode where you play as a member on a team and you try and complete a season and win the championship. The game modes are fun, but not very different from each other. I do wish the Season mode was more like a Franchise mode in something like Madden, being able to control all the little things of your team, and having more stat tracking would make it a lot better, but its still worth a play or two.\n\nThe gameplay in this game is perfect. Once you figure out the flow to your car, how to use boosting properly, and how to track the ball, you'll realize just how addicing the game can be. Against bots or online, the game shines in its fun and addicting gameplay that adds a unique twist on the game of Football(Soccer). Learning the game comes quick, but mastering the techniques could easily take 30-50 hours of gameplay. \n\nYou have a large selection of cars and different things you can design them with. The speed and hitboxes are pretty much the same, so there isn't an optimal car to use, which is a great thing. All the different customization is basically cosmetic that does some minor stat tracking. I'm really happy they went this route, because you don't feel obligated to build your car based on some kind of metagame, you can customize it however you like it. \n\nBesides the season mode being kind of lacking, the only other complaint I had(notice, had), was the online. The first day I had it I couldn't play online at all, it just didn't work, and apparently until Saturday the online was pretty much broken. Thankfully, its been pretty much fixed, but I thought it would be an important point to mention. It is good that the developers showed commitment and actually fixed the problem, though.\n\nRocket League is an amazing game with addictive gameplay. I don't really get the people that say they don't like sports games, a lot of the gameplay and stat tracking in them is great, and this game is no exception.

I have been playing this game on PS4 since it's release date of July 2015. I've loved every second. (Well, maybe not EVERY second)\n\nSoccer with cars. I don't know how that concept works, but it does. Perfectly. Rocket League is the gold standard of a competitive sports game. It is super easy for anyone to just pick up a controller and play. The controls are simple, as well as the core gameplay. It's a great concept. Anybody can play it, but only when you take the time practicing to learn how to predict the ball, where to hit the ball to direct it, and how to fly is when the real game shines.\n\nThe customization in Rocket League is wonderful. Upon just starting, you're given few cars, decals, wheels, etc. As you play, more customization options are randomly unlocked upon completing a match. The ways you can customize cars is endless, with no two cars looking the same. The customization has no effect on the stats of each car, each is purely cosmetic. On the topic of stats, the bodies of each car do have individual stats. Hitboxes, turn radius, and acceleration times all become a factor when choosing a car that suits you. Microtransactions do exist in this game in the form of Crates. Much like CS:GO, you purchase keys to open said crates, which contain items from common to Exotic. Items in crates tend to be much cooler looking than the items that are included in the vanilla game, with moving decals and electric wheels being two of the many highlights. Fortunately, everything in these crates are purely cosmetic, meaning there is no Pay-to-win factor in Rocket League. I actually find myself buying these keys more often than in other games. This is probably the only game in which I have no problem supporting the developers, because they are doing such an amazing job.\n\nNow, onward to the gameplay, the most unique aspect of Rocket League. At its core, each match consists of two teams trying to score more goals into the opponents net to win. However, with the addition of boost and the ability to drive on walls, the game becomes much more than that. Pressing the jump button while in the air will propel your car into any direction you are moving, allowing you to hit the ball with a little more force. This mechanic is great for putting the ball where you want it to go, with direct control of where your car is. The driving in this game feels smooth and crisp, with a handbrake allowing very tight turns. Boost allows you to accellerate at a much quicker speed, and put more power into your shot. The boost mechanic really comes into play when the boost is used to thrust your car off the ground, turning your car into a rocket ship with wheels. This results in some truly beautiful shots and rewards the players who take the time to practice this move. Seeing somebody fly so gracefully toward the ball, smacking it into the net is just something so great that isn't found in other games. For newcomers, even hitting the ball can give satisfaction, and a narrow miss can make your heart skip a beat. After countless hours of playtime, I still find myself tensing up before a big hit.\n\nUpon scoring, the ball explodes into the net, throwing any player close enough accross the pitch. This is very satisfying, and it accompanied with a replay of the goal in slow motion, allowing you to see all of the glory (or B.S., in some cases). Quick chats are available such as \"Nice Shot!\" and \"Wow!\", although expect to get slightly tilted as \"What a save!\" will be spammed if you miss a save.\n\nTeams in Rocket League can have up to 4 players, with game modes of 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4. The 4v4 game mode is a little too chaotic for my liking (Which is probably why it is called 'chaos'). 2v2 and 3v3 are undoubtedly the best game modes, as this is where team play really shines. A pass to a teammate that leads to a goal (Even though it was probably not intentional) is a spectacular feeling, especially when shared with friends. There are also variations of these game modes, like Hoops, a basketball version of the game with hoops instead of goals. Snow Day, in which a hockey puck replaces the ball, and Rumble, where every 10 seconds you get a powerup ranging from a Glove to punch the ball and spikes that make the ball stick to your car. These game modes are fun from time to time, but I don't spend too much time playing them. The most recent addition, Dropshot, is undoubtedly the most fun game mode they have added. It consists of two teams of 3 and no goals. The objective is to smash the ball into the ground, causing the ground to take damage. Upon taking enough damage, the ground will open up, creating a goal for your team. Not only is this game mode fun as hell, it also serves as good practice for hitting those aerials.\n\nRocket League is one of those rare games in which a competitive mode is implemented into the game. Competitive has 4 game modes: Duel (1v1), Doubles (2v2), Standard (3v3), and Solo Standard (3v3, however no parties are allowed). Included with these game modes are ranks to measure your skill. The ranks range range from Bronze to Platinum to Champion. Within each rank are 3 sub-categories. For example, within Gold there is Gold I, Gold II, and Gold III, with I being the lowest and III being the highest. Furthermore, within these categories are divisions. Divisions range from I-IV, with IV being the highest. If you were to start out as Gold I division II, winning a game would bring you to division III, and the opposite for a loss. Once you pass division IV, you move up in categorym making you Gold II. During Season 3 of competitive play I managed to make it up to Champion, although it took lots of time and lots of patience. It's so addictive, you'll have yourself saying 'just one more game' after each match.\n\nAlso on the rise is the pro-league scene for Rocket League. We are about to enter the finals the the third season of the Rocket League Championship Series, with North America and Europe about to battle it out in the World Championships. Pro matches in Rocket League are unlike any other game. The teamwork and ball movement across the pitch are truly incredible. I highly recommend checking it out.\n\nUnfortunately, with all other competitive games, smurfs are an issue in Rocket League. It sucks, because you could be one win away from getting that new rank, and then a smurf comes and sets you back down a few divisions. Also, with the implementation of the new ranks in Competitive, there are many high level players being placed into really low ranks. This is not only unfair to the players who get ranked low, but to the people they play against. I'm hoping this issue gets fixed, but it seems to be a problem every time a new season begins.\n\nUpdates to this game are very frequent. New content is delivered almost monthly, with new maps, cars, game modes, and crates. The development team knows how to handle a game and keep their community happy, which is refreshing to see. The game sees new content every few months. The developers are constantly adding things to the game, keeping it fresh for its players. Not enough credit can be given to Psyonix and their development with the game. Rocket League couldn't be in better hands.\n\nSo, should you buy Rocket League? Absolutely. It is arguably the best game you can buy for under $20 right now. Rocket League is an extraordinary game. It's a game that I can constantly come back to, because it never gets repetitve. The mechanics are some of the best compared to similar games and with the competitve scene making a rise, I think this game will stick around for a long time.\n\nPROS:\n- Easy to pick up\n- Mechanics are phenomenal\n- Balanced\n- Microtransactions are purely cosmetic\n- Competitive play is implemented into the game\n- Customization is endless\n- Frequent updates\n- Good community\n- Never repetitive\n- Little to no bugs\n- Gameplay is just pure fun\n\nCONS:\n- Smurfs\n- Ranking system is messed up\n- \"What a save!\"", "timestamp_created": 1491598022, "timestamp_updated": 1494138061, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 127, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.857387721538543701", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43018615": {"recommendationid": "43018615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046418085", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 72644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1070, "last_played": 1551752682}, "language": "english", "review": "This game will seem frustrating for probably 99% of new players, but after putting the time in, it's proven itself to be the most exciting game I've ever played.

You know, those moments in time where you have too little time to play a really lengthy, story-driven game (or League of Legends), but way more time than you can feasibly sit and idle. It's as if our prayers were collectively answered with this fantastic game from Psyonix; Rocket League.\n\nTake out your controllers boys & girls, we're playing football....with cars.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nI've been playing games like Fifa and PES from the glory '98 days, but eventually my interests changed. After all, it was simply a game of football. There is only so much you can do with human players. Apparently Psyonix thought outside of the box. What they delivered was simply a stroke of genius. Gone were the human players we were accustomed to. Instead, rocket-powered cars jetted their way across the map in record speeds. This wasn't enough though. They altered the map, super-sized the ball, and set each player in control of only one car at a time.\n\nThis formula gave birth to the high-intensity game of Rocket League. Your goal is to hit the massive ball into the opponent's goal. Sounds simple enough right? Wrong. With rocket jumps, speed boosts, rocket-propelled flight and the unique map shapes, you'll find yourself in an endless chase at breakneck speed for possession of the ball. While this game is absolutely beginner friendly, it has an insanely high skill-ceiling. In other words, no matter how good you think you are, there is someone who is leagues above you.\n\nEach team can have up to 5 players, though the 3v3 format is the standard mode, and has a nice balance between chaos and fun. The potential teamwork between players is definiely one of my favourite aspects, and promotes friendly behavior for those epic goals. Don't be surprised if you get called out for accidentally hitting the ball away from the opponent's goal, or worse, hitting it into your own.\n\nQuick-chat commands are rather peaceful, but after seeing 3 censored swear words, you'll probably get the idea. The sarcastic tones of \"What a Save!\" upon scoring a goal always gives me a chuckle, and the genuine compliments from opponents is a welcome breath of fresh air, and pride.\n\nCar selection & customization should probably be a mini-game on its own. With a wide variety of colours, hats, boost trails and decals to choose from, you'll likely have more than a few saved presets that you'll cycle through. With an ever-growing roster of cars and cosmetics, there's plenty to appeal to everyone.\n\nSpeaking of appeal, there's much more than your classic game of football in Rocket League. Games such as basketball and hockey have found their way into the ever-growing list of game modes, and I often find myself cycling through them all quite frequently. Hell, even my 5 year old cousin loves it. Think you've got the skills to make it higher? You'll be happy to test your skills in the competitive mode. To be honest, I haven't really played much of this, since I prefer the other modes so much more.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nDon't let its colourful nature confuse you, rocket league is one beautiful & optimized game. I was pleasantly surprised to discover how easy it was to run on even some old potatoes, and its ability to be quite visually appealing on higher settings. The explosions and particle effects are both colourful and beautiful. The cars are nicely detailed, and the animations are right on point. \n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nIf you for some reason haven't listened to Rocket League's soundtrack, get it...now. I find myself upset that it's not on by default while playing, but there are plenty of workarounds to really listen and enjoy the music all year round. The tracks are entertaining and insanely high quality. \n\nSoundtrack aside, the regular SFX are no less impressive. Vehicle sounds, explosions, and the 'fake crowd' cheering are just a few of the many things this game has to offer for your audiophile needs.\n\n[h1]Summary & Conclusion[/h1]\nWhether you've got only 5 minutes to spare, or an entire afternoon, Rocket League offers hours of addictive fun that never seems to grow old. This unique spin on a timeless sport is sure to appeal to a very wide audience, and you can be sure that your experience is likely gonna be a great one.\n\nFor $20, this game is worth full price, but you can always get it on sale pretty often.\nI rarely grant this one but,\n\n10/10 - Just simply fun, addicting and worth every penny.\n\nProps to the devs for showing that an independent team could release such a big hit without submitting to the horrible DLC practices of modern gaming.\n\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\nThis endorsement approved by [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/trureviews]The Reviewers' Union[/url],\nproviding better standards for reviews and reviewers.\n[h1]======================================[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1483491384, "timestamp_updated": 1483491466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 152, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.881083786487579346", "comment_count": 17, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29406468": {"recommendationid": "29406468", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985731224", "num_games_owned": 565, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 85663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1590, "last_played": 1551796536}, "language": "english", "review": "As a competitive gamer, it's not often I'm able to find a game that continues to be enjoyable while I'm getting completely dominated; but Rocket League delivers that perfectly. I've played for almost 400-hours and I have yet to figure out why, exactly, this game is so fun to so many different people from so many walks of life. But whatever the reason, Psyonix has delivered a near-flawless hybrid cross between a Single-Character-Controlled Sports game (Soccer, Hockey, Basketball), a Racing game, a Flying game, and a competitive multiplayer experience.\n\nPros:\n- Replayability is consistent.\n- Servers cover /many/ regions. (Most of the world.)\n- No single Battlecar has a distinct advantage in all fields over every other Battlecar. (There are pros and cons to every Battlecar.)\n- Battlecar customizability feels endless.\n- Fun for casual gamers.\n- Fun for competitive gamers.\n- Quick 5-minute matches so you aren't forced to risk losing after 45-minutes.\n- Split-screen playable Local OR Online.\n- Psyonix listens to players and integrates desired features.\n- This Pros list could go on and on.\n\nCons:\n- Not the easiest game to just pick up and play.\n-- New players may become discouraged by having difficulty hitting the ball at all. (Don't give up! You'll get it down relatively quickly!)\n- Online players can be incredibly rude (as with any online multiplayer game).\n- It takes a LOT of time to become a skilled player.\n- In-game voice chat quality is unbearable. (Most players use third-party VoIP programs to avoid this issue.)\n\nIt has been years since I've found a game that has me as addicted and dedicated as I am to Psyonix's Rocket League. This is a game I'll be playing for a long, long time.\n\n9.5/10\n\n\nEDIT: Paid DLC is not completely cosmetic, as DLC Battlecars have different hitboxes and turn radiuses than base cars.

The car customization itself is an awesome feature that offers so many different customizations.

You find yourself constantly saying 'Just one more game' over and over and over again because you literally cannot just put it down. It's simple: a car arena like showdown on a soccer field with one giant ball and a bunch of boost to fill your rocket powered dreams, but don't be fooled because this game is much deeper than it will originally look. Psyonix takes a very simlpe core idea and allows us to do whatever we want with it because of its purely physics based gameplay. \n\nWhat does this give us though? Let me tell you. Satisfyingly tight controls, action packed multiplayer, awe inspiring aerial goals, sniper tactics, competitive and casual matchmaking, hours of laughing and enjoyment, TONS of explosions (Mr. Torgue aproved), an incredibly balanced game, all future maps will be free, PC to PS4 crossplay, over 150 items for purely cosmetic customizations, and over 10billion of said combinations. \n\nI can really only say so much about the game itself (partly because English was my worst course :P) but what I really cannot stress enough is that you won't be staying for just the game alone. You'll be seeing Psyonix as one of the only developers left that actually understand what we want as well as falling in love with the community. \n\nThe community of Rocket League (and SARPBC for that matter) is probably the most open, friendly and supportive community I have come accross. Of course this is being said before release and I really hope that you new players please uphold our standard of ingame complements, willingness to help out anyone that wants to learn, and general good sportsmanship. If you find yourself running into a few bad apples, don't worry about it, as you climb up the ladder into the ranks with the rest of the long time players you'll notice the warmer atmosphere to say the least :)\n\nNow I suppose I should say that within the last week I've apparently played nearly 90hrs and that's just playing private matches with the same people constantly. Some would think that I'd be bored after that, but you'd be so so wrong. I can play all day, get into bed and watch some Rocket League videos, and then immediately want to play more (I may or may not be addictive :| but don't think you're immune).\n\nAnyways, I'm going to play some more Rocket League.

There is more:\nEven though on the first look this game's concept appears simple and goofy, the depth of gameplay found here is insanely high. Rocket League is one of those games which allow you to do amazing plays and moves if you dedicated time and effort into it, but at the same time provide a lot of fun while played casually with friends.\n\n\n[h1]What to expect[/h1]\n\nThis game is the sequel to the PS3 game Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars from 2008. Therefore the game idea isn't new and the gameplay doesn't differ a lot. But since the same developer Psyonix stay behind Rocket League, their experience allowed them to address problems and improve the game (as well as shorten the name :P).\n\nRocket League provides fast 5 minute rounds inside a box-shaped arena. The edges of the arena are curved to allow players to drive up walls and even on the ceiling. The team size can range from one to four players on each team.\n\nThe gameplay is fast and because of the playingfield's small size goals can be scored from the other side of it, since there are no obstacles in the way other than a potentional defending player. Blocking the ball and doing a counterattack right afterwards happens within seconds and can turn an entire game.\n\n\n[h1]The cars[/h1]\n\nThere are multiple car models to choose from, but their handling or top speed does not differ. Only the hitbox of the cars are slighly different - which creates some tiny variation in the ball interaction. However the main purpose of having multiple cars is to customize it without interfering or imbalancing the gameplay. This works very well and choosing a car is a personal preference rather than a statistical battle to determine which car is the best. The car customization comes with color, surface type, additional decal, wheels, antenna, goofy hats and particles for the rocket trail.\n\n\"Rocket trail?\" you may ask. Well, in Rocket League every car has a Rocket Engine attached to its back allowing to boost itself to greater speed. The best part is that you can jump and shoot yourself into the air with it and being able to fly. This creates gameplay in all three dimensions. Instead of just dribbling the ball on the ground, you can launch yourself into the air and hit the ball before your enemy can. It is not easy and adds a decent learning-curve to the game.\n\n\n[h1]The experience[/h1]\n\nThe game is very polished. The options menu allows key rebinding serparatly for keyboard and controller, very in-depth adjustments to the camera position/behaviour as well as a large choice of grafic options for the Unreal Engine 3.\nTextures are very detailed, particle effects very well made. The grass on the ground is fantastically animated. Even though the arena/stadiums are the same, there are four different theme versions, ranging from a raining indoor park to a full blown stadium with thousand of people cheering.\n\nThe cars handle very well, can turn fast and stick to the ground unless you want and tell them to drift. Once airborne keeping the control of the car or wanting to do what you want is difficult but not impossible. The physic engine of the game does it's work very well. The ball itself is predictable and doesn't behave random at all.\n\nYou unlock new parts for your car customization after completing each game - no matter the outcome of the match. The account progress is ok, but nothing incredible or important. This game shines when it comes to it's gameplay.\n\nThe sound effects as well as grafical effects while playing or just driving around are incredible enjoyable. Boosting to full speed makes you feel powerful, ramming people and even destroying them creates satisfing explosions. And when scoring a goal the ball explodes and creates a shockwave on which you can ride on with your rocket launcher. Directly afterwards you get a replay of the goal in slow motion. At the end of the game you can save a replay of the entire game and watch it whenever you want.\nSetting up goals and blocking the ball also feel rewarding by the system and on a team-spirit basis.\n\nSince the game has high skill ceiling, experienced players can crush any other ones. The matchmaking system works very well in that regard, that you get matched up with equally good players and even indicates if it doesnt find them and slowly extends it's skill range in order to find players as fast as possible. You can group up to play together in normal and ranked games.\nYou also have the choice of selecting multiple regional servers such as Europe, Oceanic, West- and East-America, as well as queueing up for multiple modes (e.g. 1vs1 and 3v3) at the same time. The game will put you in the first fitting game it can find for you.\n\nThe game also provides a singleplayer campaign against the AI, as well as tutorials and training for various parts of the game such as defending the goal and scoring goals. For those who just want to get used to the controls or test can hop into the sandbox mode.\nI also like to mention that you can queue up for an online game from any menu or singleplayer gamemode. So while searching you can play around in sandbox mode.\n\n\n[h1]Downloadable Content (Supersonic Fury DLC Update)[/h1]\n\nAs announced by Psyonix, the first major update hit Rocket League. I first was disappointed that they want to go the DLC route. Not because i dont like to pay for content, but more because of the bad reputation the word 'DLC' has nowadays, fearing that Rocket League gets looked down for doing this markt strategie. But my fear should vanish.\n\nThe first DLC just includes two new car and customization items for a small price. The real update includes free stuff for everyone. New map, new specator mode, better ranked play, improved main menu background, and so on. With the new update the 20\u20ac i pay for the game are even more worth it. And Psyonix plans are to keep going, maybe even into the direction of modding and crazy maps.\n\nSo yes. I am excited for every upcomming Update and DLC.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nI recommend this game to everyone. May it be casual players, those who play in a group to have fun together as well as the ones who like play competitively.
