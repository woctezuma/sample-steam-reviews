Condition Zero\n2. Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes\n\n1. Condition Zero\nBasically Counter Strike 1.6 but with improved graphics and the addition of bots. The bots are amazing considering when this game was released (they're still inferior to human players). In addition, the bots are a great way for beginners to learn about the game in a more relaxed environment. There is also a singleplayer Tour of Duty, which is basically regular counter strike missions against bots, but with additional challenges (example: kill 3 enemies with a sniper rifle). Sadly, the Tour of Duty missions are Counter-Terrorist only. There are no Terrorist missions.\n\n2. Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes\nThis is a singleplayer game. It uses the same weapons and game mechanics as Condition Zero, but with some additions, including the awsome fiber optic camera. Level design is one of Deleted Scenes' greatest strengths. The AI is passable. The story is where it fails, in that each mission is its own self-contained story with practically no connecting elements. I suspect you don't even play as the same person in each mission. Immersion takes a serious hit because of this. It helps to pretend you are playing as the same person.

This is mostly a hidden thing that a lot of people don't know about, so I'm going to tell you exactly what is Counter-Strike: Condition Zero.\n\nIf you buy the game, you get Condition Zero and Condition Zero Deleted Scenes. Both have a singleplayer campaign, but the Deleted Scenes is more of an actual singleplayer story with voice acting and characters that help you, while Condition Zero itself has a singleplayer (there is a multiplayer that I'll talk about later) where you use points to hire more professional bots to complete missions. First, I'm going to tal kabout Deleted Scenes.\n\nCZ Deleted Scenes is as I stated earlier, a singleplayer Counter-Strike campaign mode with story elements that create a plot that you're a soldier and you have to kick ass to get to your objective. There isn't just one story, there's a LOT of them. It kind of reminded me of COD (atleast the older ones, I haven't played any of the newer ones) where you'd play as different characters fighting in different battles, except you don't get switched back and forth, each mission you're a different person fighting different people working with different comrades. You fight in a diverse amount of countries around the globe like Russia, United States, Germany, Japan, etc... All of the weapons from the original Counter-Strike are in CZ but are re-modeled and work differently in Deleted Scenes, like they're more accurate. They also added in a few more peices of equipment like the RC Bomb, which can blow holes through walls in specific areas, a radio, where you can call backup (also in specific zones), a blow torch, where you can blow off locks (once again in specific zones), and finally an optic camera, where (in specific zones, of course) you can basically see through objects. I also love the voice acting in Deleted Scenes, it's not because it's good, it's alright at most, but I just love how bad it can be. None of the characters really sound believable at all, and they really don't get a grasp on what's going on, a lot like the scientists from HL1. But the voice acting may not be good, the writing is actually good. I particularly liked the mission where you'd infiltrate a Russian military base undetected, and while you're doing this you can listen to a few conversations, like how this guy won't trust his buddy with his lighter anymore, or like how it's super cold and how if there was an intruder that they could throw isicles at them. I think if they could've gave them better voice actors, I think that the dialouge would be perfect. Now the gameplay. I'd have to say I absolutely LOVE the gameplay in Deleted Scenes, it's Counter-Strikish but as said before the weapons are a lot more accurate, which makes sense because presmuably you're trained on how to not have a fucking bullet go 60 meters off of where it came out of the barrel. There are different kind of enemy NPCs, some of them are suicide bombers, some of them run up to you with knives and try to stab you,, snipers, assault teams, etc... It's linear, but there are a lot of places in your path to explore and easter eggs and loot. All in all, I give Deleted Scenes's campaign a 8/10.\n\nNow it's time for the actual game. Condition Zero. Condition Zero not only has a multiplayer, but a singleplayer campaign where you get points for completing missions and you can use those points to hire more skilled bots to be on your team, you can choose the difficulty of the bots on the enemy team, but as far as I know, the difficulty you set does not affect the bots on your team. I think it uses every default map in the original Counter-Strike. Also, you only play as CT just like Deleted Scenes. There's not exactly any story, it's just that you have to stop the Ts from defuing the bomb or keeping hostages bla bla bla Counter-Strike things.\n\nNow it's multiplayer. The multiplayer in CZ is actually good. It's like your typical early 2000s game, no bullshit matchmaking, all community servers, and a good mix between comepetitive and casual. It's not like CS:GO where you're paired up with 4 retards just to have an entire enemy team made of hackers. And while hackers are a problem, they actually get banned by admins and people who are way better than you (called smurfs in CS:GO) aren't a problem because you can just leave and find another server with people that meet your skill. I'm not the best at CS but fucking hell I have almost 1,000 hours on CS:GO and Im still in Gold Nova because of how bullshit the hacker thing is. I liked being able to leave the game without having to wait 30 minutes to a fucking month to play the damn game again. CS: CZ really feels like Counter-Strike, not a cash cow with a community more toxic than the air in China where hackers make up 50% if not more of the that toxic community created by a sellout company (because CZ actually wasn't made by Valve, CZ was made by Turtle Rock Studios, and Deleted Scenes was made by Ritual Entertainment). I want to be able to play with real legit players that are at my skill or slightly higher or slightly lower. None of this would be a problem in CS:GO if there was 1. Not a ranking system. 2. No matchmaking and 3. A good fucking anti-cheat. In CZ I don't care that much if I die because it's not going to matter, Im not in a fucking tourtament where I could win thousands of dollars, Im in a fucking normal match in a game.\n\nI give CZ's Singleplayer a 7.5/10\nand multiplayer a 9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1509916485, "timestamp_updated": 1509916485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.751272499561309814", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42033689": {"recommendationid": "42033689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085802751", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 5111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442926813}, "language": "english", "review": "CS:CZ..

Multiplayer Condition Zero & CS 1.6(If you don't have it already) and singleplayer CZ Deleted Scenes. As far as I'm concerned, for multi, it's better to play CS 1.6. Condition Zero doesn't even look that good with \"better\" skins and textures. More people play CS 1.6 so it's easier to find servers too. Also, i think that overall, 1.6 is a better game. Now... it's worth very much to buy this for Deleted Scenes. Everyone who ever thought to themselves how cool it would be if CS had a singlep. campaign... you will wonder no more. You fly around the entire world, there is a mission on almost every continent. It's hard, but good, plenty of meds and ammo lie around so even on the hardest difficulty surviving shouldn't be a problem, rather a challenge sometimes. There are around 18 missions and all of them are good/great. To be honest I expected much less from Deleted Scenes and I was pleasantly surprised. I would recommend it to anyone who still enjoys GoldSrc games. Just remember to switch off that damn vertical synchronisation before you'll start playing. It's on by default, made me move like an elephant with all that input lag ;) \n\nPS: If you decide to play on hard from the start, just remember to play it like regular CS. Don't rush, pick around the corners and obstacles alot and quick, reload only when safe, always aim heads, shoot mainly bursts or single shots, try not to get shot and this will be a walk in the park. Park full of terrorists that is. Also, after you'll finish all of the main missions, there will still remain few undone on the world map, bonus ones, be sure to finish them too, they are  interesting and a little different than the rest.

This game was released in 2004, so almost eleven years ago. Condition Zero uses the Half-Life engine. \n\nWhat we have here is a CS game which includes a single player mission pack. When it comes to playing Counter-Strike, I am more or less a newb at it. This game gave me the perfect opportunity to learn the guns, maps and mission types without the pressure of feeling like you are letting your team down by sucking. The campaign took me about four hours to complete, but this was only on Normal mode, you can go back and replay the missions on a higher difficulty to eventually work your way up to playing online. \n\nI also found the squad management system to be a nice little feature which isn't seen in other CS games, at the start of each mission, you can choose which squad members to take with you on the mission, each of the team members have their positive and negative stats so you can really get stuck in with min-maxing them. You start out with three members and you work you way up to having a full blown squad of about eight men. \n\nOn each of the missions you also have to complete specific challenges, these can be goals set around killing a certain amount of people, winning the match in less than ninety seconds, rescuing a specific amount of hostages etc etc. This added a little variety of play, especially the challenges where you have to use a certain weapon in order to complete them. This allowed you to learn how to use other guns effectively rather than sticking with your tried and tested Rifle and Deagle. \n\nWhile the graphics do not come close to looking like games we have in the current day, the game still does look nice. I wasn't put off by the dated graphics one bit; I guess that just shows how good the Half Life engine actually is!  \n\nThe difficulty levels completely rely on how hard you want to make it. I started out on Normal mode just to get to grips with the game as I am newb like that; but you can work all the way up to playing as if you are in a match online and have the brutally hard experience if you want to. Easy mode is complete walk in the park though, enemies can be standing in front of you for about three seconds before they realize they should shoot you, and even then they spray bullets randomly all around you without actually hitting, so I wouldn't recommend you start out on Easy mode. \n\nLike I said, the campaign took me about four hours to complete, but there are two or three more difficulty levels to try out, and I can see this adding a lot of variety into the game play, so I can easily see the single player alone taking about twelve hours to complete it fully on all difficulties. \n\nI found no technical issues what so ever while playing, I would assume all the bugs and niggles would of been ironed out years ago.. \n\nIn conclusion I can easily recommend Counter-Strike: Condition Zero for anyone looking to get into the FPS or CS scene, it will easily give you a worthwhile experience, giving you the opportunity to learn all of the CS maps, guns and game modes in a pressure free environment. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

In each level, you have to complete a set of tasks, or \"challenges\", while stopping the terrorists from doing their thing enough times to satisfy the level's non-challenge requirements. You can create your own squad by buying teammates from a roster of 36 counter-terrorists, each with different levels of skill and weapon preferences, with points earned by completing levels.\n\nThe Tour of Duty is very simplistic, but it managed to make me like it a bit and I normally hate playing multiplayer-oriented game matches with only bots, which it essentially is. And in my opinion, it on the Easy difficulty feels like a tutorial; One lacking explanations of the game's controls, but also one that trains the player by putting them up against targets that move and shoot back, which is not present in the tutorials featured in the Deleted Scenes and CS:GO. Update: Currently at frustrating point where the Terrorist AI is almost cheating and the Counter-Terrorist AI is braindead.\n\nThen I tried out the multiplayer for a bit. Not long enough for me to actually say anything about it, but from my limited experience it felt like CS:S but different. [strike]I hate CS:S for several reasons so I'm going to see later if it's different in a way that I'll enjoy it.[/strike] It's basically CS:S but deader, has worse level design, and you have to remember to buy ammo. Not my thing.\n\nFinally, the ultimate purpose of this review: The Deleted Scenes. It's a set of 18 different missions, each having a different scenario (and are not connected in a grand scheme or anything like a campaign in say, Call of Duty). I don't have much more to say about it in terms of description, so here's where I begin the \"opinion\" part (I think there's a much better word for it but I'm tired): [b][i]Holy f**k it's good.[/i][/b] It of course suffers from dated graphics and some weaker level design here and there, but it is [i]fun[/i]. I've done all of the missions 3 times over 25~ hours and dear god I think I might do it [i]several more times[/i] even after finding all of the secrets within. It makes me furious that CS:GO's campaigns were limited time because I'd replay a Counter-Strike campaign with CS:GO's gameplay and graphics more times than I think I will replay Deleted Scenes. Update: Forgot to say this when I first published this review but the music's great too. Especially the music in Secret War, that level's awesome in almost every aspect.\n\nOverall: [strike]If for nothing else,[/strike] buy this game just for the Deleted Scenes.

The sound design is greatly improved and the changed guns sound a lot more like an accurate depiction of what a real gun sounds like. Nothing even reminiscent of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds's but closer than any of the stock assets used in the other games. The model, lighting and texture quality was also made better, and both teams not only have a new faction each but also all have new stylized designs that stray farther from the real deal but still gives each of them a character of their own.\n\nNot to mention that the controls are in this void between Source and 1.6 where it has recoil and less absurd penetration but the accuracy and shooting system in general is still 1.6's, which is very fun to play with.\n\nAlong with the usual simple offline bot match, this game has a few sets of 3 maps you have to clear by having at least 3 round wins and exactly 2 more than the terrorists, against a varying amount of opponents with different skillsets. It proves to be a good challenge to anyone and a great way to get good at the game while passing time and having fun. This mode also adds more depth to the CT factions, with each having a tendency to certain characteristics, for instance the Seals and the SAS are braver, while the GSG-9 and GIGN play it safe.\n\n[h1]DELETED SCENES[/h1]\n\nA very memorable experience, worth a replay or two. The large majority of the missions are fun, most of the enemies' deaths are animated with few exceptions, there's a lot of destroyable scenery and the battles are very ecstatic. The weapon, equipment and enemy progression is very well structured but the way the game tells how this worldwide conflict came to be or when is it all going to end is too loose to form anything concrete. My guess? Resonance Cascade. The game lasted 8 hours for me, but you can probably beat it in 6 on an easier difficulty.\n\nThere are a few references to Half Life, albeit probably unintentional, where loot is found inside those small green canisters Black Mesa employees use to store ammunition and weaponry, or in certain places where there are those ceiling turrets you see everywhere around the facility, even if a hell of a lot weaker.\n\nA lot of the maps are very well detailed to the point of it not even looking like a GoldSrc game but rather an early Source engine game. Some of the textures leave a lot of room for improvement while some leave barely any. It uses a lot of flashing lights and other lighting effects so I recommend playing through certain missions like DrugLab or the final skycraper mission in Software mode. Both look better in a some places and in some not, with similarly varying performance, so its mostly up to choice and hardware compatibility. It's an old game, and so there's a chance you'll encounter lag no matter how pricey your rig is.\n\nThe factions consist of most of the OG, the Elite Crew, the Arctic Avengers, the Guerilla Warfare, and a few other ones, such as a few generic Islamic grunts or gangsters. All of them give the impression of Middle Eastern crazies that think nukes = less oppression, though, so the only real difference between them is that some hold hostages and some hold bombs. Basically the same as the multiplayer game, just a lot more exciting and real. The 1337s appear wearing all black with blue jeans, though, unlike their usual green shirt and brown jeans. The heads are all the same for every faction, except all use a different texture. For example, the factions that use the Guerilla Warfare model have different beard types, and the others rarely share the same body.\n\nThere's a lot more cinephys in this game than any other game from the same era. If it hadn't been so overlooked we might've gotten that juicy BF4 levolution a lot sooner than we asked. For example, certain characters that you kill fall out from whatever platform they're standing on and onto crates which break apart in a realistic manner without using any sort of simulation or gib effect. Another example is on the mission \"Building Recon\", when air support flies over a terrorist, blowing him out of the roof he's on and collapsing both his building and the one beside it.\n\nLevel exploration isn't a cryptic must such as in Poke646, where it's harder to find the way out of wherever you're in than to find a hidden cache, or the original HL, where there was barely any encouragement to exploration apart from Office Complex. You're rewarded with OP guns such as the AWP or the M249, which is as useful as it was in 1.6 instead of the crappy crap crap we got in Source and especially GO.\n\nThe player isn't talked much about and isn't voiced by anyone, but he seems to be always shifting, never a single person, as if you were really just a random soldier fighting through the waves of less trained opponents that happened to do a thing that saved a bunch of people, or in some cases just 2 or 3. And yet the game makes you feel proud of what you've done. I admire that. It's a very interesting take on the whole badass soldier vibe that most games nowadays and back then had. You'll probably remember that same mechanic from DICE's latest Battlefield game's campaign, just more pronounced and not ignored.\n\nWhat happened to this game was unfortunate. Very unfortunate. It would've done just as much if not more than what HL did to the gaming industry if it hadn't launched so close to Source and had been properly advertised.\n\nI fully advise you to buy this game if you're looking for a challenge that isn't too hard, but let me warn you, play it on easy. Playing through it on medium had me getting very frustrated in certain parts of the game for simply not being 1% faster than the AI. It's that hard. It's as if the HL1 grunts gained an eye on their back, sneaking is impossible in this game unless if you're told to, and grenades are rather unpredictable. Just make sure to keep in mind that grenades in this game are just like HL1's or 1.6's, even though they can deal a lot of damage if their ray casting doesn't catch their target its not gonna deal any damage at all, even if the target in question is behind a 1 unit thick wall or a on a slightly raised part of the scenery. Best case scenario, its right under their feet.\n\nWasting ammunition isn't an issue in this game. At all. I constantly find myself underwhelmed with ammo until I get something that deals some damage like a Kalashnikov or an M4 or even an AWP or a machine gun. Its like the game really wants you to use everything, but as always the M1014 is ignored due to its shittyness. Oh and don't even bother with the M3 Super 90, they nerfed it so hard its as useful as it is in CS:S and nowhere as cool and neat and super as 1.6's. Everything else is fairly meh.\n\nSome of the mission concepts get tiring after a while; chase the VIP, defuse the nuke, kill the VIP, protect the VIP team, go after the guy that tried to assassinate the VIP, kill him, rescue these people, rescue yourself, repeat. It's repetitive as fuck and some more variation like in the mission Secret War, which I believe is the second one, would've been nice. I had to take 3 breaks before finally completing the game despite my will to do it in one continuous run. The voice acting is ok for the most part but it gets laughable at some others ([spoiler]\"We could always throw icicles at the intruders!

Caught in between CS 1.6 and Source, it came very close to CS: Source's release, and was brushed aside. At the time, it graphics were outdated, and its single player content was lacking. Today, the single player content is just as lackluster. The regular campaign is literally offline bots with some slight customization. It's bland, boring, and the AI is pretty terrible. There's also the \"Deleted Scenes\", which is actually an entirely other game. It's a single player CS Campaign that plays nothing like Counter Strike. It feels more like a fast-paced Arcade shooter. It's plagued with poor map design, cheesey plot that desperately wanted to blend with games like Halo at the time, and gimmicky spy gadgets that while intriguing at first, are poorly executed. \n    Where Condition Zero does shine is its multiplayer. It's graphics are dated but timeless. It feels like an updated CS 1.6 in visuals, and plays in a way thats really unique to Condition Zero. Ammunition is expensive and money is tight, so you really have to watch your shots in this game. It still has a very large playerbase, and holds up much better than the classic 1.6 \n   While Condition Zero failed to capture a single player Counter Strike expirience, it did create a pretty fun Multiplayer that's still fun to hop on today.

[/h1]\n\nMy thoughts regarding Condition Zero are pretty much Identical to the original CS 1.6. This is basically due to both games sharing the same engine, with Condition Zero being different only in the texturing and meshing department. With CS 1.6 showing its age, Condition Zero might be a worth a squirt if your feeling nostalgic. \n\nBasically once the game Is bought you have to two installation options, Counter Strike Condition Zero and Counter Strike Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes.\n\n[b]Counter Strike Condition Zero:[/b]\n\nThis is essentially the CS 1.6 variant of the game which allows for traditional CS 1.6 style online gameplay and a somewhat enjoyable mini campaign which spans across most of the original maps, where objectives are the same as multiplayer however you can build a team for each map with bots of varying skills with more powerful bots costing more resource which you will unlock as you complete the maps. This single player should be avoided since it offers no real value and you are much better off playing on servers with real players.\n\n\n[b]Counter Strike Condition Zero Deleted Scenes:[/b]\n\nThis installation covers the actual single player campaign for Condition Zero. Each theater consists of you playing as a different counter terrorist unit: \n\nGIGN, GSG-9, SEAL Team 6, SAS and Spetsnaz\n\nYou in turn fight againest a variety of different terrorist factions:\n\nArctic Avengers, Elite Crew, Guerilla Warfare, Phoenix Connexion and Midwest Militia.\n\nI rather enjoyed the single player campaign since it deployed a large variety of maps and global locations ranging from fetid jungles to war ravaged cities. Most missions have a pre deployment briefing but these just offer simple intel and not much else. Most missions range from hostage rescue, bomb disarmament to assassinations. In most respects the campaign is somewhat reminiscent to Call of Duty MW which often puts you in the boots of a different soldier serving under a different army.\n\nIn conclusion CS CZ is worth your time if you are a hardcore C.S 1.6 fan like myself. It is pretty much HD 1.6 with a enjoyable single player campaign.\n\nFinal Score: 85/100", "timestamp_created": 1455547363, "timestamp_updated": 1470078667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625395298004150391", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39159032": {"recommendationid": "39159032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118807654", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512750434}, "language": "english", "review": "COD done right by Counter Strike\n\nno, but seriously its CS with some story background\n\nRefreshing after playing with toxic player in CSGO\n\nBUY the bunddle when its on SALE", "timestamp_created": 1515347267, "timestamp_updated": 1515347267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654049396514892578", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22409773": {"recommendationid": "22409773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276171116", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 2110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488317119}, "language": "english", "review": "My Laptop can run it at 100 fps.

Once the round starts the AI are on the hunt to find any enemy player on the field and will not help you so don't expect any help from the AI. Getting a hostage to a drop off, before your team kills the entire enemy team.\n\nThe gameplay is not much different from the original Counter Strike so don't expect a major change.\n\nNow for the feature everyone cares. THE MULTIPLAYER. It's almost completely dead. I had trouble finding a match and when I did get into a full lobby match, I felt bored and it's not as good as the original Counter Strike.\n\nThis game is not good, but it's not horrible either. The campaign is short and not worth the money and the multiplayer is slowly dying out.
