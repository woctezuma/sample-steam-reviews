It's always there, even when you get sick of it, you're still able to come back to it later. I've had lots of enjoyment with TF2 and the community is a huge part of the reason it's so magnificent. Sadly Valve doesn't help the TF2 devs too much, so the updates are VERY slow, but 90% of the time when they DO come, they're wonderful. Overall it's a great game if you love FPS's with a bit of a twist. It's not your average COD game obviously but it does still have the core aspects of an FPS class-based system. The \"DLC\" or essentially battle passes are the only thing that cost money here, but even then you can do very well without, they're more of just an added bonus, as they don't give you any competitive advantage over other players. There are hundreds of cosmetics for your different classes but of course those are optional. TF2 is a great way to get into Steam trading/marketing too!

The game is decently balanced, the gameplay is incredibly fun and addicting, characters like Spy and Pyro are so well designed and creative for an FPS game. I applaud the excellent execution with Spy (how do you balance a character that ca insta-kill?) and the classes are overall just fun and well made. This game is so much fun. However, it is far from perfect. A group of Engineers, with proper coordination, can completely cover a payload or flag, locking anyone from reaching it. I think Engineer is the only truly horrible class and could do with many, MANY balance patches. Though, Engineer isn't the only issue. TF2 is full of odd inbalances like the one mentioned. Scout is so fast that aiming is far harder than it should be, Pyro is horribly overpowered, he serves as a counter to every class in the game, Sniper is really, really hard to use and overall just unfun, etc. That being said though, despite the balance issues, I would recommend this to everyone. It is so much fun and any FPS player would have a fun time with it. Though be warned, this game is very hard. Definitely start with Pyro or Heavy, and those who have no FPS experience should probably start with something like Overwatch instead (its WAAY easier).

Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels.\n\nThere are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'.\n\nPlayer versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objectives for both teams to achieve.\n\n'Mann Verses Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, \"Mann Up\", gives rewards upon completing a \"tour\".\n\nIn addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available.\n\nIn addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them. The trading community is very vibrant and kind, hundreds of thousands of USD are traded regularly between players on sites like backpack.tf or bazaar.tf, so many people with unique outlooks on the world. I've met some of my best friends through TF2 trading and sunk tons of money and even more hours into this game. \n\nThe game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I'd recommend this game to anyone with two hands.", "timestamp_created": 1550784939, "timestamp_updated": 1550784939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49147592": {"recommendationid": "49147592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197483849", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 31615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550530522}, "language": "english", "review": "I mean, come on.

Actually its a free-to-play game so expect some screaming kids... (just mute them). But the reason I stopped was that in recent years, the updates have been lackluster.

The 9 Classes given are unique characters from different regions of US and Europe. Each class has a learning curve to their play style's that range from simple to pick up all the way to difficult to master (Spy being a difficult class to master IMO) and learning the ins and outs of each class is beneficial to your mastery of the class. Unique weapons for each class can be a double-edge sword, giving some stats that improve the classes general stats, such as health, damage and movement speed, whilst also providing debuffs that can hinder said stats, sometimes even to a crippling halt. Though using these weapons are actually fun and can be pretty deadly in the right situations and can even allow you to play a class that you had no intentions of ever playing or to use said item for crafting materials.\n\n TF2 also runs pretty flawlessly too (theres some exceptions to this, such as entering a server or starting up the game, but its understandable dip in framerate and can be easily disregarded), running at a silky smooth 60fps even on the lowest/most dated of PCs. I barely had any real hiccups with this game, then again I can run some other Valve games a 60fps no problem (like Left 4 Dead 2, which still feels like a $60 game to me due to the graphics)\n\n\nMy real gripe with the game is the Toxicity of the playerbase (NOTE: I could have easily put cosmetic crates and the dependency on the market for unique weapons here but those aren't my biggest gripes), dont get me wrong, there are some pretty nice and accepting people online and they tend to be the more forgiving/casual ones often using dances/taunts and having a good time..... it just that there are some people who take it too seriously and will go as far as to demonize anyone who doesnt take the game seriously (child players especially). there are other factors such as mooching for your hard earned weapons/items and/or the empty threats being spewed at you for either not taking the game seriously or dominating with a class you are experinced with. Its one thing to be passionate about a game, its another to threaten to kill someone just because they fragged you multiple times with Soldier or Demoman. I really think this is more of  a \"personal\" gripe more of than a universal one, but I knew to  expect this upon downloading the game.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, TF2 is a game that's super enjoyable to play and is even better with a couple of your friends, the game isn't perfect game but its a game worthy of being in your library, plus its Free to Play so just download for yourself, you wont regret it. :)", "timestamp_created": 1551627009, "timestamp_updated": 1551627009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49349386": {"recommendationid": "49349386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198802639921", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 16176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2064, "last_played": 1551874054}, "language": "english", "review": "its a good game, would recomend.", "timestamp_created": 1551676271, "timestamp_updated": 1551676271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48911553": {"recommendationid": "48911553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088409502", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 162829, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1133, "last_played": 1551644390}, "language": "english", "review": "i perseonally like and play this game.\nbut for a person who put many hours into the game i do not reccomend this for any new players or any people who like playing competetive.\nas much as this game has done good , it started to really die after valve barely supports it with updates.\nwhen the game gets an update, its mostly SKINS and other reskins of weapons.\nlets also not forget how difficult the game is to play.\nfor a player that has just installed the game, will have no chance of competing with other players.\nits not like they instantly throw you in tutorial.\nrather the tutorial is fucking bullshit\nonly 4 classes.\nsoldier\ndemo\nspy\nengineer\n\nwhat about the other 5?\nnothing ... suffer bacause valve doesnt want to add any more tutorials\n\nplayability wise , tf2 is a unplayable one.\nthe stock hud and settings are terrible\nfov is at 70 and viewmodel fov is 54\nand inportant things like autoheal interp and many more are barely changed from stock\n\nlets also not forget hitreg.\nMY GOD does it suck\nits crazy how valve cares about CSGOs hitreg but tf2s being complete shait\nmost of your hits wont register, expecially when playing sniper.\nmeelee is absolute trash, makes sound . no damage.\n\n\npreformance wise this game is wayy to laggy\n3.0 GHZ proccesor is too excesive\nand even then preformance can drop under 60 fps without issues.\nTHE ONLY WAY to have good fps is to tweak the game like hell.\n\n\ncommunity is preety shit.\nlooking at the good side it isint all that bad.\nbecause it has a lot of creative and nice people in it.\nbut what isint good are\ntoxic friendlies\ncancereus bind spammers\nhackers\nmicspammers\ntoxic p2ps complaining about f2ps\n\n\noverall i love this game.\nthe idea is great but in reality the game isint fun after some time.\nand its not like valve updates it constantly\n\nbut if your looking for a good class based team shooter with a lot of wacky stuff.\nthis game is for you", "timestamp_created": 1549832303, "timestamp_updated": 1549832303, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497023582458496094", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48960505": {"recommendationid": "48960505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133106831", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 10196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550025467}, "language": "english", "review": "cant join friends and trying to join casual crashes my game", "timestamp_created": 1550025421, "timestamp_updated": 1550025421, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504098355770111084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48964786": {"recommendationid": "48964786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011180121", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 23961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1551586134}, "language": "english", "review": "Eh. Had the game for almost a decade, with a lot hiatuses here and there. It was loads of fun at first during the early near-vanilla days. And having been through all the major updates over the years, it's both improved and gotten dull. The game flows smoothly, in a technical sense. But these days its a cluster fuck. The game is clustered with countless, bullshit vanity items and \"unusual\" weapons. The ranking system, as with all ranking systems, is broken. Updates are sparse, usually just localization files. Holiday events are just rehashed copies of the previous years, with nothing really new or standing out. Otherwise, the game can be fun and a decent way to pass the time. If you can ignore that, it's genuinely a pretty wacky shooter.\n\nBut the reason I can't recommend this game is the fact that cheaters are commonplace. It seems like Valve doesn't really have as much concern for cheating like they did several years ago. And, most servers are community servers. A lot of servers are poorly set up, allowing any vote-kicked cheater to simply rejoin in an instant as many times as they want. The community seems to be 50/50 on cheating. You wont see them every match, but expect to see them at least once a day if you're a daily player.\n\nAlso, avoid any community following for this game.

It was my first valve game, my first steam game, and also my first real computer game. I played just about every day. I went from not understanding a thing, to thinking pyro was the strongest, and then figuring out that rocket jumping was a thing. I discovered the community servers button and spent  time playing wacky game modes. Jailbreak, ballon races, slenderman, deathrun, and a lot more. I found out about a map called turbine and found a server close by that ran it 24/7. I played on that server almost every day until the day it closed. I met so many people that I talked to all the time and played some tf2 with. Some of them I still call my closest friends today. I listened to numerous sob stories of several veteran players, about how \"it  was better when I first started playing\", yet they were still playing. I would even try out trading  for profit. That would lead me to the unusual I still treasure to this day. I even tried my hand at non-valve competitive. There I found out the true divide between casual and comp players. I decided I would try to take it more seriously. I led a team that only won one game. (The one game that I wasn't in) I played pugs, watched streams, watched matches, practiced my movement, grinded mge, and still sucked.\n\nI remember when valve first added quickplay. I remember the mvm player surge. I rememeber the free to play update. I can remember every single time that people said that made the game worse, yet we kept playing.  I remember the gun mettle update. \"The last good one.\" I remember the tough break update. All the hysteria with balance changes. I remember the meet your match update, and how that \"killed tf2.\" And finally, I remember the jungle inferno update and how it was a step in the right direction but ultimately underwhelming. \n\nBut eventually it got to me. There comes a point where you don't put up with the crap any more. Enough was enough. I was put off by tf2 because of how much it was neglected. The lack of valve's communication, their shameful approach to their comp system, how they view community competitive tf2, and eventually my loss of interest.\n\nTf2 would go on to leave a sour after taste in my mouth. I liked playing it, but every time I finished playing it would spiral me further and further down into a pit of desperation. I wanted so badly for others to love tf2 as much as I did, but not even the company responsible for making this game would. \n\nIt really sucks too. This game is an awesome experience. It deserves more attention. People \n need to get passed the fact its old. Non-valve competitive deserves more popularity and should've really taken off as a major e-sport. The community servers deserve more players so more people can experience the true fun experience you get from meeting others. \n\nTf2 is well passed its prime, its golden age, and its time in valve and the public's spolight. That won't change the way I feel about it. I still hope for a resurgence. Call me crazy, but I don't think this game will every truly die. You can take away quick play, release \"better\" games of the same type to compete with it, cast off this game because of its age, but I will never ever give up my hope.\n\nThis game is so much more deserving of a plain old thumbs up from me. Saying I completely reccommend this game is an understatement. This game is the most incredible multiplayer experience you can have. And it's free!

There's a huge range of playstyle from totally silly to being a competitive tryhard. The skill ceiling is almost infinitely high, you can never stop getting better at this game. I personally main soldier because I find it fun to push myself in improving my rocket jump skills (on jump maps) and 1v1 situations (in mge). Doing a quick run through a jump map, or hitting a wicked nasty airshot always feels awesome. However, if I'm more interesting in goofing around at the moment, I'll hop into casual. \n\nI find it impressive how well this game has been doing since its release more than a decade ago.

I was young and didn't really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and I had a really bad pc, which i still own. TF2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics, but it was one of the more fun games I installed. I met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side. The community back then was more humble compared to nowadays. You have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunny/gross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game. When really, it doesn't even matter if you win or lose.  However, you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way! Although you never know what kinda person you're going to meet on this game. In my honest opinion, if you want to have a game to just waste time on (and money) or just mess around with people you know (which is what I do now), this is perfect. Esspecially the mann vs. machine co-op. I mainly play that now. Although to me, the game lost its touch, update wise, and I moved onto other games. \n\nI believe it's worth a shot to try it out but other than that, I'd keep it as a casual game. I don't think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because it's being flooded by crude people. Atleast from my experiance after over about 4+ years of playing it just got worse and worse. You will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it. You'll be more stressed than actually having fun, I'll tell you that!\n\nAlthough in all seriousness, this game is losing its touch and probably isn't worth making it your main game MAINLY because the updates they've been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be. BUT, it's a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun! All you'll really notice nowdays is...people really love to trade more than actually play. Living off as a free to play would be very tough and you'd need to be patient with items you would want, unless you got that MONEY! Hope this helps.\n\n\nOne last thing, I am not saying this game is bad in any way. I am saying that it's worth trying and playing with friends, or even meeting people! Although there are some downsides that you won't like, such as some stuff I pointed out above. Strictly towards the community. I personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing. Have it as a once in a while game, because it's nothing to be big about, unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there. \n\nJust give it a shot and see what you think!

[/spoiler]\nNow then, I started playing Team Fortress 2 in the year 2012 (In the Pyroland update), a friend of mine recommended it to me and told me that it was free-to-play. I was at first hesitant, it was my first ever real shooter, yeah I was rather new to PC gaming back then. But I downloaded it and just started playing with him. I was awful, of course. As a Gibus wearing, Pyroland exploring, free to play I had really no reason to be good. I then heard about one of my favorite youtubers playing the game and I just joined him. I exactly remember how it went, he was still rather small in comparison to now but I just wanted to talk to one of my idols. He accepted my friend request and we started trading and talking.\nI am now a admin on his Steam group and a staff member of his Discord. Why do I bring this up? To display the kind of connection I have to the game, it made me meet my idol and befirend him and meet so many more likeminded people who loved the game. I then decided in 2013 to finally buy a Key within the MvM update and I was never so satisfied with a purchase in my life. I met many more people, some I'd today consider to be \"assholes\" and some that I still consider some of my best friends ever. This community and the love that many of it's members have for the game still astounds me. It was like a daily routine, always joining a pub server and having fun with a bunch of people.\nFlash forward to 2015 and things don't look as good anymore. I started playing other games and my interest in the game fell. Sure, I'd join into a match or two or open a crate with some rest money I had left from a purchase, but really:\nIt was not the same anymore.\nYou'd get one or two updated every few months that added nothing more but cosmetics and maybe a weapon that sucked.\nAnd in 2016 it happened, the \"Meet your match\" update.\nSuddenly all of the interest I had left was gone. The matchmaking, the changes, the interface, it was all just bad and terribly handled. I went on to play more new stuff and TF2 was nothing more but a memory and I seperated myself from all of my friends that I got to know because of TF2.\nIn late 2016 I got an invite to a discord chat.\nIt was one of my old friends talking to me about a discord server for the Youtuber at the start. I joined and was instantly greeted with love and surprise, by a community I thought that had forgotten me. A bunch knew me, alot had heard of me, alot got to know me. While I was not completely back into the game, I finally felt welcome in a world that I started to believe was only there to kick me in the stomach. I felt good and even if I fell into depression or tough times, a few were there to help me.\nNow back to TF2 (Can't believe I sidetracked so much): A month ago I got a message from a friend telling me about how great the new \"Jungle Inferno\"-Update was. I reinstalled the game after a month of having it deinstalled and...\nI'm in love again.\nTo be fair the matchmaking is still not good, there is no elo system and especially ranked needs a rework. But by god, it feels like the game is in hands again that actually like this game and want it to succeed, I can finally join a pub again in like 5 seconds and have 4 Snipers and Spies on my team, one of them wearing the Gibus and the other 3 standing in one place. I can finally play a class again that makes me feel ultra powerful while I stomp all the enemies or play Pyro and hate myself.\nI can play with my friends again.\nI love TF2.\nAnd I thank TF2.\n", "timestamp_created": 1511313313, "timestamp_updated": 1511313313, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 306, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.906966745853424072", "comment_count": 20, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48323929": {"recommendationid": "48323929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116001453", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 14104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 131, "last_played": 1551282105}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than Fortnite", "timestamp_created": 1547456497, "timestamp_updated": 1547456497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 590, "votes_funny": 246, "weighted_vote_score": "0.90962451696395874", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12458495": {"recommendationid": "12458495", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012675381", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 927957, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 224, "last_played": 1551633354}, "language": "english", "review": "is rly good", "timestamp_created": 1413086906, "timestamp_updated": 1413086906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 102, "votes_funny": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.890848875045776367", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43477211": {"recommendationid": "43477211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250106490", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 133159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 173, "last_played": 1551659389}, "language": "english", "review": "---{Graphics}---\n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Will do\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Awful\n\u2610 Paint.exe\n\n---{Gameplay}--- \n\u2611 Try not to get addicted\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Just dont\n\n---{Audio}--- \n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Earrape\n\n---{Audience}--- \n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Teens (Target audience)\n\u2610 Adults (Target audience)\n\u2611 Everyone\n\n---{PC Requirements}--- \n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Minimum\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Difficulity}--- \n\u2610 Just press a bunch of buttons\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Significant brain usage \n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Not so easy\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}--- \n\u2611 Nothing\n\u2611 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isnt necessary to progress\n\u2610 A bit grindy sometimes\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 Insanity\n\n---{Story}--- \n\u2610 Doesnt have \n\u2610 Something isnt nothing I guess\n\u2610 Not great\n\u2611 Average (Including comics)\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovley\n\u2610 Will make u cry or smile alot\n\n---{Game Time}--- \n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of tea\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 Depends on u\n\u2611 Endless\n\n---{Bugs}--- \n\u2610 Never had any\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Few bugs \n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2611 Ruining the game (Whenever a major update occurs)\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n~~~~Multiplayer~~~~ \n\n---{Salt Level}--- \n\u2611 Replaced with sugar\n\u2610 Barely anything\n\u2610 Balanced\n\u2611 A bit of salt\n\u2611 Salty\n\u2610 Salt overload\n\n---{Servers}--- \n\u2610 No issues\n\u2611 Minor lags every few hours\n\u2611 Can get laggy sometimes\n\u2610 Oh the ping..\n\u2610 Unplayable\n\n---{Status}--- \n\u2611 Top\n\u2610 Always some people around\n\u2610 Not so easy to find people for the party\n\u2610 You ll have to wait for anyone to join\n\u2610 Barely any soul alive\n\u2610 Dead like my insides\n\n---{Matchmaking}--- \n\u2610 Depends on the host\n\u2610 Brilliant\n\u2610 Fair\n\u2611 You might see much more experienced/stronger players\n\u2611 Unbalanced\n\u2610 Completely unfair\n\u2610 Non-existing\n(Inspired by Demonix's War Thunder reveiw.

Team fortress 2 has since then managed to come a long way while still holding the title as best free to play game.\nWhy would i recommend this game to anyone?, Well, I really don't know where to begin.\n\nI've been spending alot of my life playing Team fotress 2, apparently over 4000 hours on it.\nEver since i got the game, i've been making tons of new friends from the casual servers as well as some of them friendly community servers. I tend to group up with my friends alot and have some fun within the casual and community servers.\nThe graphics of the game are simple, yet unique at the same time.\nTeam Fortress 2 has an OST made by a wide arrange of people.\nTeam fortress 2 also has a giant range of mods for people who like to try out a different experience in their games as well as the steam workshop support which allows the great big community of Team fortress 2 to also submit their creativity towards the game, Whether it comes in an Weapon, a hat, a Taunt, unusual effects or even maps as well. It's amazing to see the wonderful ideas that the community comes up with.\nThe Team fortress 2 community have designed multiple maps already with unique gamemodes which might give interests to the player if they'd like to try something out of the ordinary instead of just fighting.\n\nWhen it comes to classes in the game, Valve had made 9 classes which all give the players a different playstyle that suits them as well as an unplayable 10th character known as the civillian.\nYou could be the scout, Fast and quite a big damage dealer for those with a good aim.\nCould be a soldier, knowing how to rocket jump to get to the frontlines quick and fast. (i recommend all new solly mains to learn and practice this as it is really useful)\nThere is the pyro, a class which some hate but it also has some great uses such as keeping the spies away, can carry different weapons as well which can suit a players playstyle, whether they'd like to play Defensive, Offensive or even try to flank an enemy to kill them whilst they're not looking.\nThere is the Demoman, a class that is a great damage dealer and can also do his own explosive jumping using his sticky bombs.\nThere is the heavy, a class which owns up to its name, Moves slower than all the classes but makes up for this with its large amount of health, Can swap out its shotgun for something to heal it too.\nThe engineer, a class who builds buildings to support his team and also great on the defensive side too, placing sentries in key areas so the enemies cannot push through.\nThe medic, a class which isn't that common for people to main, Medic's can heal player to build something called an ubercharge, Once at 100%, This uber can be used many different ways depending on the mediguns, from invincibility to high damage dealing to just rapid healing instead.\nThe sniper, This class is a long range damage dealer, one that is deadly in the hands of a good aim as well as a well-timed headshot can kill any class if they've gone scoped long enough.\nThe spy, (Personally, this is the class i main), The spy is a jack of all trades class, He can go on the offensive, Defensive or Supportive, He is able to instant kill key targets with his butterfly knife with a successful backstab (Also known as a Balisong knife), This could take out medics, Snipers or just the annoying classes, He can use his sapper to sap engineer buildings which will then become disabled until they're either destroyed or the sapper itself is destroyed on the building.\nSpies can also go on the defensive too, being able to backstab any progressing targets, whether its a heavy or pyro or medic, the spy always has you covered.\nDon't want to fight others?, Well we still got you covered.\nTeam fortress 2 also has a gamemode known as Mann Vs Machine, ( a.k.a MvM for short), Which users can team up in groups of 6 (Or 10 on some community groups)\nMvM has 2 versions of it, Mann Up and Boot Camp. Mann Up is for the people who like to pay to play for a chance at winning items whilst Boot Camp is like a practice Variant version, You can test out what Mann up would be like and what it is you'd have to face upon going into mann up.\nMann Up can earn the players unique rewards based upon the tour the player is doing.\n\nReasons i still play TF2 as of today:\n+There is alot of people who test your skills in a fight, Only through fighting better opponents will your skill grow.\n+Valve has managed to launch an VAC Wave, Killed off any aimbotters/Hackers who made the game unfair for others.\n+Being able to play in the wide variety of custom gamemodes people have designed for it.\n+Making new friends which i probably have too many right now x3\n+Always meeting new foes, making new Rivals who i call a great friend too.\n+You can always challenge yourself to do better in certain areas, Like rocket jumping, Trickstabbing as a spy, etc.\n+Valve can almost patch any bug within days of it being found, certain bugs being fixed within an hour or 2 too!\n+There are many communities based around TF2 which are friendly.\nReasons i might uninstall TF2?\n-Can't think of any\n-Very rarely finding a hacker or 2 on Thundermountain, but thats honestly about it.\nBut yes, Thats all i can think about to write within this Review.

It is free, has consistent updates and is solely based on having fun in playing.\n\n10/10 Playability: TF2 is run on the \"source\"-engine, created 14 years ago in 2004. \nAlthough it is slowly becoming a near ancient engine, it is stil reliable, updated and runs well on modern PCs. The game is originally not optimized in any direction, but thanks to its graphic- and mapping-simplicity, it can run smoothly even on bad/old PCs. Lowering the graphic settings has only a small impact for your visual experience, but still can greatly improve your fps. I had played this game with 3 different PCs through my gamer-lifetime and hadn't experienced problems in any way and rarely ever hear of it.\n\n9/10 Gameplay: This game gains most of its value through its gameplay. \nIt has 9 playable classes with certain set statistics like health or running speed. However each class has multiple playstyles through a huge variety of usable weapons, with 3 equipable weapons at maximum. This helps and encourages each player to find their own functional playing style. \nThe playing mechanics are easy to understand and the basic playstyle don't require complicated key-knowledge.\nHowever, the learning curve begins to be very steep at a certain point not far from the basics. It can be fun to learn the possiblities in this game, but is never required to have fun playing against others.\n\nThe game also offers 8 main game modes: Arena, Capture the flag, Control point, King of the Hill, Payload, Mannpower, Special Delivery and PASS-Time. Additionally there is Mann vs. machine were players fight against waves of A.I. Enemies.\nSome gamemodes have sub-modes, like Attack/Defend (Control point), Medieval Attack/Defend (Melee-only Control point) and Payload race (double Payload).\nThe amount of maps for each gamemode is fair and the map designs are generally well balanced.\n\nImportant to note: All weapons are free and repeatedly drop randomly each week and their is absolutely no pay-to-win, pay-to-play or freemium to give any player with money more advantages.\nSuccess and failure is based on experience and skill.\n\n7/10 Community: Despite the games age, the audience is very young.\nThere are some players who get called \"squeakers\" based on their voip-calls, usually because they are young pre-teen boys with a high pitched voice. Additionally it can be a bit frustrating, because certain young players don't enjoy games outside from the competitive view and make their anger sound often. But this is still rarely the case and not generally a downpoint.\nThere is actually an e-sport scene, small, but it is there. I played in it for about a year in a half. It is okay.\n\n8/10 Updates: As said prior there are consistent updates to this game.\nMost updates are small bugfixes, but the game also recieves major updates, giving new maps, cosmetics and even gamemodes. It also adds a lot of community material through a comic-storyline and SFM-videos.

It is a duology of games with the recurring name, Team Fortress, following from the 1996 Team Fortress modification for the game Quake, and its 1999 successor, Team Fortress Classic. A simple, war-themed game, it offers nine various classes, each with their own specialties and sets of skills that enable them to function uniquely in the battlefield, and are thusly categorised into three main divisions; offensive, defensive, and support.\n\nI would recommend this game, as unlike other 'class-based' games that offer a variety of combat classes only, the game instead delivers a large pool of weapons (distinguished as either melee, secondary, or primary weapons), which allows the utilisation of most of the classes in a wild variety of manners distinct from their intended purposes. Such examples involve the demoknight, a variant of the demolitions class which specialises in melee-range combat situations, and rewards said class ranging from increased movement speed, to replenishing charge times for each kill. Another subclass is the ninjaneer, which rather than play the role of a support class (engineer), the class largely focuses on bypassing enemy front lines in order to ambush enemies from behind, cleverly using teleporters to allow other teammates to flank from behind as well. In this way, it allows players to learn and develop new styles of gameplay, as well as improve gamesense in ways which are not available in many other class-based games.\n\nFurthermore, the game provides players access to a wide range of cosmetics used to customise classes as per the player's desires, as well as taunts, which for vanity purposes, interacts with the surrounding environment in some way, whether to dance with another nearby player(s), or to kill other enemies in creative ways, or even signal to said enemies that they are friendly. The possibilities for customisation are vast, and is all possible due to Valve's skilfull co-operation with the Team Fortress 2 community. They take the time to listen to the voices of the community, implementing new features that follow the guidelines of the community's comments and ideas, and more so work swiftly and dilligently to fix the problems associated with the game, to help improve accessibility and gameplay.\n\nOverall, Valve Corporation has done an excelling job at not only bringing additional skillsets for FPS players to learn and develop, but also provide players with a great amount of power at customisation of the characters, and most importantly, co-operation with the community to polish Team Fortress 2 and help draw out its best for everyone to see.", "timestamp_created": 1534940806, "timestamp_updated": 1534940806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 111, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.838477492332458496", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48581338": {"recommendationid": "48581338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174818086", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 126476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4948, "last_played": 1551841779}, "language": "english", "review": "alot better then fortnite", "timestamp_created": 1548567849, "timestamp_updated": 1548567849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 355, "votes_funny": 113, "weighted_vote_score": "0.857923805713653564", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "46731176": {"recommendationid": "46731176", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095259411", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 132863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549191600}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a little conflicted as I write this (what was supposed to be) short review of Team Fortress 2. On one hand it is a really enjoyable game and has possibly one of the nicest communities (yes, there are dickheads, but they seem to be fewer and further between). On the other hand we have a developer that is indifferent to the game at best, ignoring the game and providing half-arsed content drops directly from the Steam Workshop every 6-12 months.\n\nI have spent over 2000 hours playing this game, and over the last couple of years have been trying to maintain some community servers. Unfortunately due to a number of decisions by the developer, Valve, the community servers are dying and they are what made this game so great to begin with.\n\nFirst it was the introduction of Quickplay, which funnelled players onto the Valve servers full of cheaters (who will go way too long without being banned or just start up a new account 30 seconds after the Vac ban). Since there is little recourse for players other than to attempt to kick the offending player everyone is subjected to the whims of the hacking turd. Community servers (with active admins) do not have this issue as they are able to quickly moderate players and ban where required.\n\nThen along comes the Meet your Match update. With it Quickplay (as it existed) was removed. Clicking on any option other than \"Find a Server\" will only send you to a Valve server, which has the same issues listed above. The server browser is third option for how to play the game.\n\nThat was a couple of years ago, and marked one of only 2 content updates from Valve. The next one being the Pyro update, where Valve once again tried to make the Pyro a non-gimick class. \n\nSome people will argue that there have been other updates which I am ignoring. True, there have been other updates, just nothing with any level of content which will draw players back to the game, with the overwhelming majority of content updates being directly from the Steam Workshop. Valve really hit a goldmine with that one. Get the users to create the content for you! This allows Valve to (almost) completely ignore the game.\n\nIn summary I love the game and the community.

Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play. Lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes (each with his own distinct personality) to choose from. The banter between the different classes is entertaining to listen to. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow him to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or higher skill levels. The game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes.\n\nAt the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'.\n\nPlayer versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve.\n\n'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, \"Mann Up\", gives rewards upon completing a \"tour\".\n\nIn addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available.\n\nIn addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them.\n\nThe game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play.

They don't have any hats, they're spraying shit and they're having a blast. They might even be at the wrong point. They might be going backwards to the point that's already been capped. \n\nOn the same team, there's a Scout with a Hale's Own Scattergun. He's got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak, he just got 18. He's going 'I just got 18, sick!' He runs up the stairs, he's trying his ass off. He's get *beeping noises* dodging the 'Oh, the sentry almost got me!' He looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on Gorge and there's two sandwich Heavies having a fucking picnic. So he stops for a second and goes, 'Two... nnnggh!' so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldier's rocket next door...\n\n...The two sandwich Heavies then decide to move their picnic. There's ants. 'There's ants here, honey. I wanna get out of here.' So they get up, they pack their sandwiches, pack up their lunches, and their breakfast, and whatever the fuck they're eating. They get up and walk toward the door to go to RED because they think, 'That spot near the A point for RED is pretty good.' They walk out the door, and they see four Level 3 Sentry Guns pointing at them. They get shot a million times and blow up, and there's like nine Engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions.\n\nThe BLU Scout, at this point, respawns, and walks by the at least 3-4 statues because we all know there's four people AFK when you play this game, you go by the museum of people standing still. He walks out the door and readies his weapon, he's ready, 'I'm going to get another 20 killstreak, just you watch Gaben, I'm going to praise Gaben!' And he goes forward and starts shooting, and he gets backstabbed by a Spy that has been sitting with the Cloak and Dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds.\"[/i]\n\nNormally when I do reviews, I turn into a critic and start to examine that game, pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score. However, Team Fortress 2 (or TF2 for short) helped me make so many memories that if I actually tried to make a fair review on it, it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review.\n\nTeam Fortress 2, is, obviously, an amazing game. The teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult. You need teammates in order to survive and win. The graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game.\n\nI'm not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot.\n\n\n\n[b]I love this game because of its charm.[/b]\n\n\n\nThe game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters, you can't help to love all of them at some point. Scout is cocky and overconfident. Spy, another one of the characters in the game, is technically Scout's father. Soldier is a crazed WWII American patriot. He never actually joined the Army, but instead, he had his own personal Nazi killing spree. His roommate was a magician named Merasmus, who grew to hate Soldier. Pyro is mysterious, but portrays the world as one big happy paradise, known as Pyroland. Demoman is a Scottish alcoholic who, due to Merasmus, lost his eye that is now haunted. Heavy, although he appears to be dim-witted, is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters. Engineer is very intelligent as well, and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with RED and BLU continue. Medic isn't fond of normal forms of medicine, but is still an important member nonetheless. Sniper is from New Zealand, but was raised in Australia. He prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to Superman's. Spy is the master of disguise, and is technically Scout's father, as said before. Of all the characters, he appears to be the most \"mature\" and appears to be the ringleader at many times.\n\nNot only that, but the game has an interesting story. I would not like to get too detailed with it. However, it makes little to no sense but is still funny, engaging, and gives TF2 much more depth. There is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where Mann Co. is being attacked, so the mercenaries have to defend it, called Mann vs. Machine. This game mode ties in with the TF comics, which explain many characters' backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review. The other comics (all of which can be found on TF2's official website) are all funny and charming in their own way as well.\n\nThe community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times, but in the end, it's still an overall great community. I've seen people give out stuff, others mentor some of the newbs (something I do as well) along with much, much more.\n\nYes. the game is considered a \"pay-to-win game\" but it isn't necessarily a pay-to-win game. With lots of patience, you will get what you want from the game, whether it be hats, weapons, or whatever it is you want. The game has a learning curve that isn't too steep, but become dedicated and you'll fall in love with it.\n\n\n\nNo matter how many times you rage to a W+M1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak, or cheer when you unbox an Unusual, or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things, Team Fortress 2 has been a huge part of my PC gaming life and without it, I probably wouldn't be here today. I cannot recommend this game enough, and I hope that many more memories are made on here. \n\nValve may be cash cows, but you can't help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games. Portal, Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike, but this game stands out from the rest to me.\n\nDo I recommend this game?

I started around 2 years ago till today. (12/11/2017). This game has created many memories for me, from watcing spies fly across the map because of a shield bash to soldiers with 1 hp wiping out a whole team (that I was on). I have never been so focused and addicted to a game since the day I started playing. Do I regret wasting over a month of my life? Not at all. I've met amazing people from all different backgrounds. From trolls to kind-hearted people to cancer to pure joy. This game has sent me on a roller coaster ever since I have started playing. I've learned so much about the game, and life in general (I hate cliche stuff, but it's true). If you are that one person reading the negatives looking for even one reason to not play this game (like I do), ignore them. I made the leap to start playing this, and if I never did, I would probably be a big loner on steam. I can't be thankful enough for getting to play this amazing game, which is free, and with free updates. I can't be happier with the people I've met and memories I will forever keep. Thank you Team Fortress 2, and believe me, I'll still be playing till they finally shut down the last server.  Anyways, I better get back doing....Team Fortress 2 now I guess. \n\nIf too lazy, TL:DR\nThis game is the best friend and memory creator I have ever had.

Damn. How to review a 10 years old game? [/i]\n \n[h1] PROS[/h1]\n+[b]The balance.[/b] You can enter in this game and actually play with the stock basic weapons of each class and you'll not be in disadvantage. Every weapon has its ups and downs in the most variety of situations. Its hard to find a multiplayer game with this kind of balance. \n+[b]9 great classes[/b]. Can you think on a 10th class? In my opinion this game managed to get all playing forms into 9 different classes,  each one unique,  each one with its ups and downs,  just like the weapons. Once again,  great balance. \n+[b]Game modes.[/b] You'll have a bunch of different game modes to play.  Capture points, payload, payload race, king of the hill,  capture the flag,  and so many more,  even in community servers..  There's everything. You can even play freakin' hide n' seek. \n+[b]Microtransactions done right. [/B] Everything you can buy in-game doesn't give you any advantage while playing.  You can either get tools, cosmetic items or weapons which,  as said before, will not get the game unfair.  True F2P,  and not P2W. \n+[b]Variety of weapons,  maps and cosmetics.[/b] This game has everything. \n+[b]Competitive and casual gaming included. [/b]\n+[b] Seasonal events.[/b] Halloween, Christmas,  etc,  gets you special gaming period with game modifications. Halloween is great! \n+[b]10 years of updates and counting. [/b] How many games get this support? \n+[b]Humor.[/b] Voice lines are awesome. And taunts. Just awesome. \n+[b]TF2 Economy. [/b] This game has its own economy and it was one of the first games that introduced trading system. Maybe it was the first?\n+ Its F2P!  Try it! \n\n[h1] CONS[/h1] \n- [b]Weapons nerfs and buffs[/b]. Over the years we had changes in the weapons.  Some were need.. Others not so much. And some are still needed to this day. Its not easy,  but the weapons could have a better analysis in this topic,  I think. \n- [b]Bugs after big updates[/b]. My years  of experiencing this game showed me that after a big update comes a roll of problems,  usually resolved after a small period of...  Days? \n- [b] Too many items[/b].

It also breaks a lot of conventions in the genre and has continued to be a proving ground for what a game is truly capable of. For the past five years or so TF2 has consistently evolved through a series of major updates introducing new game-play elements(minor patches for bugs are issued at least bi-weekly), and, occasionally, festive seasonal updates that make TF2 more eventful.\n\nUnlike a lot of FPS out there, Team Fortress provides plenty of things to do other than just \"shot bullet\". TF2 has a really nice replay feature which you can direct, star in, edit, and render in \u00dcber quality(regardless of system specs) your own wartime films that can be posted to YouTube via in-game function. TF2 was also one of the first FPS to have a tradeable item drop system which has produced a very large and viable trading community and market where loot found or crafted in the game is exchanged for other in-game valuables like fancy apparel, rare Items/Weapons, games from the steam store, or even real world $ on the black-market. This micro-economic meta-game is what will essentially help support the game indefinitely, and rewards players for there time spent playing the game, and making it a worthy investment for learning the game. \n\nThe only downside I can note about Team Fortress 2 is that it is currently over 12 gigabytes in size and it will eventually get much larger if it continues on this upgrading trend.
