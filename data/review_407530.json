Do not try to play unless you are sure or slightly sure your computer can run it. There are many people lowering the overall rating of this game because their computer cannot handle it, which isn't quite fair. IN ADDITION, you may find out that you will STOP DISCONNECTING if you change your graphics to lower settings. WATCH OUT FOR: high ?textures?, high sky, and high mesh level detail settings. TURN THOSE DOWN for very quick results. ALSO, making your window smaller by LOWERING RESOLUTION will add fps.\n\n2. Winning a game is not always a result of who has the best shooting skill. This game is survival, you can win many games just by surving, albeit a lot of survivng is being able to take down other players. \n\n3.

The feeling is amazing. Sadly, the fun ends there.\n\nMany moons ago I would have recommended this game. When I first began playing Ark SotF It was the most exhilarating game I have ever experienced. Being thrown into a hunger game esq survival game and being forced to fight against other is a childhood dream. After playing for awhile, I decided to try to compete competitively. I made it to top 30 at one point and was pretty pleased with that. Then, the updates. Now, I'm not going to say that changes to certain strategies were not needed, because some were completely rediculous. But, the developers of this game took to completely obliterating any form of strategy involved in this game aside from getting a hold of the biggest dinosaur possible, leveling it, and bum rushing to the center of the map with it. Changes that have hurt the game include the removal of the ring timer, direction of argent nerfs, and the inability to build on center platform. All of these changes I have made a post on in discussion. If these changes were reverted, my hours on ark would skyrocket. Although, optimization is something that needs to be worked on just as much if not more. I can only imagine how nice this game could have been if they focused on optimizing the system rather than killing the strategic diversity.\n\nEdit: With how much battle royale games have been in the rage recently I really hope wild card steps up and fixes this game, it could be a huge money maker. Honestly I think reverting to free to play, adding some sort of tutorial, and trying to get a little bit of press is all they need to do.

Neither had I, which is what makes this game so very fun!\n\nBut in all seriousness I'll preface this review by saying this is an excellent game that i've thoroughly enjoyed and will continue to enjoy playing, but like any game, it has its pros and cons, and i'll try to point out the aspects of the game here that i've found most enjoyable or sometimes a bit frustrating.\n\nSo what's this game about?\n\nAs you might have guessed, Ark SOTF isn't your typical survival game (no more zombies, don't worry!), with its emphasis on basic to advanced crafting and the ability to tame dinosaurs to fight by your side, Ark SOFT takes a unique spin on competitive gameplay that resembles a fun and rather difficult mix of Hunger Games, Jurassic Park, and maybe some CoD. \n\nSo what are the pros and cons?\n\npros:\n-mostly seamless gameplay:\n      Even though the game is in early access it runs very much like a completed game and I can honestly say I very rarely \nencounter bugs or glitches. It also boasts excellent graphics so long as your computer can run them (mid-grade system requirements).\n\n-balanced strategies:\n       Though riding a T-Rex can be real fun, I personally prefer to make high end weapons, but the point is that either a person with good tames or a person with good weapons can win a match so long as you have enough luck and skill.\n\n-fun mix of opportunity:\n        Though its easy to get into a routine and its oftentimes beneficial, the sheer availability of tactics you can employ (with a little bit of forethought) helps make this game more exciting and prevents monotony despite its single map location. Should I tame a big dino and tank my way through the match, or should I have several fast dinos to kill off players? Should I make guns as fast as I can and hunt people or wait it out and get better supplies? Maybe I should build a sniper tower? Maybe I should set some traps? etc etc. This game has a lot of potential strategy and opportunity waiting to be explored and tried out.\n\nCons:\n\n-Large learning curve:\nYep, sorry guys, if you're new you will die over and over and over again. Its a very fun game and sometimes it can be fun learning the hoops, but this game at its core is largely unforgiving and doesn't care if its your first or fiftieth match. Whether you get one-shotted two minutes into the game while sorting through your inventory, or you think you can swim to the other side of the river with cloth armor, you'll probably learn most aspects of the game the hard way. \n\n-Only one map:\nThough it is a large map and there are lots of places to explore and things to do on it, it would be nice to have a bit more variety in terms of the map location(perhaps a different biome from Survival Evolved?) \n\n-irritating ranking system:\nThough when you're a low level the ranking system seems to work fine, because it is based off of enemy player scores and what place you get, the game can be pretty dumb and oftentimes seem unfair in the way it rewarded or deducted your score. For example, if I win a game of FFA I will on average go up about 4-6 points, but if I get one-shotted 30 seconds in by a high ranking player I go down about 20 points. This isn't a big deal if you don't care much for leaderboards or pro-tier gameplay, but it can be very frustrating if you do.\n\nAll in all though guys, this is a great game and its even free to play, if you're even remotely considering trying this game out I deffinitely recommend it and invite you to try it out for yourself. Just try to learn quick and maybe watch some youtube videos on how the game works to save yourself from some learning curve frustrations.\n\nAnyway hope this review is helpful to you guys and that your T-Rex is the next one to fall to my entourage of grenades ! \n\nSee ya in the arena guys, and may the odds be ever in your favor . . . unless I'm in your match ;)", "timestamp_created": 1469746770, "timestamp_updated": 1469746770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.734434604644775391", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38343730": {"recommendationid": "38343730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127935907", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 46689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508719856}, "language": "english", "review": "778 hours.

It resembles the Hunger Games trilogy, you start falling from the sky into platforms, and from there your only goal is to survive. \n\nMany people didn't get the \"survive\" part of it, since it is one of the most quick-paced and hardcore games there is of its kind. The learning curve is extremely steep, with no tutorials nor guides to follow from the developers themselves. Most players quit and the amount of people that played lowered exponentially, since it wasn't fun for unexperienced players with no learning material.\n\nAnother reason why players quitted was the lack of new resources, and the amount of care the developers gave to the game, which was close to nothing. Sure, there were some tournaments in place, but these were won by the same people most of the time, since it is a hard to learn game. \n\nToday, the lobbies for a match to take place take a long time to start, because of the lack of players. The game is outdated, and tournaments no longer take place. Many people take advantage of the new players and kill them for the additional points which affect their ranks. This game is in the edge of complete extinction or in its way to the renovation of the game, bringing more and more players. This all depends on what the developers decide to do. \n\nI would recommend playing it, since it is very fun and addictive if you get the hang of it.

They released a patch to fix the FPS problems, so you should be able to run it more smoothly now!\n\nWITH LINKS TO HELP WITH YOUR FPS! IT WORKED FOR ME. ALSO SOME TIPS FOR NEW PLAYERS ON THE BOTTOM.\n\nFirst, I want to start off by saying that I never commented on any games before. But I am a big fan of SOTF ever since it was just a mod in ARK survival evolved. After seeing all the bad reviews, I feel like I have to type something to help this game grow bigger. \n\nI do agree with most comments about the bad FPS issues. I do noticed a big drop in FPS in SOTF comparing to ARK survival evolved. But ever since I download a game booster and did some minor tweaks following the links I am going to post on the bottom, I did see a big increase in my FPS. So hopefully it will help you guys as well.\n\nAlso, if you have never played ARK before and wanted to try out the game, I do agree that this game is pretty brutal for new players because you are going to die A LOT. But again, who didnt die A LOT when they first started out with ARK? U die from hunger, thrist, cold, heat, other players, or dinos. This is just part of the game. And personally, I like a game that is challenging. I think that having this do give other players who are not good with PVPing a better chance to win against people who are great with crossbows and guns. While you are dying off to all the events and dinos, the good players are ALSO facing the same events and have a chance to die as well. \n\nSecond, I do agree that unranked lobbies take too long to start sometimes. It will be great if they add a voting system in the lobby, if more than 50% vote to start, let's just start the game. It's much better than forcing a certain amount of tribe numbers before starting. \n\nOverall, I love SOTF. I don't have the best FPS in this game, but the game mode and the graphic is awesome. I love the fact u can try to tame dinos to win the game, or u can simply go tech and craft guns (if you are good at pvp and have awesome frames). Unlike other royale battle i've played, I have yet get bored on this game mode because there's so many different ways to can go to try to win a game instead of doing the same thing EVERYTIME. Trust me, u will get better if u don't give up. \n\nSIMPLE TIPS for new players: \n\n1) Don't run into the center. If you have good frames, go ahead and run in. But the center really dont have any items worth enough for you to get killed within the first 5 mins. (Basically, u want to run down, find a safe spot in the wood, and rush for spears, bows and arrows, before going out in the open)\n2) Pick can get you - Thatch from trees, Flints from rocks, Meats from dinos. Hachet can get you - Wood from trees, Stone from rocks, Hides from dinos. You get fiber and berries by picking bushes. And u get chitins by killing bugs/scorpions and chopping them with hachet after they died.\n3) If u happen to be by a red drop without other players, loot it. It gives you really good stuffs.\n4) DO NOT stay on the beach for too long. You will be found very easily and get kill.\n5) Cloth armor can help with heat and hide armor can help with cold. U might need 2-3 standing torches with megacold too\n6) Nacroberries(BLACK) can keep your unconscious dinos from waking up. Just put it in their inventory and force feed them if u think they will wake up before taming is done.\n7) Stimberries can help you recover your stamina (It's great if u are running from dinos or other players). Keep them in your hotbar. But they will drain your water level (the yellow, blue, and purple berries will increase your water level)\n8) Try not to start a fire if u dont have to. It tells people where you are. DO NOT use torches at night unless you are freezing. (The little ice cube icons appears when you are freezing, and your health will start going down at that point)\n9) Don't chop down the whole tree or rocks, when trees fall and rock explode. It gives out your direction\n10) If you run into big shiny golden metal nodes, stay by it, gather, kill and tame dinos. Once u get to level 20, u can make forges to burn metal to ingots. Make smithy and make some good gears and weapons. (Metal picks give you more metals too)\n11) When you are looking at your inventory to craft or simply to check things. ALWAYS lie down on the floor before doing so, it's harder to see you that way. (Of course, if you are lying down on the beach, people are still going to see you)\n12) If your bones are broken (U will see a broken bones icon appears), the only way to recover your health is to laydown. Walking around will kill you. So find a safe spot and lay down if you are not being chase)\n\nHopefully these tips can give you guys some head start and prevent u guys from dying too much. I'm gonna post the two links i've used to help with my FPS on the bottom.

This game has a small learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it's a very fun game!\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n-[u]You can tame dinosaurs.[/u] [b][i]Dinosaurs.[/i][/b] These dinosaurs help you carry more items, and attack enemies for you. These dinosaurs typically deal more damage and have higher health than you, so it's definitely recommended to tame more than one.\n-[u]Nice graphics and atmosphere.[/u] The graphics in this game are very nice to look at and are very detailed. Sometimes, in the midst of the chaos, it's nice just to take in the scenery around you. The world was very beautifully designed.\n-[u]Hilarious character customization.[/u] This game takes character creation to a whole new level. Not only can you choose the basic stuff: hair color, eye color, size of your character, gender, etc., but you can also over-exaggerate these features like crazy! If you wanted to, you could make a character that is 4 feet tall with very muscular arms and very skinny chicken legs, and so much more!\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n-[u]Requires a powerful graphics card.[/u] This game is kind of poorly optimised. If you want this game to run smooth (or over 30 FPS), you must use a good graphics card.\n-[u]The learning curve.[/u] If you've played ARK: Survival Evolved, this most likely won't be a problem for you. But, if you were like me and just started off with this game, it is certainly a challenge when you're first learning how to play this game. Learning how to tame dinosaurs, how to get good loot, and how to use some weapons can be a challenge. Just be prepared to face players with more skill than you, and be patient. You will learn how to win, it's not too hard!\n-[u]Evolution Events tend to be a little broken.[/u] Evolution Events are random events that occur that are specifically designed to endanger the player (with the exception of a few events: Double Taming, Food of the Gods, Harvest Bounty, Herbivore Drop, Supply Overload, Super Loot Crate). Some Evolution Events, such as Mega Heat, are kind of broken. For example, with Mega Heat, the player must remove all of their clothes to help cool off. This wouldn't be such a problem if the Event didn't maintain that heat. You could even swim in the river and constantly drink but still lose health due to the heat. Of course, these aren't big issues, just be careful when the events occur!\n\n[b][i]TL;DR...[/i][/b] This game is very fun. It has awesome graphics, as well as an amazing atmosphere. It gives you the ability to tame dinosaurs and create silly characters. Although, you will not be able to run this game smoothly unless you have a good graphics card. The learning curve is a challenge to get used to, but isn't too big of an issue. The Evolution Events are designed to kill you, and are very good at doing their job.\n\n[b]I [i]HIGHLY[/i] recommend you play with friends; free-for-all is very hard if you're not very good at the game, and random players aren't always good teammates.[/b]\n\nAfter playing this game, I rate it [b]8.5/10[/b].

This game! It's the best fucking game ever!\n\nbut let's get the cons over with: \n\n1) The game is rather dead, but we can always hope, it makes a glorious return.\n2) A game takes forever! A game takes atleast 35 minnutes, unless you die early-game, which isn't really better.\n3) The ranking system is completely fucked... If you're a player who just joined the game, and therefor is rank 1500, you will most likely meet people of 1900+ in your first match, and it dosn't get any easier, cuz people of high rank can just join a low rank match like it was nothing.\n4) The first 50 hours, will probably not be incredably fun, since you have to understand the mechanics, and learn to outsmart other players(which feels awesome, if you do it right btw.). I do recommend you play ARK: Survival Evolved, before even touching this game.\n5) You will be killed in a 100 different ways, before you understand, to watch your back.\n6) Once you die, you're out. This is the best thing about SOTF(Survival of the Fittest), and the worst, since this is annoying when you get killed, but it gives a freaking rush when you kill someone.\n\nFinally! the Pros:\n\n1) The rush you get from eliminating/killing another player is amazing!\n2) The game itself might be rather dead, but the community is still very much alive. If you try unofficial, you'll find tons of cool people, with a lot of wierd settings/gamemodes.\n3) Once you die, you're out. This is the best thing about SOTF(Survival of the Fittest), and the worst, since this is annoying when you get killed, but it gives a freaking rush when you kill someone.(This is the same, as number 6 of the cons.)\n4) You have so many possibilities! You can either go for guns, like longneck rifle(classic sniper) simple pistol and simple shotgun, or you could gather some berries/meat and some tranquilizer arrows and go tame creatures like rex, spino, bronto, argentavis, sabertooths, raptors and more! you can also mix crafting with taming and make a combo like an argentavis, a sword and a shield, and then just jump your enemies from the air! or make some c4, and put on a little dodo, and send it to it's death with a huge explosion!\n\nI don't know what else to say, but let me know, what you think about the game in the comments! :D", "timestamp_created": 1492165991, "timestamp_updated": 1499468284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.61524730920791626", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "47421385": {"recommendationid": "47421385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088379231", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1544404160}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than fortnite", "timestamp_created": 1544375617, "timestamp_updated": 1544375617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.693048059940338135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30923216": {"recommendationid": "30923216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203433163", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 197670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 79, "last_played": 1551807369}, "language": "english", "review": "I had so many good moments on this game.

A free-for-all needs 25 players for a ranked match, and even when 25 players were in the lobby, many times, the game failed to start.  I would have played more, had the lobbies functioned a little better.  I also suspect that some people are abusing the finickyness of the lobby system to disrupt normal gameplay.\n\nOnce you get in a game, you are placed in a giant bubble in the sky, where you can talk smack, plan your plans, or otherwise occupy your time.  It is important that you make your character, make your tribe, and possibly your flag, as soon as you can.  Press L to form a tribe, by the way, for those who don't know.  I am hoping that the devs can get this whole rigamarole straight, as it's probably driving people away from the game.  Perhaps an out-of-game way to craft your character, flag, and set up a 'quick tribe' to use once you get in a match?\n\nAfter a period of time, you are descended to the playfield via a beam, where you are free to run amok.  In my first match, I mostly played stealth and lasted quite a while, until I encountered a man taming a trike.  I felt good during the fight, like I was winning, but the trike woke up and he whistled it onto me, and I died, caught between a trike and a hard place.\n\nSecond match, I stealthed to an area with several good specimens of beast, and tamed myself an ape.  With that ape, I then went ape, killing 3 other players.  The fourth player was able to mount his anky and overcome my element of surprise, and his trike and stego ended up finishing me off.  I was close, though.  \n\nThat is all pretty good.\n\nI recommend this game with the expectation that it will improve over time.  Ark was nearly unplayable when it came out, due to FPS issues, and now, even on my modest old computer that most would be embarrassed to own, I can play it at 40 FPS.   Ark: SOTF does run a bit poorer than that, but with a little tweaking, it ran well enough for me to score numerous kills and make numerous direct hits with bows, spears, and slingshots.  \n\nSome people will be surprised at the suddenness with which one can die, but I enjoy that aspect, as even a guy on a rex can be killed by bugs when he stops to drink or loot a fallen enemy.  \n\nI haven't tried the tech path of play yet, but it suspect it's risky until the end, when it all pays off.  4-5 combatants I've faced were hidden, attempting to make guns and armor to counteract dinosaur mount power.  At least 2 of them made it farther than me.\n\nWhich brings to another point:  When you die, you are immediately ejected from the game into the menu.  I appreciate why spectating is a bad idea, but at least having a scoreboard to see who won a match would be nice.  \n\nIn the lobbies, you can see your own simplified stats, but I can't figure out a way to vew other people's stats.   Related to the above point, it would be nice to know who you were up against, as well.  Maybe something to note how often a person has killed using their mount, vs melee weapons, vs ranged weapons, etc.  I would like to know if a player in a match is an axe murderer or if they want to skulk in the shrubs waiting to bushwack the 2nd to last tired competitor with a shotgun to the face.\n\nIn a nutshell:\n\nThis is a game that is still in development.  It has some problems that may be game breaking for some.  It is based off of Ark:  Survival Evolved, and has most of the elements of that game, including crafting and heavy inventory management, so it has a learning curve.  It demands a lot of your system, and may not play at framerates that some are used to.  It is frustrating not being able to get into a game from the lobby.\n\nThat being said, it has a lot of potential, was fun for the 2 matches I've played, and it has freaking dinosaur shotgun giant ape cannibal with a spear fights.", "timestamp_created": 1458598527, "timestamp_updated": 1458598527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 94, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.8076896071434021", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29192805": {"recommendationid": "29192805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095364610", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484951707}, "language": "english", "review": "- Game starts\n- Grab what I can then run away\n- Get wood\n- Make a bow\n- See a mammoth\n- Attempt to tame it\n- Success\n- Tamed 2 more dinosaurs\n- Feels prepared for anything\n- Starts making a house\n- Randon carnivore drop\n- world spawns a Spino on me, killing me instantly\n\n20/10 realistic and would hate everything again\n", "timestamp_created": 1484175561, "timestamp_updated": 1484175561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 61, "weighted_vote_score": "0.731363654136657715", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24215974": {"recommendationid": "24215974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135505591", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 10104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1533782799}, "language": "english", "review": "great game.\n\ni played this without playing survival evolved and hated it but something kept me going back and after maybe 15 hours i loved it now i cant stop playing it.\n\ni play games like league of legends and HATE that you can do good and still lose due to your team.\nthis game is great for the fact you dont need your team to do well its you and only you\n\nnothing better than tamming a big dino and eating everyone :)\n\ni got this free but i bought ark se after now you can only play this after buying ark se.", "timestamp_created": 1468096336, "timestamp_updated": 1505356492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669524133205413818", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32047805": {"recommendationid": "32047805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025072571", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500494078}, "language": "english", "review": "PROS:\n- A really good Battle Royale\n- Superb Graphics\n- Easy Matchmaking system (mechanically speaking)\n- Dinos\n- Engram simplification as compared to ARK: SE\n\nCONS:\n- Kid community at times you'll hate the human race\n- Unfair matchmaking - there's only a min. points system, no max limit\n- Quite behind in updates as compared to ARK:SE\n\n\nAll in all I will recommend this game but ONLY if you like ARK: SE and fancy checking out a Battle Royale gamemode.\nIf you're getting ARK just for this - don't.

There is enough options to personalize these features to your own likings.\n\n\n[h1]The verdict[/h1]\nIt is a very intriguing representation of survival versus player spiced up with jurassic creatures kind of game, however if you ever feel like to settle down and play in a more laid-back [b]p[/b]layer-[b]v[/b]ersus-[b]e[/b]nvironment manner, ARK: Survival Evolved would be an appropriate game for you.\nIt holds great potential to continue as a game that is cared for by the developers but then again, [i]don't quote me on that[/i].", "timestamp_created": 1458107807, "timestamp_updated": 1458108445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 187, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.71349787712097168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "42128514": {"recommendationid": "42128514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278678159", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477756448}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was so good its a true shame it got killed seemingly overnight if it was more active id definitely recommend but ill just do that anyway i had fun", "timestamp_created": 1526765870, "timestamp_updated": 1526765870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552004992961883545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36022905": {"recommendationid": "36022905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163185535", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500761545}, "language": "english", "review": "At the time it came out, this game was great, but not so much any more.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a fun addition to the core game, but if Studio Wildcard want more people to play this (during the release period, they've said that this was just an experiment with Ark, so I don't think they do), then they'll need to work on it.\n\nThe game is a modified version of the game in its earlier stage, which means that a lot of the items, dinos, and stat changes are missing.
