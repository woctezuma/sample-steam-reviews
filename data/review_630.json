Surprisingly, there are still a couple of people playing online at any given time, so it is still possible to find someone to play with, even if Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop makes the original title somewhat obsolete with new campaigns, more settings, and fixes for many outstanding issues.

Alien Swarm was developed by Valve and released mid 2010. Many of the initial players were lured to the game by the lure of an Alien hat you can unlock via an achievement on Alien Swarm.\n\n\n[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]\n[b]Story:[/b] You are a member of a team of space troopers who are investigating the circumstances of a seemingly abandoned/evacuated space colony, and trying to recover whatever data is still available.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511844225\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] Alien Swarm is played from a top-down shooter angle from a 60 degree camera angle, you move your cursor to aim, and can simultaneously walk any direction using the keyboard keys.\nSome people have dedicated servers for Alien swarm, however most people will simply host a game from their computer, your latency will depend on the hosts internet settings and physical location.\nAs you succeed or fail missions you will gain experience, this experience is put towards your level, when you level you unlock new weapons, armor, and tools. There are 25 potential weapons that can be chosen from, including special weapons like sentry guns.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511844179\n\n[b]Achievements:[/b] There are 66 achievements on Alien Swarm, after your first level you will get a good grasp of the different achievement difficulties, at the time that I'm writing this review, I've earned 53 achievements, most of which were earned either grinding by myself [i](by using a console command, it's possible to play solo online)[/i], or joining small groups online or playing with a friend occasionally.\nThere are two types of tough achievements: Beat the game on the hardest difficulties, and speed run achievements, both of these require a fairly coordinated group of players to work together and know what they're doing.\n\n[b]Price:[/b] The best part about Alien Swarm is that it's completely free! This is probably because the project was scrapped after the first campaign. It's nice that this game is free, but I would have preferred to pay for the game if it had a single player mode and more campaigns.\nThe good news is Alien Swarm was released with an \u201cAlien Swarm software development kit\u201d which is also free, so the Steam Community could create their own campaigns! Second best thing to the original dev's picking up the project again.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511844204\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] Story: forgettable, but this game is more about the experience then the story narrative. Gameplay: addicting, fun, best to play with friends. Achievements: Many are soloable, you're better off with a group of pug players the easiest difficulty is your best bet if you want to learn the game. Not an easy 100% completed game. Price: Completely free to play.\nI love this game, even if it's free to play.  I've enjoyed playing this game in between playing other games more vigorously.

Sporting a top-down camera with an adjusted 60 degree view and set in a sci-fi realm, Alien Swarm arms you and up to three additional friends for some seriously fast-paced shooting and survival combat.\n\nFor those unaware of the history of Alien Swarm, it was created from a mod from Unreal Tournament 2004 by a team that was hired and supported by Valve. Originally, the game was produced by Valve, but unlike some of the more popular titles such as Counter-Strike, Team Fortress or the Half-Life series, it never really got the focus and recognition that the others did. In fact, there is only one official campaign in the entire game, called \u201cJacob\u2019s Rest\u201d, which is comprised by only a handful of levels. However, that does not necessarily detract from the overall appeal of the game. \n\nAn obvious downside to playing Alien Swam, as mentioned, is the one solo campaign. Within the confines of this one mission, your task is to land on a colonized planet, investigate what happened, exterminate all hostile alien lifeforms and rescue any survivors. \n\nYou\u2019re given a choice between four classes: \u201cOfficer\u201d \u2013 your primary gunner who earns passive damage and resistance bonuses as well as unique weaponry unique to only them, the \u201cMedic\u201d who heals teammates, the \u201cTech\u201d who can deploy sentries, hack systems, weld doors with incredible speed and can carry class-specific grenades and auto rifles, and lastly, the \u201cSpecial Weapons\u201d which boasts massive damage output. Within these classes are 40 different equipment pieces that you can select based on your class, play style and need, making customization fairly simple and streamlined.\n\nThe game, as mentioned above, as a major drawback: that one campaign. However, the game included the software development kit [SDK], which, for those not familiar with the term, is the source code to it, allowing for full-scale modding and customization. This spawned a vibrant modding community that has made some truly fantastic campaigns to play, keeping Alien Swarm alive and well with new content and challenges. With the SDK included, users can play any of the user-created content, create their own or modify ones to their liking or specifications.\n\nWith all that said and as with other Valve products, Alien Swarm has a smooth multiplayer interface, full overlay support and integrated invitation options to invite your friends. While playing solo is fun in its own right, the game really shines when playing with a group of four, invoking the need for communication, teamwork and support of everyone involved; make no mistake, Alien Swarm can be extremely punishing.\n\nA variety of difficulties, friendly fire penalties, tight corridors and waves of aliens means Alien Swarm will test both your reflexes, intuition and ability to work together as a team. Don\u2019t get cocky, because when you die the game will freeze and slow motion capture your painful, premature death and let you know who killed you. So if you\u2019re use to blaming your \u201cfriendly\u201d fire on glitches, your friend or the enemies, the game will most certainly be there to call out your transgressions for all to see.\n\nWith consistent statistical data being tracked outside the game [much like other Valve titles], Alien Swarm provides an in-depth look at what classes you excel at, what weapons you prefer, your accuracy and how many times you sabotaged the mission with excessive friendly fire and much more. It becomes a handy tool when deciding who you want to complete some of the more excruciatingly difficult achievements the game has to offer. \n\nAlien Swarm is one of those games I feel should really be re-examined because what is here, is wonderful. Smooth level design, crisp features, class customization, full source code and level design and a great atmosphere make it a great game to play for newcomers and veterans alike. There\u2019s a severe amount of untapped potential within Alien Swarm. Did I mention, it is free?\n\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1] \n\n[list]\n[*] It\u2019s free so there\u2019s no risk involved. Try it!\n[*] Solid multiplayer and co-op support\n[*]Responsive firing mechanics\n[*] Class variances make each class important in their own way\n[*] SDK support for complete editing and modding support. Make your own campaigns!\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1] \n\n[list] \n[*] The original campaign is the only one that was introduced with the game, making the starting content lacking and the downloading of mods necessary to fully enjoy this title and increase its replayability. \n[/list]\n\nOverall, Alien Swarm is often overlooked by other Valve titles. While the consensus among fans is that it is a worthy title to sit down and play, many people might not be familiar with it or know how it came to be. As more and more titles are being released every day, Alien Swarm still stands as something worth playing, even after all these years.

The core of the game is planning your route through the campaign and mowing down hordes and hordes of aliens as you and your friends are barely hanging on to life. Sweet.\n\nSome things in Alien Swarm that I would love to see in other games of this genre:\n- Shared map where you can all plan your route. \n\n- Minimal loot, minimal stats, focus is on loadouts and interesting effects (freezing, burning, electricity etc.). Going through loot is tedious when all you are doing is increasing DPS.\n\n- That climatic end. Believe me, if you don't spoil yourself by playing on a lower difficulty, the finale is worth the wait.\n\n- The tactical nature of the game. The game gives you a lot of tools and weapons. Bar the door, and the alien has to spend time smashing through it. Lay a wall of fire and watch the hordes melt before your eyes. But all the defenses are temporary, and the aliens can and will overpower/overrun them. You and your friends have to plan properly to use your limited resources for victory. Some of my favorite moments in this game is defending a point while hordes and hordes of aliens stream in from everywhere. All the defenses and traps we laid are exhausted but we do manage to pull through.\n\nOn top of that, with friendly fire on, you really have to plan things out so you don't end up shooting each other. You even lose ammo if you reload early! That's a feature that's missing on a lot of games. \n\nThere are some cool things in this game borrowed from third person shooters, like crouching (for cover) and calculating line of sight so you don't hit obstacles/the floor/the wall. Definitely makes the game feel more \"grounded\" and adds to the tactical layer, although I honestly don't remember if I ever used crouch.\n\nGet some friends, play on brutal (yes, from the beginning), and have fun.", "timestamp_created": 1482472824, "timestamp_updated": 1482608594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676726698875427246", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22885050": {"recommendationid": "22885050", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982295752", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 969, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474655335}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting top-down shooter that is free to play for all Steam users, uses the Source Engine 2010.

Let discuss some of the features the game offers.\n \n \n[list]\n[*][b][u]Graphics[/u]-[/b] Seeing as Alien Swarm came out in 2010 I think the graphics have aged really well and the game still looks good in todays world. The game looked realistic enough, it is what you would expect as a Source Engine game.\n \n\n[*][b][u]Gameplay[/u]-[/b] I did go into this expecting it to be a little on the clunky side, but I was very wrong. The game flows very well with the perfect mix of intense action and calmer parts.I felt as if the a few of the default controls were pretty poor, as in the equipment, often times a grenade or mine was binded to \"1\". I quickly rebinded that. As you would expect from a Source game every key can be changed. The game has a good level up system that allows you to unlock new weapons and equipment for every level. Health and ammo is balanced very well, and by balanced I mean there is not very much of it, so play it safe and only shoot when you must.\n \n\n[*][b][u]Combat[/u]-[/b] The combat in Alien Swarm really caught me off guard, it was quite good and very lively. With the vast amounts of weapons, equipment, and classes the combat can stay fresh for longer than the game itself. There is a good amount of different types of enemys that are almost all completely different and even must be fought a with different tactics. My only gripe here is that near the end of the game the way the set-up the mass amount of big enemys it makes it so the best plan is to try and just dodge them enough to sneak right past them without using ammo.\n\n\n[*][b][u]AI[/u]-[/b] For the most part Alien Swarm is leans more towards a horde type of game so enemy AI doesn't really exist the just rush you. Although the game does offer a \"Offline Practice\" I did not use that feature so I cannot comment on the friendly team AI.\n \n\n[*][b][u]Story[/u]-[/b] This is where Alien Swarm really falls short in my book. I'm sure I missed a little bit of the \"story\" throughout the game because I was on mic with the person I was playing with but nonetheless there is not much of a narrative here. It just seemed like it was do the 3 or so objectives on the mission then escape. I love a good story and this just did not capture me at all.\n\n\n[*][b][u]Replayability[/u]-[/b] So the game is fairly short with only seven missions in the campaign. Although there is a good number of different difficulties; Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane, and Brutal. Me and my buddy played through the game on hard, it truly offered the perfect amount of challenge for us. The thing is, for anything above that you would really need more than two people, and from what I understand there is not a whole lot of people playing. There is a really good amount of achievements to get throughout the game ranging from really easy to get to needing to put a stupid amount of game time in to get. I'm going to sum it up now to stop my self from rambling on, I played through the game once then uninstalled. To me the game had a lot more life to it than that but the person I played with no longer wanted to play it. \n\n \n[*][b][u]Value for Dollar[/u]-[/b] This doesn't really apply to a Free-to-Play game, but that means you don't have an excuse not play it.\n\n\n[*][b][u]What Would I do Different or add?[/u]-[/b] Alien Swarm was a really well made game. In my mind in just lacked narrative and amount of missions. If it had that it would have been even better than it currently is.\n\n\nIf you have any questions or comments concerning the game or my review do not hesitate to ask!", "timestamp_created": 1499150839, "timestamp_updated": 1499150839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.653112053871154785", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "41903411": {"recommendationid": "41903411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028791188", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1527203736}, "language": "english", "review": "Old but gold.", "timestamp_created": 1525691405, "timestamp_updated": 1525691405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620253145694732666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36088474": {"recommendationid": "36088474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017636421", "num_games_owned": 672, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 1834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504212239}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely good top-down shooter free game with up to 4 player co-op (or bots, but they suck).

A game that had potential, but comes out just feeling unfinished. The concept is good enough, but it probably got canceled and someone just decided that it would be shame to leave it, and put up what they had at that time. And well, if it wasn't good enough, people didn't like it enough for it to become good thanks to the community.\n\nThe only thing that truly keeps this game alive, if you can even call it alive, is the fact it's fully Free to Play. No payment on Steam, no microtransactions, nothing. You can join the fray at any time and see what they got in store for you. However, it still features a level system - the more and the better you play, the bigger level you are and the better equipment you get.\n\nThis unlocks one of the games biggest advantages - a very smart equipment system. You can choose between four classes, with two characters for each, both with completely different playstyles. Then you get to choose your equipment, two weapons and a utility. Of course, all four of the classes have access to equipment available only to them, as well as access to certain shared equipment. For example, the Medic is the only one capable of carrying the Medikit or the Medigun, the Commander is the only one capable of carrying shotgun, the Engineer is the only one capable of carrying a rifle with autoaim etc. The game then features more than 40 weapons and about 15 utilities (if i recall correctly). This allows you to play the game differently every time, but thanks to the level system, certain weapons will always be better than others, even though the game does try to balance them out.\n\nThe gameplay is then based around a co-op mode for four players. You (and hopefully a team you can trust) are sent to a colony gone dark to investigate, and *drum roll* fight off aliens there *badumm tshhhhh*. However, you are alone. So you need to conserve ammunition, use medkits and cooperate while holding off the bugs in order to survive, and fulfil objectives along the way. All in a top-down Source game. That means the SDK makes the maps quite interesting, counting in things like fire, liquids or destructible enviroment, even some in-game animation parts along the way. This all creates a feeling of being swarmed and overrun, yet deeply dedicated to ending the mission succesfully and without casualities. Talking about casualities, it's worth noting that there's friendly fire ON by default. Watch it.\n\nProbably the most notable change is the Source SDK here. If a big community would be on... millions of maps. IT's just that easy to make them. Tile based creation and Source modelling = Map. I tried it out myself, it took me exactly 76 minutes to recreate the first level. It's just sad it is not used.\n\nAlso please note that Win 8 is not supported by this game. It will run after you install it, but Win 8 will screw up it's files and you'll have to reinstall sooner or later.\n\nAs to my recommendation, I can say that this is a game you will enjoy at first, and then become disappointed by later.
