Story, Depth, Replay Value, and Structure. Fallout New Vegas does not randomize enemy encounters and loot. if you intend to build a character a certain way, the necessary equipment will always be behind the same locked door or security terminal, some people overlook the importance of this as Fallout New Vegas encourages you to approach the post apocalyptic wasteland in different ways. Fallout 4 relies on random loot drops to change the experience of each playthrough. FNV has very few short comings but it would be unfair to avoid disclosing them. Obsidian entertainment was forced to rush out FNV with a minimal period of development and production which resulted in certain faction quest lines being incredibly underwhelming and transparently partial. The \"evil\" Legion has lots of promise as you can instead choose to ignore the fundamental New California Republic and help establish a tyrannical dictatorship of the mojave desert, that is until you learn that pursuing the legion questline ends the game significantly sooner than almost any other route with less content being explored. Outside of the shortcomings in content for certain paths in the game, Fallout New Vegas manages to make a finite world seemingly infinite. I have replayed through the same quests and locations of the game countless times and still today I am finding new bits of lore and connections that make the game radiate with charm and narrative. Fallout New Vegas is without a doubt the best first person fallout rpg in that it is strikingly like a classic fallout rpg. Sometimes you forget you are playing a first person shooter because the focal aspect of roleplaying, and that is the greatest achievement of this game.

He probably rolled his eyes, but I was a pretty Good Kid and an even better smooth talker when there were video games at stake.\n\nI am so incredibly thankful that the gunplay in this game fucking sucked. I'm thankful that I struggled to properly navigate or appreciate the wasteland during my first few days in it, only to then slowly unwrap one of the only games that met and exceeded all of the unreasonable and impossible expectations a young adult lets into their head when they look at a game's cover art. I enjoy recalling the simple melodrama my old self thought they were tearing through as they sided with the NCR and f***** up every form of opposition that fell upon them. I enjoy coming back to the game now to laugh at my old self as well as to remind myself why it will always be important to get into fights at parties about how Fallout 4 in absolutely no way is part of the \"good old days\" of this \"franchise.\"\n\nCan you even call it a franchise when Todd Howard gets to make games with titles that share a word with \"Fallout: New Vegas?\"\n\nAnyhow, I used to think that this game forever changed the way I would look at games because it was my entry into a deep, dark, and delectable world of Mature gaming.

I\u2019m glad I believed them.\nThis is a true masterpiece, one of the few cases in which the majority of the people is right, this game is far superior to Fallout 4 in some aspects, though it\u2019s still inferior in some others.\nIf I had to choose between this and Fallout 4, I wouldn\u2019t know, since both are excellent games and each has as many advantages as disadvantages.\nIf Fallout 4 for example, they decided to simplify (or even remove) some systems like the decisions, the dialogue options, the multiple endings, etc. But it still added some very important features such as the new crafting/upgrading system for weapons, armor and power armors; the settlement building, the survival mode, and some things like the resource management, the exploration and the shooting mechanics have been massively improved.\n\nHowever, about New Vegas...\n\n[b]The good: [/b]\n\n\u2714 Decisions that truly matter and affect the world (unlike Fallout 4)\n\u2714 Dialogue options, incredibly superior to Fallout 4\u2019s.\n\u2714 Extremely fun campaign and superior to Fallout 4\u2019s (though it\u2019s a bit shorter)\n\u2714 Interesting characters and factions, each with great variety of missions and stories.\n\u2714 Huge amount of secondary missions and places to explore.\n\u2714 I found almost no bugs or performance issues.\n\u2714 S.P.E.C.I.A.L.\u201d system, levels, experience and skills are better than Fallout 4\u2019s.\n\u2714 Excellent DLCs (Lonesome Road and Dead Money)\n\u2714 Epic endings that explain what happen to each faction or character after the story ends (unlike Fallout 4, in which no matter what ending you choose, the ending cinematic is the same)\n\n[b]The bad: [/b]\n\n\u2716 The gameplay is undoubtedly inferior to Fallout 4 (the weapons, for example, behave and fire way worse compared to Fallout 4 or any modern shooter)\n\u2716 The map is worse and more boring than Fallout 4\u2019s map.\n\u2716 You can\u2019t run/sprint. Though there\u2019s a mod for it.\n\u2716 The weapon/armor repair system is terrible, I\u2019m glad they removed it for Fallout 4.\n\u2716 Same as Fallout 4, some things need a better explanation or tutorial since they\u2019re not clear for people who didn\u2019t play any Fallout game before.\n\u2716 One disastrous DLC (Old World Blues)\n\u2716 The Mojave conflict ([spoiler] Hoover dam[/spoiler]) is way worse than Fallout 4\u2019s Commonwealth conflict ([spoiler] The Institute and their Synths[/spoiler]), I just found it less interesting.\n\n[b]Notes: [/b]\n\n\u2022 After I played this great game, I edited my Fallout 4 review, though I still recommend it.\n\n[b] Fallout: New Vegas is, for me, the best game of the year 2010, and obviously recommend it at any price, with some DLCs.[/b]\n\n[b]Related reviews: [/b]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/arezlon/recommended/72730/]\u2022 Fallout: New Vegas - Dead Money [/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/arezlon/recommended/72740/]\u2022 Fallout: New Vegas - Honest Hearts [/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/arezlon/recommended/72750/]\u2022 Fallout: New Vegas - Old World Blues [/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/arezlon/recommended/72760/]\u2022 Fallout: New Vegas - Lonesome Road [/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/arezlon/recommended/377160/]\u2022 Fallout 4 [/url]", "timestamp_created": 1551133139, "timestamp_updated": 1551134323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626640558242797852", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49067837": {"recommendationid": "49067837", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172273461", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1538205670}, "language": "english", "review": "All I can say if it doesn't have 76 in the title, then this game is good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll seriousness though this game is probably one of my favorite games I've ever played.

Story\n2. Atmosphere\n3. Choice of Weapons and Playstyle (with Dlcs)\n4. Lot of Factions and Npcs to interact with\n5. Big world to explore with around 100 hours of playtime (with Dlcs)\n6. A lot of references to older titles\n7. Good range of companions\n8. Easy fast travel option\n9. Music and soundeffects\n10. Most of the Dlcs (except Honest Hearts)\n11. Great modding community\n\nNeutral: \n\n1. Graphics are outdated (you really want to use some mods for that)\n2. Some bugs (there also mods for them)\n\nCons:\n\n1. Gameworld lacks some Depth at times\n\nIn-Depth Review:\n\nThere is nothing fancy about the story. No big plot twists, or anything you have never seen befor. It's the possibilities and different angles you can tackle the story from, which makes the game great.\nThe Atmosphere is just stunning, either if you walk around all alone, or with a companion. The ambient music just add to it wherever you are. There also a few radio stadions you can tune into, with the \"Old World Blues\" Dlc adds the very best of them. \n\nCrawling around in caves, exploring buildings, introduce yourself to a new faction, or just hang out in the Wasteland. \nThe ingame world is more then big enough to explore for a few hours of your life. The second you explore a new location, you can fast travel there. Which you have to do a lot sometimes, when you are questing . \nWhich brings me to the only real con of the game. There so many places which feel a little off and i never really found a real purpose for. And the main habitats could be more connected, or rather be connected at all. \n\nNonetheless, when it comes to roleplay, that's the Fallout game you wanna play. The sheer number of choices, when it comes to your personal playstyle, it's just insane. There pistols, rifles, shotguns, heavy weapons, even more heavier weapons, energy weapons, unarmed and all kind of melee weapons. You can stealth, smartass, or bribe your way through the game, but you still have to fight at times. Unfortunately there is no way around that. \n\nGraphics are very outdated, especially the textures and the faces of the npcs. But there comes help with a great modding community. It took me a few hours to get me a perfect setting of new textures (items, weapons, faces, flora and fauna), added gameplay elements (Project Nevada, more Traits and Perks and such) and even an ENB (if your computer can handle all that stuff). But it's absolutely worth it.\n\nLast point is the Dlcs and that's where the game really shines. Every Dlc brings a standalone area, where you can travel to , when you have discovered the entrance. \n\"Old World Blues\" tops them all, for me a least. It brings humor, a good story, insane side characters, references to the old games and that awesome radio stadion music. Very well done.\n\"Dead Money\" have great depth, a very unique situation to handle, interesting companions and story to offer.\n\"Lonesome Road\" brings and interesting aspect from the couriers past into play and you will find yourself in an unique situation as well, but it just dont have the depth of the previous two.\nWhile \"Honest Hearts\" nearly fails in everything above. No depth, uninteresting story and unispired companions and side characters. That i didnt liked it, dosent mean you dont like it ofc.

First, gameplay is still challenging at high levels.  Second, the writing quality is good; the Fallout contrast of daffy 50's tropes with the wrecked postwar world remains sharp, and provides many of the funnier one-liners I've encountered while gaming.  Third, character specialization is a real thing; if you have the dlc's you will likely max out all your skills, but perk selection and characteristics (strength etc, aka \"S.P.E.C.I.A.L) will have long term consequences on combat style and will allow or foreclose on some play options.\n\nOn the minus side even by Bethesda standards this game is an unstable bugfest.  Running Windows 10 on a strong PC it took six mods to get ordinary gameplay operating correctly (or at all).  Also, the vanilla UI is cluttered and requires endless scrolling to find specific items.  Too, the vanilla graphics are low res and rather bland; this would not ordinarily matter much to me but you often need to find small objects and it is frequently quite hard to see either because of light levels or because of clutter. \n\nAs a final note (as it does not reflect on the game's own merits) this game is somewhat difficult to mod due to frequent incompatibilities between mods, requiring more than usual care about both installation and load orders and many compatibility patches.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1550516580, "timestamp_updated": 1550516580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49360107": {"recommendationid": "49360107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040563917", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 6534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546488705}, "language": "english", "review": "The best Fallout.

1551838063}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly a great RPG- I think it goes a bit too far to call it the literal best, but its pretty far up there, and arguably the best 3D RPG (albeit I'm not too familiar with 3D RPG's, so take that with a grain of salt.) You truly get to ROLEPLAY, with a variety of choices and many different endings you can achieve. You really give your character a role, with not too much of it being staticly set to you (the Lonesome Road dlc adds quite a bit more for the courier, which would be worth mentioning, however.) I find myself playing this very frequently, and it made me enough of a fan to buy Fallout 3 (which I bought in GOG for compatibility reasons) and the 3 originals. It can be at times very slow paced, and there are definitely some poor elements to to the game that would be prudent to mention. I can state some pro's and con's off the top of my head, so I will do so:\n\nPros-\n-True roleplaying capability that I touched on a bit in my opening statement. I think a large part of my gameplay has been for roleplaying's sake, as I've already seen almost every single ending (through gameplay or otherwise) and most quests. The thing is, though, you get immersed into your character and it makes each string of quests and choice seem very interconnected and important, even if some of the time it is an illusion. This not only makes the game very replayable, but it also makes it feel like a journey each time.\n-There's a pretty cool combat system. Although the combat overall is quite bad, I would argue, the actual system including DT and VATS is pretty cool and fun to use, even if you want to argue its just a gimmick, it's a long lasting one (although after 465 hours I still find it fun, so I don't think \"gimmick\" really gives it justice).\n-There's a console you can dick around in. For me, being able to dick around and test the game is very important, and that's something you can do. If this is something you also find fun, you'll find the console to be a joy; you can do a lot more than you can in most games, and its pretty easy with the thorough (fan made) wiki's this game has online. The console overall is hardly problematic.\n-Can actually teach you a lot. Talking to one particular legionary, I've actually been opened up to a lot of philosophical thoughts I'd never thought of. What's more, I've learned a lot of history, stemming from this game and leading out to really cool world events I'd not known about prior.\n-Depending on the type of person you are, may open you up to some moral quandaries. At times these quandaries are pretty dry, and depending on how you play videogames, may not really open to you as much as the prospect of blowing shit up will. However, various groups and quests leave you wondering whether or not you're thought process is okay, or who and what is most needed.\n-Very moddable. Although you may not feel the need to, the option to dabble into the mods that players have made is quite nice, and I've enjoyed a large portion of it.\n\nCons-\n-The game is very glitchy and not very compatible with modern systems. Buying the GOG version of this game instead of this one helps to fix this, but if you buy it on steam, mods are a necessity to fix it. And I do mean a necessity; the game will crash too frequently and your experience will be ruined. So be prepared to get mods, or switch to GOG for this one.\n-Shooter combat is inconsistent and pretty poorly made. I don't really know how to adapt too much on this, but when you play it, you can really tell. It feels not smooth and a lot of damage values and options don't really make sense. And combat is glitched at times, especially with explosives.\n-Outdated. You are looking at an old game. Unless you get some mods, the game will play and feel like its release date, which may be hard for you to acclimate to.\n-Slow. This may be a deal breaker for you. For some, like me, its not that big of a deal, but I've had friends who have bought and refunded the game simply because they felt really slow. This mostly means the actual way you move, but at times story progression and pace can be too slow for ones liking. \n\nSo, take from that what you will. Unless the cons seem to blaring for you to enjoy the game, I would highly recommend buying it. I've played it a lot, and I'm not even close to done. This will in time (if it isn't already) be remembered as a gem of a classic that is played for a very long time.", "timestamp_created": 1550865507, "timestamp_updated": 1550865507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49168766": {"recommendationid": "49168766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207017357", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550522240}, "language": "english", "review": "Hell hath no fury like an angry mailman...

FNV was the first western RPG I had ever experienced when I got it on the Xbox 360 in early 2011, and since then I've played nearly 1,500 hours of it across 12 playthroughs of ~120 hours each. It is my favorite game of all time, but not necessarily because of nostalgia. Fallout: New Vegas has, to my mind, never been surpassed in its pairing of roleplaying [i]and[/i] narrative flexibility, by any game since its release - and I've played The Witcher 3, so you know this game must have something special. Therefore, that's what this review [i]must[/i] prove.\n\nWhen you start a new game, most of everything you [i]need[/i] to know about the plot of New Vegas is laid out for you in one of Fallout's many iconic slideshows, but if you are entirely new to the franchise, I'd suggest clicking [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvqm_pPD-aQ]here.[/url] Otherwise, I'll just state that New Vegas is much more connected to the stories of Fallout's 1 & 2 than 3 or 4, due to it being set on the West Coast, and is in some ways a continuation of the story from Fallout 2. The rest, I'd rather not spoil. Although, in this specific Fallout... You are a courier, hired by the Mojave Express, to deliver a package to the New Vegas Strip. What seemed like a simple delivery job has taken a turn... for the worse.\n\nDue to the fact that the only stipulation placed on the backstory of your character is that you were at one point in time a courier, the character you create can essentially be [i]anyone you want them to be.[/i] If you have the ability to coherently write a character, FNV becomes your own narrative playground; one of my favorite elements of the game. The character creation tools presented at the start of the game are suitably expansive as well; between skills, tags, and traits. Further progression in New Vegas is also superb, as you raise your skills accordingly and select from many game-altering, or at least useful, perks. Obviously, the character creation and progression in FNV is exemplary.\n\nIn FNV there is a plethora of dialogue, choices, consequences, and other roleplaying mechanics to be found. These systems all work together in perfect harmony, which puts real weight behind your actions. This could even mean small actions, such as stealing from some friendly wasteland townspeople who you know would suffer for it, as you are reminded of this by a reduction in karma. The dialogue system is especially of note though, as this is where most decisions are made, and where you express the personality of your character. There are always a stunning amount of choices you can make, and you'll never feel like a viable option was left out - in any situation. Many of your decisions even leave lasting effects on the Mojave, which I'll explain in greater detail later on.\n\nNew Vegas is well known for its intricately constructed faction system and politics, as you can choose from one of four main factions to end the game with, as well as affect nearly two dozen other minor factions - either by aiding or hindering them. Each organization has their own backstory and lore, and all of them have quest lines worth delving into. These groups will remember how you treat them, which builds a lasting relationship between them and the player. It's these dynamic factions that really bring the world to life through their thematic depth, and give the Mojave a lived-in feel.\n\nNow that you have a sense of this game's successes, I'd like to highlight why it's my favorite game. Because of how incredibly detailed and lore-dense the Fallout series is, the jaw-dropping amount of narrative flexibility in New Vegas is what seals the deal for me. The ability to shape the Mojave as I see fit, a world that is so well realized, is unbelievably tantalizing to me; and I don't think any RPG has handled this better. It makes me feel like such a tour de force, that it's my character making these monumental decisions, and changing the future of a whole region - forever.\n\nFNV takes place in the Mojave Wasteland, clearly, and the desolate design of this setting establishes a highly authentic apocalyptic atmosphere. I find the vanilla graphics to be timeless because of this, but mods can certainly modernize them. The region is a joy to explore too, as there are countless locations with pieces of environmental storytelling, quests, and loot within them. There's also an optional hardcore mode, which makes these barren wastes just that much harder to survive.\n\nAs a side note, I'll quickly state that almost every side-quest in New Vegas is spectacular. They were crafted with the utmost attention to detail, as they all have several ways to progress through them; and sincerely thoughtful writing applied to them. Each storyline has a distinct and often original motif, which makes them all a pleasure to play and experience.\n\nAnother important part of the game are the companions and characters, who all share one thing in common; purpose. Every follower has their own quests, backstories, and motivating factors that make them relatable to the player, and from even the most minor of (named) characters to the most important, everyone has identifiable personality traits. No one feels like wasted potential. These honest personas are what grounds your adventures in FNV, by making you truly care about the Mojave and its inhabitants.\n\nChanging tone, Fallout: New Vegas' combat is fun, but also clunky. Shooting, stabbing, bludgeoning, disintegrating, and exploding your adversaries is what you'll spend most of your time doing when not exploring the wastes or having a pleasant chat, and this level of variety is where the strength of the combat lies. Just because it's clunky, doesn't mean there isn't visceral joy to be had. The V.A.T.S. system has also returned, but I don't personally use it. In essence the combat is just good enough to impress, but modding, which I'll mention later, can improve in considerably.\n\nThe biggest downfall of New Vegas is, undeniably, its performance. This is almost entirely the engine's fault; Bethesda have never been known for their technical aptitude in games creation - and Obsidian had to make do. Minor bugs run rampant, as well as crashes if you don't make necessary tweaks to the .ini files, which you can look up to discover what I'm talking about. The game also stutters often, but mods can alleviate this issue for the most part. My advice would be to save often, and install a few mods, which is the next topic.\n\nOne of the greatest parts about Fallout: New Vegas, and the post-Fallout 3 series in general, is its customizability. Anything from simple fixes to new quests, and visual overhauls to gameplay tweaks can be added to the game, and to do this I'd recommend the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/?]FNV Nexus.[/url] I'd suggest watching some tutorials on how to mod the game, and from there NVSE, NVSR, NVAC, and Project Nevada are all essential mods as far as I'm concerned, but it's up to you. Visual mods are also welcome, however they're subjective so I won't recommend any here. All considered; [i]modding[/i]: a useful skill for any FNV player.\n\nI hope I've made my case as to why this is my favorite game clear. It's not the best at everything it does, but what it does do correctly is simply exactly what I want from a game. The roleplaying, decision making, characters, world, lore, narrative - and so much more, just binds together into such a cohesive package of everything I ask for from an open world RPG, that I can't resist it's call. And, if I remember correctly (but of course I do, I could never forget), it sounds a little like this...\n\n[i]I got spurs that [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DD_NCM_RJs]Jingle Jangle, Jingle![/url][/i]\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: \u221e/10 - My Favorite Game[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1497082035, "timestamp_updated": 1545511512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2024, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.973539471626281738", "comment_count": 74, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42152569": {"recommendationid": "42152569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126189013", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1532049359}, "language": "english", "review": "\"They asked me how well I understood theoretical physics.

The combat in Fallout: NV is very fun, just because there are so many ways to destroy your enemies in the game along with V.A.T.S makes it very fun to see kills in slow motion. \n    Leveling up in this game is also fun, there are tons of perks and different skills that determine which perks are available. This makes the game have lots of replayability.\n\n     There are tons of diverse locations for you to explore in the Mojave, although alot of the land between them feels empty and weak.  The game will even reward you for exploring these side areas, from a certain vault's equipment room to much more, it feels natural.\n\n    The game will also introduce a reputation system, basically the karma system but for each individual faction in the game, the factions which are also fantastic and even an old friend will come to see you from FO1.\n  \n     This along with lots of side activities in Vegas such as gambling, such as Blackjack and Roulette which can be very rewarding with high luck stat. Alot more side quests are available once you get to New Vegas as well!\n\n[h1] STORY [/h1]\n     While the story in this game may feel a bit cliche at first, it definately gets more interesting later on, as the characters you meet in the story are memorable. That with the multiple endings and choices you have in the story, add to the games replay value alot!  \n\n[h1] AUDIO & MUSIC [/h1]\n     The sound design for the weapons and creatures are very well done, as with the music and the radio are also fun to listen, many scores from Fallout's soundtrack can be heard in NV, such as \"Metallic Monks\" giving a great sense of nostalgia to any classic fallout player!\n\n[h1] GRAPHICS [/h1]\n     Fallout: New Vegas uses the same graphics engine as Fallout 3, which may seem a bit dated now, but it still can give lots of beautiful shots with the landscape of the Mojave Desert. The game and graphics run very well on new and older PCs alike. You should have no problem running this game!\n\n[h1] OVERALL [/h1]\n     All together Fallout: New Vegas recieves a [h1]9/10[/h1] from me, it's a great game with very high replay value, along with a decent story.

Virtually unlimeted posibilities when making a character. (Not as much as TES: Skyrim, but really close).\n[*]Mod Support:\nThe modding community is very expansive for a game that has been out sinse Oct, 23 2010. If you can think of something, it probably exist!\n[*]Open World:\nDepending on what version you buy (Standard or Ultamite edition), you will have plenty to do. Sights to see, things to shoot! \n[*]Weaponry: \nFallout: New Vegas is full of many types of weapons. Everything from M4 carbines to helicopter propeller swords! But don't forget that there are mods for anything you desire.\n[*]Hardcore Mode:\nWant something more realistic to a real life apocolypse? Well Fallout: New Vegas has a \"Hardcore\" mode you!\n[*]Multiple Playthroughs:\nThere's not just one way to experience New Vegas, but four ways!\n\n[u]What I disliked:[/u]\n[*]Crashing:\nFallout: New Vegas will crash on you at least once or twice. Whenever it does it can be anouying having to go back and redo quest that you've completed.\n[*]Navmesh:\nDespite the occasional crash, the navmesh in this game works, but is a little sloppy. Sometimes NPCs will walk into walls and furniture. But it is easliy overlooked when you get further into the game. (You may even find it funny)\n[*]PC abilities:\nThis game is not the most demanding game for a PC, but can effect your overall experience of it. (I.E. glitching, FPS drops, and crashes)\n\n[b]So what's the difference between the standard edition and the ultimate edition?[/b]\n     The ultimate edition is the standard game, but with all of the DLC will it. Yes it cost an extra $10.00 but is worth it compared to buying the standard edition for $9.99 and all the DLC for $22.94.  \n\n[i]All-in-all:[/i]\nFallout: New Vegas is a good solid game for the money. You'll find yourelf captivated by it's charm and want to play evenmore of it. It does get a little dull after a while, but does have a fantastic modding community. I would purchase the Ultimate Edition instead of the Standard, just my opinion.

Where Fallout 3 was set in D.C. this game is set the Mojave desert around the ruins of old Las Vegas. The theme throughout this game is a western one, but many different factions are present, each with their own unique (and often hilarious) style. And of course there is a power stuggle between a pre-war industrialist, Caesers legion and the New California Republic is under way and you are about to be thrown into the middle of it. What will you do?\n\nThis game is filled with great characters, hilarious dialogue and so many entertaining quests that it would be hard to do them all in a single play through. The DLC adds many more hours of fun although it is quite varied in flavour and in value, but all of them are worth playing at least once. The exception might be Lonesome Road, which most people loved but I had some issues with, especially with one decision it forces you to take that I felt was not one any of my characters would ever have made. But Old World Blues may be my favourite DLC for any game ever. The first fifteen minutes had me crying with laughter. \n\nWhen you add the fact that the modding communty is adding more of everything, this game could provide several hundred hours of play time and still have things to offer.

Its one of the best open world games available and I can't recommend it more, full price or not. This is truely one of the greatest games of the last generation, and of all time. \n\nI played over 100 hours of FNV on my PS3, before I became a PC gamer. I've now put in 55 additional hours and I'm still not done with it. I'm not even close to playing through the amazing mods, and quests this game has. There is easily over 100 hours of content, without replaying any of it. Its absolutely unreal how much content is in this game and how fun it is to play it all.\n\nThe Story of FNV starts with you getting shot in the head. Pretty weird start, but it works, it makes me interested. Why did I get shot? Who shot me? Why did he shoot me over [SPOILER DELETED]? You find all this out over the course of the story, that plays itself out greatly. On top of an indepth main quest, you have detailed side quests to go along with it. The side quests do a great job of tying the story together while also telling its own. I don't want to go on forever here, but if you want comparisons, the story in FNV is exponentially better than the story in Fallout 3. And I enjoyed the story in Fallout 3 quite a bit. \n\nThe combat system works in an interesting way. While you do have the basic FPS mechanics, you also have VATS, which makes it work in sort of a psuedo-Turn based way. You target certain body parts, tell your guy to shoot, then he does. Its pretty satisfying, especially seeing an opponents head go flying in pieces off of his body. Pretty satisfying combat. I do wish sniping was done a bit better, I feel like when I'm trying to snipe opponents from far away, VATS doesn't really want to cooperate, which is unfortunate. Pretty much my only complaint about the combat. This last part isn't really about combat, but it is gameplay so I'll mention it here. The game implements a hardcore mode, which forces you to eat, sleep and drink along with making combat more difficult and companions killable. I've never done a full hardcore playthrough, but I do enjoy the mode for the most part. Killable companions is bullshit though, I use a mod to keep that part off.\n\nThis is getting really long, so I'll make my last point about the world. This is probably the major weakness of the game, if I was to point out any. I don't really think there is anything majorly wrong with the world, but at the beginning it sort of feels like you can only go one way. If you try to go north, you're almost guarenteed to get slaughtered, unless you turn god mode on. Mid level(about level 15) and on, you can pretty much go anywhere in the world and you don't have to worry about dying. The world feels good and exploration is fun, but it definitely feels like its forcing a linear path for the first 1/4 of the main quest.\n\nFallout: New Vegas is my favorite Single player FPS of all time, and if you've never played this gem, you should pick it up immediately. I promise, you'll love it.\n\n[h1][u] Buy At Full Price [h1][u]", "timestamp_created": 1397699471, "timestamp_updated": 1454548417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 382, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.906493067741394043", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34493705": {"recommendationid": "34493705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199246307", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548983193}, "language": "english", "review": "You take a sip from your trusty Vault 13 Canteen", "timestamp_created": 1503710633, "timestamp_updated": 1503710633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 188, "votes_funny": 142, "weighted_vote_score": "0.88804250955581665", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20840552": {"recommendationid": "20840552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039479105", "num_games_owned": 501, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 14541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547295417}, "language": "english", "review": "[Speech 95/65] You should buy the game, it`s worth it.\n[Terrifying Presence] If you don't buy this game, i will make sure you never see the light of the day again.\n[Barter] This great game for this low, low price?!

This is my take though, for anyone interested.\n\nNCR:\n+- Old world values, god bless America (?).\n+ Gender equality, arguably even more than in the old world. Treated equally as soldiers and leaders.\n+ Idealists. The President's speech is pretty heartwarming even though it's deceiving and fueled by lies.\n- Overextension, their obsession with controlling everything leads to them being utterly incompetent at every front.\n- Greed, they take what they want, planned to annex New Vegas for their own benefit, never mind Mr. House or the locals.\n- Corruption. As Caesar puts it, they are a \"loose conglomerate of individuals looking out for themselves\".\n\nLegion:\n+- Ancient rome, with all the benefits and drawbacks that brings.\n+ Ideological purity, \"the will of Caesar is the will of the Legion\". Caesar brings \"the torch of knowledge\" to the wastes.\n+ Impressively competent. In a few decades Caesar formed a power to rival the NCR, that's built over several generations.\n- Child soldiers, implied by Ranger Andy. Kind Of unnerved by that one. Never seen ingame, but it'd never pass legally.\n- Women are \"property\" and \"below notice\". If you're a female courier, they'll comment on \"trying you out\". Stranger Danger.\n- Extremely unforgiving, ends justify the means. Crucifixion, massacres, terrorism. All for the \"greater good\", a Legion rule.\n\nMr. House:\n+ An immortal supercomputer man machine god. If you're a fan of the world of Asimov, maybe you'd prefer his rule.\n+ \"An economic and technological visionary\". His own smug words, though many sources confirm him as a genius.\n+ Long term plan for humanity, says he'll have people in space searching for new worlds in a century.\n- Autocratic, claims answering to a board of directors would only impede progress. Perhaps not a typical tyrant, but practically.\n-+ Immortal leader, infinite term. He'd probably never let go of power were he to completely acquire it.\n- He's human, despite the machines he surrounds himself with. Likely he'd get bored. Corrupt. Sociopathic. Terrifying. just look at what happened to the courier once you gave him multiple playthroughs, more than one lifetime.\n\nIndependent, Yes Man:\n+-A complete wildcard. It'd depend too much on the courier to be completely generalized in pros and cons. Still...\n- As general Oliver said, NCR would be angered. You'd be caught between NCR and Legion, and that securitron army doesn't really replenish or grow unless a way to make more was found.\n\nCurrently, I'm leaning towards the Legion. The world of fallout doesn't need the casinos, prostit***s, the chemed-up and drunken old world shadow of New Vegas. A cleansing of Vegas is completely in order. Plus, with the legion finally getting its rome, perhaps Caesar could start implementing the non-warlike aspects of the roman empire, and really establish a pax romana. Playing as a female courier means that a coin of her would be minted and spread across his empire. In time, that might bring some level of equality, being honored next to Caesar himself, just as Tandi being honored is thought to have brought equality to the NCR. The courier wouldn't have to be a devil, but by being fair and good hearted in all dealings might easen the transition of legion rule over Vegas and make it somewhat more endurable. If nothing else, perhaps it will cause the NCR to shape up a bit. \n\nOn second thought, nah. Wild Card all the way.

The New California Republic is back, as is the Brotherhood and Enclave (or what remains of it). Veterans of the franchise will notice a few subtle nods to previous games in the franchise, such as Poseidon Energy and a few characters coming from locales in Fallout 1 and 2.\n\nUnlike Fallout 3, New Vegas maintains consistency in its lore with previous titles in the franchise. The Brotherhood is a reclusive organization rather than an army of ''do-gooders', the Enclave isn't the powerful organization it once was, and Super Mutants aren't all over the place for no reason. It's no surprise that the creators of Fallout : NV are also the minds behind Fallout 1 and 2, before the studio closed and Bethesda bought out the franchise. The post-apocalyptic world is still fresh in their minds and care was applied when creating the world and lore so that it meshes with previous entries.\n\nNew to this entry is the faction system. Whereas Fallout 3 automatically made the Brotherhood the 'good guys' and you only had one choice in the ending (tamper with the Purifier or not), New Vegas lets you side with one of four factions, affecting the New Vegas power struggle and the ending. Whomever you decide to side with, they carry their own mainline quests to win control of the Hoover Dam. The faction system also carries it's own subset of reputation; a faction may despise you (attacking you on sight) or idolize you. Reputation is gained or lost by finishing quests for a faction and/or siding with them when presented with the option. When doing the mainline quests for a faction, you'll slowly lose karma with the others until you're attacked by them on-sight.\n\nWhilst siding with a faction for an ending is excellent, don't place too much thought on juggling reputations whilst exploring and doing sidequests. Whilst exploring the Mojave, its in your best interest to side with the NCR when presented with the option; they have camps all over the map, they account for at least 25% of all sidequests (estimate) and a potential companion (and his quest) requires NCR fame. The only factions you'll have to juggle rep with outside of the main quest arcs are the Legion and NCR, all other factions have peaceful resolutions if presented with an issue between the two of them. Most of the time it'll be a question of whether or not to fu*k over the Legion, since the quest will come from an NCR official. The Legion has ONE camp in the game (the other reached through the storyline), and no sidequests so always side against them. Don't worry, there's a point in the main storyline where negative rep is reset with either the Legion or NCR (or both), allowing you to do all sidequests and then side with the Legion in the main story.\n\nSo it's a coin toss: either you appreciate the ability to do all sidequests in a single playthrough without having to worry too much about factions and reputation (which I believe), or you believe the system failed since it's effect outside of the main story quest arcs is non-existant. Perhaps the Brotherhood and Followers should've fought more, perhaps concurrent sidequests between two factions should've been introduced, forcing you to balance reputations. Or maybe you aren't a fan of having to play through a game multiple times, especially when you invested a ton of hours into one playthrough. \n\nWhat is clear is that the Legion, despite being an important faction in the game, has VERY little representation in the game. This is due to time constraints: with only 18 months in development Obsidian had to leave everything east of the Colorado River an unexplorable area, originally being Legion territory. There's also an entire western portion of the map blocked off by mountains, and the north eastern end of the map as well. The game also has a significantly lower amount of interiors (buildings you can go into) as compared to Fallout 3, and the Mojave wasteland is littered with meaningless locations (abandoned shacks, empty areas with no interiors). You don't have to look too far to see time constraints everywhere. All to the game's detriment: I would've preferred more interiors with PC terminals and notes delving into inhabitants lives or situations around the Mojave.\n\nFallout 3 did exploration better: more interiors and towns. But Fallout NV does everything else better: lore, story, writing. Fallout NV is more of a Fallout title than Fallout 3 was, and if you're a fan of the franchise you'll love the care Obsidian put in handling its congruity with the other titles.

This game has endless replay value. Four major faction storylines with around 5 other faction sidequest lines, dozens upon dozens of sidequests, dozens of unmarked quests. In my hundreds of hours playing this on Xbox I still haven't completed all of them. Over 188 locations (not including unmarked locations), 316 with the four major DLCs. I still haven't discovered every one in a single playthrough. As far as choices go, this game remains unmatched. Dialouge gives you a dizzying array of choices and options on how to interect with characters, solve problems, complete quests, etc. Weapon choice is equally endless and beats both Fallout 3 and 4 in variation (though admittingly many weapons are useless later in the game). On top of that, most weapons come with various mods you can collect throughout your exploration. There's also dozens of unique weapons to add to your already stocked cabinet of firepower. In terms of overall content, this game is packed to the brim.\n\nStorywise, this game is equally impressive. Without spoiling anything, a simple revenge story turns into a complex 4-way war between the major factions, with you at the center. Factions like Caesar's Legion, New California Republic, Mr. House, Brotherhood of Steel, Boomers, Great Khans, Powder Gangers, White Glove Society and more await for you to meet them and decide their fates and quell their internal stuggles. Each also come with their own unique and interesting backstories.\n\nMy only real gripe with this game are the bugs. This game is notorious for the amount of gamebreaking bugs it had on release. The first set of patchnotes even excluded a description of all the quest script bugs it fixed (well over 300). However, several patches later, many of the bugs are gone. Given how big this game is, there are still many remaining, BUT with access to unoffical patches and console commands on PC, they aren't really a big problem, if at all. Oh and by the way, this game still boasts a big community of people still playing and making mods for this game. Not just graphics or weapon mods either. Some of the bigger ones are comparable to full blown DLC (Ghoulville is my favorite).\n\nI've played many RPGs throughout the years. Fallout 4 may be bigger, Skyrim more ambitious, The Witcher 3 more cinematic, KOTOR more innovative, but I can say without a shadow of a doubt, Fallout: New Vegas is the one you will get the most out of in terms of content, storytelling and replayability.

Not because their content is too hard but their expectations of what players want to enjoy are different. While seemingly similar in their mechanics, both games diverge in what players expect to enjoy in a \"Fallout\" game. \n\nIf you have read my review of Fallout 3, then you know I consider New Vegas the more refined game. Traits, player-choice influenced quest-lines, the faction systems, and the gray morality are important factors for what makes NV so great. However, it's the world-building that puts NV as one of the finest examples of open-world games. \n\nAs someone who has thought of open-world games as the death of narratives from the Ubisoft games to the missed opportunities of games like Risen, Obsidian has forever changed my opinion on their storytelling merits. NV doesn't tell the greatest story nor the smartest; it tells a world of tales of your interactions that shape the Mojave one grain of sand at a time.\n\n[h1]Nuka Cola or Sunset Sarsaparilla?[/h1]\n\nBefore I discuss the importance of NV's strongest suit, I do want to go over the improvements of NV. Many fans I think will consider liking F3 or NV to be something similar to the question, \"Coke or Pepsi?\"\n\nWhile both games are mechanically the same, there are noticeable differences. For example, F:NV focuses more-so on the role-playing mechanics by making its perks more unique, sometimes beneficial with consequences or adding a new level of challenge. F3 simply focuses on numbers and how to make them better. I found that by Lv 43 my character in NV still had room for growth whereas my F3 character was maxed out before LV 13.\n\nQuests in NV seem more shorter and to the point than F3. (Admittedly, the travel time between each quest could be the reason for why they feel more brief in NV.) The Mojave is a more compacted, content-rich area than D.C. which might be great to some (like me) and a negative to others. What NV makes up for instead is how questlines can feed into other quests seemlessly by the player's exploration and choices.\n\nEven when it comes to the FPS mechanics, the iron-sights, weapon mods and various ammo types for every gun make the barebones gunplay of F3 much more tolerable. (I find the repair/ammo-crafting benches too restricting on junk to ever warrant using them.) I hardly ever use VATS in F3 or NV unless I want to get headshots on Deathclaws.\n\nSpeaking of Deathclaws, enemies in NV are not leveled to the player from the get-go. They are given a fixed level\u2014and scaling later\u2014which makes enemies more consistent in NV. This change does come at the cost of making the early part of NV more linear as you have to loop around the road to get to Vegas as your first major quest-goal. However, like in Risen, the game tells you this through the enemies' difficulty and there are quests/paths along a more linear beginning than F3.\n\nI personally prefer the grim-humor flavor of the post-post apocalypse of the Mojave over the post-apocalypse consistency of D.C. Your taste may vary, but I hope to explain why NV is the superior game.\n\n[h1]It's All A Matter of Context[/h1]\n\nIf you have played a Bethesda game before, then you will more often notice a problem of its open-world design: The world always feels disjointed. \n\nQuests in Bethesda games have been focused on telling individual stories with little to no relation to one another. Tone-shifts, relevance to the over-arching storyline, and other narrative pitfalls suffer as a result. While some fans may enjoy this format, the result is a world that feels more lifeless by their lack of context.\n\nFallout 3's main-questline is indicative of this problem. You go from exploring the Museum of Natural History to get a radar dish for a DJ, to wandering to a city made of a shipwrecked vessel to learn about your father's science project, then exploring a Vault with a murder-simulation program, and then later stumbling upon a society of children. \n\nIn contrast, NV begins with the town of Goodsprings caught up in the much larger conflict of the Legion encroaching upon the NCR claimed settlements of the Mojave. A gang of escaped convicts harass the people of Goodsprings who have stolen their explosives from the NCR mining outpost of Sloan to exert their power. (The result being that the explosions have lured out Deathclaws along the road of Sloan.) This gang has taken the town of Primm under their rule as they fight off the NCR stationed there, and the gang's other settlement Nipton is under attack by the Legion.\n\nAs seen in this one example, conflicts in New Vegas feed back into each other and expand upon the world it tells. This description of events is simply the background window-dressing to your actions as you can side with Goodsprings, the convict gangs, the NCR or the Legion. Your interactions stay within the story's guidelines of NV. Questlines also can link-back up with previous or new areas, and the order of these quests can be stories you create for yourself (ex. Jacobtown and Black Mountain).\n\t\nWhat can also be seen in this one example is the careful attention to details. Why are Deathclaws roaming Sloan? Why are the NCR defending Primm/Goodsprings? Even in its environmental design, there is a level of detail of the farming area of Goodspring to explain how a town can survive. Something that was utterly lacking in Fallout 3.\n\nThe reward from all of this attention to detail is that the world of NV feels more alive than it actually is because the world makes sense. Are there still tone-shifts or missing details? Yes, especially with the cringe-worthy sexual tensions and swear-words. However, these moments are far less abundant and offer a dark sense of humor in a post-post apocalypse.\n \n[h1]\"I've Got Heartaches by the Number\"[/h1]\n\nI would be lying if I said I thought NV is absolutely perfect. \n\nWhile I praise the game's means of storytelling and of player-choices in the overall game there are some downsides that I think some people may enjoy. It took me years to be stubborn enough to play to Vegas because I was so used to F3's freeform exploration.\n\nThe narrative hook of NV is not one to keep you invested if you don't care to learn more about the conflicts around the Mojave. Even then, the plot of the Courier is very sparse and not very personal. (On the otherhand, the freeform nature of the Courier lets you make him/her be whoever you want.)\n\nThe rushed schedule of the game has had some impact on its development. F3's engine has really shown its age with how much NV has to restrict itself, whether it be the barren New Vegas or the amounts of gated loading screens. Not only are aspects like this have to be rushed but even some interactions aren't coded in.\n\nFor example, when trying to set a truce between the NCR and the Brotherhood of Steel, if you had gotten rid of the previous Elder then the option for truce does not exist. It's not that the new one is arrogant and won't agree to it--the game is not programmed to understand that option. These type of instances are very, very, very rare but they are a stain on the freeform nature of the game. \n\nOn the flipside, it is really telling how much trust Obsidian has with its player when the game has one--and only one--unkillable NPC, the Yes Man (aside from children and Victor in the early part of the game). Fallout 4 is littered with these unkillable NPCs while New Vegas offers multiple optional objectives/paths for almost every quest. \n\nIf Obsidian was given more time to flesh out the game and on a better engine, then I think this game would be a perfect masterpiece. (In spite of its somewhat lackluster personal narrative.) Instead, it's a masterpiece with a few smudges you have to accept.\n\nWith all these gripes being said...

It's impossible not to love him. <3\n\nHow about factions, do they beat the Brotherhood of Steel or The Institute?\nHell fucking yes, any day, any time.

It managed to feel open, yet constrained. I had things to do, but nobody to force me to do them. A true masterpiece of a roleplaying game.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nI'm writing this not ten minutes after finishing my first playthough, which lasted nearly 40 hours. 40 hours of time well spent, and I am preparing for my next playthrough. No other game has had me this excited to repeat it. I suppose that's good. Most games I play, well, they get one pass. One shot. One game. Then I relegate them to the \"Played\" category.\n\nNot Fallout: New Vegas\n\nThough it has been finished, this masterpiece retains a spot atop my Favorites list. How? Let's get into that.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nFallout: New Vegas opens with an iconic scene. The courier (you, the player) is caught by a stranger. It's time to cash out. You've made your last delivery kid. Truth is, the game was rigged from the start. You might know those lines. I did skip a few. Here's a challenge: Fill them in.\n\nAfter this cutscene, you're awoken in the house of Doc Mitchell, a uhh, a doctor, who patched you up. Create your character, and get a little exposition. They, open the door. Meet your new home.\n\nThe wasteland.\n\nA vast, desolate expanse. Filled with scavengers, filled with thieves, filled with mutant enemies. But, filled with something else. Filled with a people. Filled with families. Filled with humanity, trying their best to survive against all odds. Fighting the giant insects pounding at their door, hunting for blood.\n\nYou meet this vast place, from the relative safety of a small town called Goodsprings.\n\nWhen I first entered the wasteland, I had a similar reaction as with PlanetSide 2: Holy hell that's big. I opened my Pip-Boy, and took a gander at all the empty space, waiting to be populated by cities, towns, the Strip, and so much more waiting to be discovered.\n\nI wasn't thrust immediately into combat. I wasn't thrust immediately into a tough decision. I wasn't thrown immediately into an exposition dump so lengthy I was bored. Instead, I was thrust into the open arms of a small town. With people. And I met those people. And those people had ideas. They had lives. Most other games fail to show this. NPCs are merely their title: shopkeeper, clerk, janitor, whatever. These people were, in that sense, real.\n\nWhen I was told that they could be in danger, I never felt anything like it. Somehow, in the short amount of time I had been with the people at Goodsprings, I cared for them. They became almost like family. I didn't want to see them hurt.\n\nAnd that wasn't the only time.\n\nYou may know about companions, and there is one that I took on. (Won't say for spoilers) I took them along with me, developed a relationship with them, got to know them, talked to them, used their skills. When the time came, many hours in, I had to make a choice. There were two goals for me. One of which meant turning my companion against me. The things I felt afterwards... I was not prepared. No game had broken through me before. I was strong, but here I stumbled. I only wish more games could repeat this, and come as close as this one.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nI guess I've been talking about feelings for a little while, and I suppose every review needs a gameplay section. Hmm. It's good. Very good. Mostly intuitive, though a few things required a quick google. For the record, I played on Hardcore mode.\n\nPip-Boy takes a bit of getting used to for me, a first time user, but it was second nature by the end of the game. I'm not exactly a fan of list-based inventories, but it was fine.\n\nVATS was good as a targeting system, but I got so heavily reliant on it that all my shots became simple RNG rather than actual skill shooting. I suppose that's fine, I didn't have a problem with it.\n\nMovement was good. When is it not though, really?\n\nInventory management was tricky. I started vigorously cleaning my stash, trying to keep it very low so I never got overburdened. By the end of it, well, I had 23 wine bottles just sitting there. How did you think it went?\n\nAnd of course, Hardcore mode's specialty: ammo weight (a pain, for sure) along with hunger, thirst, and sleep. Honestly, I only slept once. I guess it's just because of all the Nuka-Cola I was drinking instead of Stimpaks (which I had plenty of, by the way). Hunger was only a minor inconvenience, but thirst... I recommend keeping a ton of water on you. Don't want to be caught thirsty.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nMusic is great. Loved almost all of the tracks, but the ones at Hoover Dam get a bit repetitive after a while. Maybe it's just me. I discovered the radio function very late into the game, but once I did, oh why did it take me so long. For God's sake, turn on the radio for some of the best songs I've heard in a game.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nI suppose, in this day and age, one must rate the graphics in a videogame. Of course, Fallout: New Vegas does not have the best graphics. Not by a longshot. Keep in mind though, it came out in 2010. So it's not new. I found it bearable. Not the greatest, but never getting in the way of my enjoyment. Gameplay and story before graphics, and I will stand by that.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nA note on the bugginess:\nYeah, it's buggy. A nice friend of mine mentioned a few mods one should use while playing the game. I recommend you use them as well, lest your game crash and leave you with a save multiple hours old. (Which I have done, luckily not a crash but I did forget to save for a solid 4 hours. Christ, this game can really keep you interested. Two o'clock and I finally remembered to eat lunch) Anyway, the mods:\n\nNew Vegas Script Extender: http://nvse.silverlock.org/\nNew Vegas Anti-Crash: https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/53635\nFallout: New Vegas 4GB Patcher: https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62552\n\n----------------------------------\n\nTL; DR\n\n1) Read it you lazy bastard\n\n2) Fallout: New Vegas is one of the greatest games I have ever played.
