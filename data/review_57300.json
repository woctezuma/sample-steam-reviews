It puts you on the edge of madness and terror and keeps you there without ever pushing you to the point where it because mundane.\n\nThe story is actually very engaging, with the protagonist being an Englishman suffering amnesia, stumbling around a dark castle searching for answers. But those answer are unlikely to bring you joy. However whilst the story is horrific enough, the true brilliance of this game is the way it injects you with a feeling of utter helplessness and despair. You never feel like you have any options other than to run and hide, and even those options feel temporary, simply putting off the inevitable for a little longer. And yet run and hide you do. \n\nAnd no game I have ever played has used darkness so effectively. It is both your best friend and greatest enemy at the same time. It will hide you from the terrors, but it will expose you to the insanity brewing in your own mind. So you flit from light to dark, never able to truly feel comfortable in either.\n\nEverything about this game works well to produce a true feeling of fear. The sound and the visuals are great and the game mechanics are actually very cool. Pushing and pulling items around, moving chairs in front of doors, it all works to give that genuine horror movie experience.\n\nIf you like horror games this is a must have.

What scares one person to hell, could make somebody else just raise an eyebrow, or even come across as comical to yet another gamer. Opinions on what makes a good horror game do vary accordingly, but amidst all these discussions, there's one game that stands out: [i]Amnesia: The Dark Descent[/i]. Almost everybody who has played this game, concedes that it is exceptionally scary, and thus succeeds wonderfully as a horror game.\n\nThe first of the two [i]Amnesia[/i] games, it was released just five years ago, in september 2010. It's not the first horror game by its developer, Frictional Games, who earlier made the [i]Penumbra[/i] games, but it's certainly the title that made Frictional Games famous. With the hype around the upcoming release of [i]Soma[/i], yet another Frictional title, playing through their best known horror game yet only seemed appropriate, and long overdue.\n\nActually I started this game already three times earlier this year, every time not finding the courage to move on after the first hour or so, out of pure fear. I only play this kind of games when it's dark outside, using headphones, in order to let them develop their full scaring potential, but with [i]Amnesia: The Dark Descent[/i] this kind of approach just looked impossible. The past couple of weeks I finally found the courage to persevere (in complete darkness), but I was only able to play the game in small pieces, only half an hour or so on end, after which I literally had to recover.\n\nThis may seem like exaggerated, but it's not. This game is by far the scariest I've ever played. Playing as Daniel, you have to re-discover who you are and what you're doing in a medieval castle somewhere deep in the German woods. As the game progresses, the story poses more and more questions, and only at the very end did all the pieces come together for me. But it's not the story itself that's particularly scary. It's the way the game puts the player in an extremely vulnerable position, without any means of defense (no swords or guns in this one!) and only some tinderboxes and a lantern as a means to progress through the increasingly unsettling surroundings.\n\nThe game is by far the darkest I've ever played. Darkness is actually transformed into one of the game's defining elements: when standing in darkness, Daniel slowly but surely turns mad, and the only way to counter this is either to light some candles with the tinderboxes, or to light your lantern. Since lantern oil is quite scarce, I found myself constantly trying to save it as much as possible. There is a constant looming danger in the form of monsters, who are seldomly to been seen but impose terror upon the player by sound or just by thought. For when a monster finds you, it's almost surely instant death. The game manages to strike the perfect balance between slowly progressing episodes where I was fumbling around in the dark, hiding for monsters and looking for clues or letters, and some scenes where the only option was: run!\n\nIt's hard to describe in words exactly why this game got so deep under my skin, though, because it terrified me on an even deeper level that has nothing to do with graphics or game mechanics. I think the theme of man turning into a monster even worse than any monster imagineable struck a resonating chord inside me. I found myself screaming out loud at times, mostly out of utter disgust at what was happening. The game had a very unsettling effect on my, and probably that's why it took me several tries to play and finish it. It's a masterpiece in its genre, yet to be trumped.\n\n[b]Very highly recommended, but not for the faint of heart, nor for heart patients[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1442788126, "timestamp_updated": 1442788126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 192, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.898636281490325928", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24522932": {"recommendationid": "24522932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062178169", "num_games_owned": 981, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519253240}, "language": "english", "review": "After spending days thinking about what to write in this review, I finally have come to the conclusion that mere words cannot summarize this gem of a game. I could write tremendously long essays describing what makes [b]Amnesia: The Dark Descent[/b] an unique masterpiece, but it's to no avail. One would have to play the game in order to understand its beauty and its charm...\n\n[i]\"Wait a second, I thought this was a horror game? ...\"[/i] . It is. It's a terrifying journey in its own rights, from start to the end. But I can't help it, the [b]atmosphere[/b] of Amnesia is one of the most, if not the most refined one I have ever witnessed in a video game. The Brennenburg Castle is a truly memorable place. During the first half of the game, you will be exploring the highly architectural, yet haunting chambers, familiarizing yourself with the gameplay mechanics, the story of the main character and the lore. I'm not going to go into lots of detail about the second half, but I'll just summarize this part with a quote that I think fits it best: \"All good things come to an end.\", as you will understand what the beautiful castle hides, buried deep within.\n\nThe story of [b]Amnesia: The Dark Descent[/b] does not lack at all in quality, but nor is it the most intriguing or most interesting. However, you may have to give the game a second playthrough to fully understand the lore. You're playing as Daniel, an archaeologist. The plot spawns after Daniel retrieves a strange, mystical orb from a tomb in Algeria. From that moment on, he starts getting nightmares and the people he interacts with end up brutally killed sooner or later, by a strange force. He realizes he's being haunted by this orb and that, in the end, he will end up dead too, so he decides to follow the instructions from a strange letter he recieved, signed by Alexander, baron of Brennenburg. Most of the narrative will be brought to the player by finding notes and bits of Daniel's journal, scattered across the castle, but there are also occasional flashbacks, which will give you an insight into what happened in various places, throughout your journey. Story length's neither too small or big. Expect around 10-15 hours of playtime, if you also want to collect every journal fragment. It's worth noting, though, that this game suffers from the replay value factor. I don't see myself replaying it anytime soon as there's not any content to it besides the main story. Then, you may ask, why do so many people still play this game? The answer lies in the great implementation the devs added to the game: community made maps, aka [i]custom stories[/i]. These are (for the most part) completely new settings created by various people, with new stories and environments (they're made using Amnesia's original assets, so it goes without saying: don't expect something as fresh as a brand new game). There are hundreds upon hundreds of them, fairly easy to find on the Internet and there are also Steam Guides regarding which ones are worth your time, or even how to create your own one!\n\nLet's move on and talk about the sound quality. This is another element where Amnesia shines brightly. Music is fitting and the sound effects are top-notch. The monster's growl will make your skin crawl and when he spots you, a ghastly music will commence. But all in all, when there is nothing dangerous nearby, you will be surrounded by a charming melody, one that immaculately fits the game's vista.\n\nGraphics of this game are quite impressive for such a small team (at that time?). Of course, they cannot compete with big name's engines, but nonetheless Amnesia does look good and the visuals have never been an immersion-breaker. The optimization suffers in certain areas, notably places with many sources of light, where the framedrops tend to flutter. I do not have a beast of a rig, but my specs highly surpass the recommended ones on the store page. It's nothing of a big issue to me, though, and the FPS never dropped below 30.\n\nThe gameplay is interesting, to say the least. I don't see often horror titles blending puzzles in such a non-intrusive way, like Amnesia does. The puzzle element is on point here, you will run quite often into trouble, doors needing keys to be unlocked, machinery that needs more power, escaping from narrow areas etc. The monsters are here to give you a hard time and will do their best to stop you from advancing. Unfortunately, one thing I did not like is that, for the most part, the enemies will unrender after a while. Thus, you may find a good place to hide and wait for the beast to just go away... I wish they would patrol the area instead.\nHowever, the puzzles are intelligent and non-repetitive. Sometimes, the answer is not as obvious as it seems, or it requires the player to read some notes, advance some more in the story etc.\nAnother unique element here is the \"sanity\" system. Basically, staying in the dark for too long, looking at the monster or witnessing unexpected events will drain your lucidity, giving Daniel headaches and ultimately hallucinations, collapsing on the ground, allerting the monsters, along with different screen distortions. Always conserve your lantern oil, as most of the game takes place in dark surroundings. An interesting trivia, when your sanity is dangerously low, some elements of the game will change, such as Alexander's portrait on the wall paintings or some corpses appearing in various locations.\n\nThe horror aspect is top-notch, rarely has any game made my heart beat this fast when being chased by the enemy. In Amnesia, you have no means of defending yourself. Darkness can be your foe, but also your best friend when it comes to hiding. The monsters are much faster than you, they can break down doors and detect you if you stare at them for too long. They're also very susceptible of sounds, so don't attempt to run past them without being seen. And under the worst circumstances, you have to make a run for the nearest chamber and lock yourself inside, alternatively using elements from the environment to block the monster from reaching you.\n\n[h1][u]Summary:[/u][/h1]\n\n[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b] + Magnificent atmosphere, the Castle of Brennenburg is a spot that will stick with players for a long time;\n+ Great and interesting puzzles, with original solutions;\n+ Immersive music and sounds, mixing ambient noises with heart-pumping melody, accordingly;\n+ Engaging storyline, may call for a 2nd playthrough in order to fully comprehend it;\n+ Terrifying horror element, you are completely defenseless in front of the monsters, they can chase you down relatively quick and kill you in a small number of hits;\n+ Unique system of Health+Sanity, in Amnesia you also have to take care of your brain status; witnessing unexpected events, staying in the darkness for too long will drag your sanity down and you will eventually collapse;\n+ Difficulty is balanced, the game will not throw its most dangerous enemies at the player until he's prepared to face them;\n+ Tons of user-made custom stories, that keep this game's player base alive and bring new, different concepts;\n\n[b][u]Neutral:[/u][/b] +/- The lantern runs out of oil pretty fast, which might prove to be a bother for new players, leaving them facing the darkness for a long time;\n+/- Dying has no real consequences; the game saves quite often and it will spawn you back in a safe chamber, along with the items you have retrieved;\n\n[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b] - No replay value; after you understood the storyline, there's no real point in coming back to it (besides the custom stories, of course);\n- Monsters disappear after a while, which massively takes away from the challenge factor;\n- Occasional bugs and glitches, aswell as sound stutterings;\n\n[b]Amnesia: The Dark Descent[/b] is a king of horror genre and, by far, Frictional's peak game.

This anecdote does not describe how terrifying Amnesia is as a game, rather how effective it taps into the fears of the unknown, man\u2019s own worst creation. Had I realized how Amnesia has less to do with survival horror and more to do with walking-sims the illusion would not have become self-inflicting. When you strip away all the smokes and mirrors, it becomes obvious how often the player is responsible behind scaring themselves rather than what is truly happening. \n\nThis statement does not discredit Amnesia as an effective horror game. On the contrary, Amnesia embodies how horror should be treated as it instills dreading anticipation rather than moments to be feared.  \n\n[h1]\u201dHello, Darkness, My Old Friend\u2026\u201d[/h1]\n\nWhile some may continue to use the term \u201cwalking simulator\u201d as a derogatory, Amnesia perhaps vindicates the idea. Even with the puzzles, the generous resource-management and the \u201chiding/running\u201d mechanics, Amnesia is a game without much breadth compared to the depth behind its experience.\n\nFor starters, the initial hours never rely on enemies to make the player afraid; instead, the usage of background noise and the usage of the darkness/sanity-meter creates the illusion of being pursued. Many would-be horror games fail in their execution to imitate Frictional Games by simply recreating situations of sensory deprivation without manipulating the player. Unless you know from hearsay or you have experienced the game yourself, there are plenty of tricks to never make the player feel alone in the darkness. This attitude is present throughout the game even though players have more mechanics to use and many more threats to be afraid.  \n \nWhile the puzzles become more engaging, the number of forced encounters makes a game devoid of anything other than immersion. It may be surprising to learn 75-80% of encounters can be avoided simply by waiting for enemies to vanish. This aspect does not ruin the experience because it is explained in the lore, yet it often is used to scare the player into a corner or to heighten the tension for a set piece. Aside from a water-monster, a Shadow Chase and one encounter with an Infected, most threats you face do not need to be overcome at all. Some players may find this lack of challenge disheartening, yet the lower number of deaths and the inability to distinguish a fake versus a real threat keeps the illusion intact. However, some levels are narrowed hallways that often showcase this mechanic is a crutch, a design limitation rather than a technical one.\n\nThe other mechanics in Amnesia often feel adequate if they only serve the purpose to create a sense of dread. Perhaps the most annoying inclusion is the sanity meter, which would be interesting if it didn\u2019t mess up my mouse and FOV with little gameplay changes. Dark Corners of the Earth utilized this idea with far more interesting consequences. Tinderboxes and lantern fuel are quite abundant, yet there are many instances where you may overuse them. Health potions seems like a non-issue because you cannot simply take more than one or two hits, and if an enemy catches up with you it\u2019s game-over. The inventory system and the \u201copen-ended\u201d order of linear objectives\u2014both of which enhance the puzzles\u2014are really the only additions to benefit Amnesia as a game. \n\n[h1]Horror, the Storytelling Jack-in-the-Box[/h1]\n\nAside from various elements of gameplay enhancing the horror behind Amnesia, the storytelling also lends some credit to enhancing the game as a piece of horror fiction. Horror is a genre you have to go into with the expectations that it will attempt to frighten you, which often makes the audience more critical of the plot-structure due to assumptions about subversive moments like almost reaching the exit or about other characters\u2019 motivations. These stories can still be scary because how that fear is conveyed and what you must do creates the tension behind the flimsy plots, which often evaporates towards the end because that discomfort is released. The problem with Amensia\u2019s narrative isn\u2019t that it leaves many mysteries or details unexamined but rather how much subtlety is behind its plot and its motivations for what is a very classic horror story.\n\nAlthough the term Lovecraftian is misapplied to many horror media, the comparison is apt with Amnesia if you have his Poe-like stories in mind such as The Rats in the Walls. Some unspeakable, unimaginable, indescribable horror manifests itself to the protagonist, which further disrupts his or her mental state over time. Eventually, characters break down, consumed by their disruptive thoughts as they result in a tragic end. Most of the time, these endings are unsatisfying, implying something to the audience as a shocking twist or it may border on the absurd as the infamous \u201cI can hear it coming up the stairs as I write this!\u201d trope. \n\nDaniel\u2019s story mirrors many elements of this classic plot, and most remain effective. It\u2019s character-driven involving Daniel, Alexander and a host of other victims with an indescribable entity only referred to as The Shadow. Waking up as the new Daniel and how he gets roped into this mess are effective as the Shadow prevents his escape. While the rationale behind the amnesia is never fully explained without extensive lore reading, its purpose does follow the archetype of a character reaching their mental limits. Unfortunately, many elements of this narrative remain obscured by the way information is communicated as well as the lack of context behind the three solutions which both results in an unsatisfying ending. \n\nAlthough there are many games before and after Amnesia that relied on notes to piecemeal a plot, the writing is perhaps far too subtle for its own good. Certain mysteries like the Orbs and the castle do not affect the storyline because they are details meant to be left up to the player to answer. Characters outside Daniel and Alexander, however, often will be vague at best due to how they are presented only through snippets of text scattered across the game. The most notable example of this problem is Agrippa who is tied into one of the three endings. Scattered messages give the player some impression, yet when the player meets him it feels as if there was meant to be a stronger connection between him and Daniel. Alexander also only gets exposure through Daniel, so his goal of \u201creturning home\u201d is never given adequate explanation. The only ending that does feel like closure to the narrative is what many label \u201cthe bad\u201d ending as it ends the story of the former Daniel, yet it still may seem disappointing as there is no surprise nor does it illuminate the important questions.\n\n[h1]The Oldest and Strongest Emotion of Mankind is Fear, the Fear of the Unknown[/h1]\n\nAlthough I do not believe I am an expert\u2014nor am I a massive fan\u2014of horror media, Amnesia is an experience that manages to be as evocative of what makes great horror years later. Does that make it one of the best games ever made? Perhaps not if you see through the illusions. \n\nWhat should be remembered is why Amnesia remains brilliant. It\u2019s not the emphasis on being helpless; it\u2019s not the violence nor the gore; nor is it the result of its classic horror story. It\u2019s the atmosphere, the immersive elements, and the manipulation of player\u2019s expectations of how to be afraid that shows its pedigree. Fear is an emotion out of the ignorance of what you do not comprehend, dissolved away with knowledge; in the moment from sanity, fear exposes more questions than answers to what being alone in the dark shall ever illuminate about yourself.

It's not because of the amount of monsters, either not the jump scares (Fortunately they don't exist in that game). You wanna know what one thing making this game a true masterpiece? I'll tell you, imagination.\n\nMost of the times we are scared, because of things that are simply happening, like for example self-opening doors, windows, creepy screams from the basements of the castle etc. In that situation you immediately think that there is monster nearby, but you just realised that was a false alarm. You can also hear monster's scream, but that doesn't mean that you'll even spot him. Of course all those \"warnings\" aren't always fake alarms, so player have to be prepared in every moment! It's also a great survival game, you have to looking for items like oil to your lamp, tinderboxes to set fire to torches for example and other items that will help you complete this adventure!\n\nSoundtrack is great, it fit in game perfectly. In my opinion soundtrack in every games HAVE to be good, especially in horror games. I recommend check some tracks on YouTube.\n\nGame has also an option that allow you put some custom stories created by fans (There are a lot of cool maps to play). Also remember that some of the custom stories were making \"for fun\" and they aren't scary at all, but still worth to play a couple of them, no doubht about it. So if you completed the main game and You still looking for some cool, scary/fun stories to play, go ahead.\n\nI should also say about the physics in this game. You can pickup almost every items you spot, chairs, boxes, bags etc. You can compare that to Half-Life 2, but in Amnesia this one is more advanced.\n\nYou should complete this game in 6-8 hours on the first playthrough in my opinion. I recommend looking for as many items as you can spot, since the inventory is unlimited. There is also one small addon called Amnesia: Justine, it's very short (1 hour) but in my opinion still worth to complete.\n\nI rate this game 8/10 (Very Good), not 9/10 because it's scripted game and you won't have same fun playing this game second time since you'll remember a lot of things.\n\nI didn't say about everything, story in game and other things, but this is my first \"big\" review.

The biggest difference between the two series is that Amnesia does include more of the classic horror induced moments of being chased and hunted.  Not that Penumbra didn't have a bit of that, but I'd say in Amnesia, there were specific moments designed to inject some action.\n\nOverall however, the game is paced similarly.  I could wander about, sip some coffee, read my notes and mementos and take in my surroundings.  \nThis may sound casual but what Amnesia succeeds in doing is creating a sense of dread.  Brennenburg Castle is a miserable place and rarely do you find yourself feeling too comfortable. When an enemy does discover you and then gives chase, it is probably one of the more scary moments I've experienced in a game.  The music, the blurriness of your view, the sound of the monster chasing you...not to mention, when you do finally get behind a closed door and find a hiding spot, you then get to watch as the door is violently brought down into pieces. All you can do is hope you're not spotted as you stare at the wall (there is a \"sanity\" element if you're new to these games).  IRL, I am guilty of some audible \"gasping\" during these moments.  During one particular chase I couldn't find an adequate path to get away from my pursuer and let out a frightened yelp that I am ashamed to even admit. Though, it is important to mention that I allowed the game to get under my skin purely because it was better that way.  I could have played it and completely steeled myself from letting it get to me (e.g. left the lights on, lowered the sound, casually approached the objectives), but what's fun about that?  For me, nothing.\n\nAs far as the story is concerned, I felt compelled to move forward to find the next clue.  I could feel a bit of excitement (or perhaps it's better described as relief) every time I saw a new note to read or completed a puzzle.  Naturally I won't reveal any spoilers just in case someone does read this review. \n\nI must emphasize that this is not a game full of jump scares and over the top gore.  With that being said, there are some very disturbing scenes that you come across.  I walk away from this game still thinking about some of what I experienced. Not just from the imagery but the story in general.

I now had the luxury to pay attention to the smallest details, submerge into it and finish the additional story - Justine and of course to explore every little corner and unlock the achievements (most people played the game when there were none, as these were added later). So now it's the second time I'm amazed by how good and well put together this game is.\n\nWe play as Daniel, a man who awakens in a huge castle in Brennenburg, Prussia (Germany) with no memory whatsoever. No wonder: as we find out from a note (which he wrote to himself), he intentionally drank a powerful potion that caused the amnesia he suffers from. The note also tells him that he must kill Alexander, the baron residing in the castle.\nAs we progress in the game, we gradually learn - along with Daniel - of his past and the reasons why he decided to forget everything about himself. And as if the menacing castle (which trembles from time to time) and the horrible monsters that roam its hallways weren't enough, there's a sinister entity stalking our hero which must be connected to the blood red goo that seems to appear all over the castle...\n\nThe lore built around the game is exemplary. Most of the mentioned characters we won't be able to meet in the game, yet the written texts do a great job introducing them successfuly to us. I've been a huge fan of this type of storytelling ever since System Shock 2. I also loved some small elements, such as how the game tried to correlate a key artifact with the globus cruciger held by medieval european kings.\n\nThe first thing we notice in the inventory screen is that Daniel has a sanity meter (a bit like in Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth), below his health. Unfortunately he is extremely easy to scare, so his sanity will evaporate from basically everything: looking at monsters, disturbing images, bones or hearing loud noises, even staying in the dark for too long. Yes, darkness, while it could be our ally it's also our enemy: if we hide from monsters for too long in the dark, we can get spooked. When this occurs we'll experience distorting visual effects, the screen blurs, Daniel starts to gnash his teeth and see imaginary things. This can apply to monsters as well at some locations and these imaginary monsters can actually hurt us. At extremely low sanity we can also slow down or even fall unconscious (which is strangely not as horrible as it may sound). Either way, low sanity is not a good thing and we should stay in the light when there are no monsters around. Our sanity can be replenished by solving puzzles or leaving main areas.\nThe second thing is that we are completely unarmed. I usually find this a cheap method of making a game scarier by depriving the player of weapons, but in Amnesia it seems somewhat justified and I actually enjoyed it: being defenseless fits well to the tone of the game.\n\nPuzzles represent a dominant part of the game. While there aren't many items we can collect (tinderboxes we can light candles with, oil we can use for our lamp and healing items) most of the puzzles make great use of the physics (much like in Tresspasser or Half-Life 2) the game's engine utilizes (also present in Frictional Games' previous games, the Penumbra series). The quest items are also not numerous but some of them can be used several times (prepare for the most bizzare uses ever) and the game will always tell us whether the item has any function in that exact location or not, so we can't screw up permanently (by filling up a bucket with oil instead of water for example). The physics also requires us to interact the doors, levers, valves and drawers manually, so instead of clicking on them, we have to pull or rotate them by moving our mouse. It's a really nice touch, but it can also be a pain during chase sequences when we have to do something within a given amount of time.\nThe other things we are going to collect are notes, letters and diaries, written either by Daniel, Alexander or any of the supporting characters of the game. They are necessary to understand the story, not to mention they usually contain the solution to some of the game's more complex puzzles and the key to experience the game's 4 different endings.\nA problem I could mention here is that some locations must be visited in order for the full experience (we can miss some notes when the portion of the castle becomes unreachable later).\n\nStrangely death is handled very liberally in the game. Usually when a monster kills us, we don't even have to reload, we'll just wake up in a random location in the area with all our stuff and progress preserved. In addition to that monsters are quite easy to avoid (especially once we learn their behaviours and patterns), most of them disappear completely if we lay low for a while (crouched). That being said, Amnesia requires little stealth, rather a quick and resolute jump behind an object, whenever we hear a monster approaching (they let out a pretty loud howl). Their arrival is scripted, so most of the time whenever we pick up an important quest related item, we can expect a monster to appear close by.\n\nThe game also contains an additional adventure (can be reached from the 'Settings Launcher') called Justine. It is related to the main story (both by some characters and the major theme - the Amnesia potion) and a bit more action-oriented. Interestingly, death here is final and once we fail we have to start over, since there's no save feature.\nThis one is quite short, but contains multiple endings as well and the story is almost as good as the one in the orginal, which I'm not going to spoil, but let's just say after having played Amnesia, we'll immediately know who Justine is and who's giving her instructions :)\n\nThe graphics is a bit dated, but still effective and by no means would I call it ugly. It has a certain distinctive look and can produce nice graphical effects, but these extra effects can cause minor slowdowns here and there. Make sure to turn off 'Imagetrail' in the options menu as it ruins the graphics, plus makes the game look choppy.\nThe dark, menacing, derelict castle makes a perfect location for a horror game and although it loses its charm on some occasion as we descend deep underground, it still features amazingly atmospheric and eerie environments. Some of the interiors are massive and I found myself looking into the seemingly bottomless abyss below several times. I loved the series of paintings and drawings adorning the walls, even though some of them were pretty disturbing (well, it's a horror game :)). There aren't many types of monsters in the game (one of them is invisible furthermore) but they are genuinely scary and I couldn't wish for better ones.\n\nThe sounds were equally good, but I did miss one thing: environmental audio. I loved the sounds of the monsters, the occasional tremblings in the castle but they could have been so much more with the proper use of surround sound.\n\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent is a huge step in the history of horror games. I could compare it to Alien: Isolation where I had to take breaks because of its depressive and dreadful nature. It's a classic now and shouldn't be missing from any horror fan's library.

But yet Amnesia did come around, and it redefined not just the horror genre itself, but indie gaming as a whole, I think. It showed that first-person gaming fit the horror experience perfectly (in my opinion, even demonstrating that first-person horror is the best possible kind of horror), and with the right narrative and thematic techniques (in both writing and gameplay), could create a rich and beautifully dark universe for the player to inhabit. \n\n... Assuming the player actually is bad enough to launch the game in the first place, that is. There's no two ways about it: Amnesia is one of the most terrifying games ever created, and that's as much a byproduct of its powerful and compellingly grim story as much as it is a byproduct of its grueling and sinister gameplay. At points you will be overwhelmingly afraid to continue playing, simply because every action and every moment you spend interacting with it, you realize more and more how powerless and incapable you are, and how little resources you really have. There is no combat in Amnesia - there is only survival, and it's as fleeting as it is difficult.\n\nIt's not the game for everyone, but I think that all gamers should at least try to experience it; even the first half of it, if not more. It may take you months to accomplish, but a full playthrough of Amnesia can be one of the most rewarding and exhilarating experiences in the history of gaming.", "timestamp_created": 1385904786, "timestamp_updated": 1385904786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 79, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819205999374389648", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39611523": {"recommendationid": "39611523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027150734", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442347463}, "language": "english", "review": "Free on Humblebundle!", "timestamp_created": 1516903849, "timestamp_updated": 1516903849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 618, "votes_funny": 56, "weighted_vote_score": "0.904112279415130615", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40671717": {"recommendationid": "40671717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027737122", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424919017}, "language": "english", "review": "It should be a crime that this game became free for roughly 4 times now in a matter of one year\n\nStill would recommend tho", "timestamp_created": 1520567110, "timestamp_updated": 1520567110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.797749757766723633", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12650090": {"recommendationid": "12650090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081337821", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427672719}, "language": "english", "review": "Get Amnesia they said, it will be fun they said.", "timestamp_created": 1414368032, "timestamp_updated": 1414368032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 823, "votes_funny": 667, "weighted_vote_score": "0.893415510654449463", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32711415": {"recommendationid": "32711415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198320546773", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505690198}, "language": "english", "review": "Amnesia is one of the scariest video games I have ever played. Its chilling atmosphere and dreadful threats make it stand out from its other horror counterparts. On top of that, the puzzles make a tense game all the more intense, but not in your traditional way.\n\nStory: The story in this game is extraordinarily compelling despite not being very original. Your name is Daniel, that's all you know as you pick yourself up from the castle floor. As you make your way through the abandoned corridors you come across a note addressed to you. It tells you of a man named Alexander who must be killed by you in order to redeem both your present self, and your past persona. You are also warned of a shadow that threatens to tear reality apart unless your able to stop it. As you journey throughout the castle you will discover sinister threats lurking throughout the shadows that threaten to prevent you from completing your quest of redemption. These include the omnipresent shadow that pursues your stolen power, the evil and twisted agents of Alexander, and the invisible, water dwelling Kaernks that have gotten loose from their confines. As you progress you will find notes and journals that give you insight into what your former peers and you were attempting to accomplish as well as why your previous self came to hate Alexander so much. By the journey's end you will learn of why you drank the Amnesia Potion, and what Alexander's true intentions were. Then you will be given the options to decide the fate of both Alexander's quest, and your own.\n\nOverall Score for Story: 10/10\n\nGameplay: The gameplay for Amnesia is what differentiates it from the rest of the genre. As you are told many a time, you are unable to defend yourself from the monsters, so your only options are to avoid detection, and if that doesn't work, run like Bill Cosby is behind you. This experience is made unique by the game's sanity meter. The higher the meter, the easier it is to survive as you'll be harder to detect and enemies will glow blue which will help you to evade them. Having low sanity will cause you to be less stealthy, have a harder time seeing enemies, have distorted vision/hearing, and once it reaches rock bottom, you will crumple to the floor for several seconds in a recovery phase that will attract all surrounding enemies to your area, you can get back up, but only if your not killed. The sanity meter is lowered by looking directly at enemies, witnessing unsettling/supernatural events, or staying in the dark too long. It can be recovered however by progressing through levels and completing puzzles. This makes the game an intense experience as your forced to make key decisions at each encounter with an enemy. In addition to this there are a plethora of physics based puzzles that you must endure to progress.\n\nOverall Score for Gameplay: 10/10\n\nCharacters: The characters though few in many are memorable and interesting figures. They all have interesting and engaging character arcs that compliment the theme of the game very well. This includes the protagonist, who despite being silent is a deep and tragic figure, an impressive feat considering the average silent player character.\n\nOverall Score for Characters: 9/10\n\nGraphics: The graphics in this game are quite sharp looking at high settings, but at medium or lower begin to look extremely dated (medium settings look like something out of 2007). Its not too difficult to run at high settings with a steady frame rate so you shouldn't have too much trouble unless your on a DS Lite. The monsters are textured poorly but that's not a big deal, especially since your not supposed to look at them. The lighting is alright, but its no Doom 3. It seems that the lights affect a circular area but don't cast convincing dynamic shadows. Overall, the game looks okay, but isn't phenomenal. \n\nOverall Score for Graphics: 7/10\n\nSoundtrack: The soundtrack is minimal in this game but shows up in all the right places. It truly conveys the intended feeling the game wants you to feel whether it be safe, hunted, or confused. \n\nOverall Score for Soundtrack: 8/10\n\nSound: The sound design is really good in Amnesia. Footsteps feel full and heavy, monsters make frightening growls, and the physics objects bang and clash and scrape when you interact with them.\n\nOverall Score for Sound: 9/10\n\nThis game is great and a very memorable experience. I believe that anyone who likes the horror genre should give this one a try as it will fulfill everything your looking for in a horror game. Please just don't be one of the people who plays it just for scares and ignores the story (you'd be doing yourself a great disservice).

At least I'd like to put it that way. The developers have always, in my eyes, succeeded in bringing a true form of horror. That, being defenseless and not knowing what you're about to plunge yourself into.\n\nThe Game offers an eerie atmosphere in a Prussian Castle where the main character Daniel awakes after he drank a mixture that'll make him forget, hence the Title. You will however soon find out why Daniel chose to forget, and let me tell you, you would've chosen to forget too. Without any means to defend yourself you're being thrown into a dark, creepy castle full of Horrors that may (or may not) lie around every corner. Was that noise you just heard your mind playing tricks on you? Or was it something far more dangerous. I wan't to be honest, I could barely play the game for longer than an hour without suffering panic attacks, intense amount of fear and dread and lots and lots of foul language.\n\nif you're into Horror Games, don't let this GEM slip by. Many people said this game set the bar for Horror Games to a new high, rightly so. If you don't mind 1st Person and being defenseless, plunge into the minds of Daniel as he explores the Castle to find his true identity, what led him there and why he gave himself the order to murder someone deep down in the castle.\n\nThere are also a lot of Custom Stories that can be downloaded and played at the developers forums.\n\n5/5, by any means.

It's not that I'm indecisive it's just, I can't find the proper words to ever describe this game. You couldn't possibly understand what this game means to me. You might like it and the horror genre would say it's a great game but to me it's more. This game single handedly restored my faith in horror games and got me playing them again. After Resident Evil 5/6 and after Silent Hill Homecoming and Downpour I stopped. Stopped playing, stopped reading up on, stopped caring about horror games. Resident Evil I saw coming but Silent Hill too? This mass appeal mindless action bullsh*t needs to stop. Survival horror was the genre that got me into gaming and then I saw the genre just up and leave us fans for more sales from the Call of Duty players. Action is where it's at? As the head developer for Resi 6 said \"Survival Horror games are no longer popular, we needed a new direction and new ideas\" well guess what... Amnesia proved Survival Horror still has plenty of new ideas to bring to the genre and proved that the genre is not dead. \n \nAmnesia is art.... it's artwork crafted by brilliant minds. Look past all the fun scary chases and the jumpscares, just look at the game. A first person game that doesn't have weapons? Yeah imagine that. You hide and run from monsters, much like people would do in real life. But if you break down the level design, the choice of imagery, the methodically detailed environments. You will see true beauty within. If I may quote some negative reviews here \"water monster wasn't all that great of an enemy, he doesn't even have a character design. It's lazy....\" yes they had limited resources however this isn't lazy design choices. The fact that you cannot see the water monster is more terrifying than any other creature in the game. It plays off your imagination, the fear of the unknown. Your mind subconsciously filled the blank with your worst fear which gave this monster so much memorability. The water monster is one of the most memorable moments, everyone talks about it and that's the reason. \n \nAfter such a horrifying experience with the water monster, what happens? You walk into a well light room with a fountain that supplies the calming sound of running water, a hole in the ceiling with light seeping through (one of the first times you see the light of day in this game), beautiful music plays softly in the background and the room has a tint of blue in the air. This is no randomly designed room, no this is a reward. This is saying \"Hey you made it through that horrible experience, breathe relax a bit. You deserve it\" and that is something I haven't seen before. No stupid achievement unlocked, no legendary loot, no high score and no misspelled CONGRADURATIONS. In a game that plays on your fear and emotions, they reward with such. They made you crap your pants, now they're making you feel relaxed. And that means more than any achievement. \n \nThe story is rich and it plays along with the tension in the game. The enemies aren't scary on the level of a jumpscare but rather the fear of being chased. Jumpscares are cheap thrills, true fear is much harder to achieve in a gamer and much more satisfying for the gamer. They accomplish this in many ways. Never knowing what danger lurks beyond the glow of your lamp, the dark abyss continuously hunts you down, the monsters are not just some scary looking monsters for the sake of \"boo look at me I'm scary\" they're people you tortured and sacrificed for your own safety against the darkness, their disfigured bodies are representations of the guilt you bare in the deepest parts of your conscious despite suffering Amnesia you still feel it, led astray by someone you thought you could trust, no escape or easy way out the only path is down and it's bathed in darkness as you descend slowly into your past with each step you lost sanity, walls are shaking, the crackling sound of your own mind is louder than your beating heart as you're chased by a horrifying disfigured creature you created, the sound of screeching can be heard when they're getting closer letting you know how close you are to death. \n \nOh... jeez I... I can go on and on about this game. Hell I want too... but if this gets any longer it will be considered a novel. The best thing I can say about this game? Play it... please. I beg you if you're a fan of horror games, if you like being scared, if you like a good story or immersion or hell if you just want to play a damn good game; play this game! \n \nThis is without a doubt my favorite game of all time. The favorite game, not one of. That's hard to say, but it's true. I never game 10 out of 10. I always made fun of other reviewers who did, saying no game is perfect. 10 out of 10 is saying it's the masterpiece of all gaming and cannot be improved in any way, shape or form. However, I've seen my mistake. You don't give it a 10 based on some score that means nothing to anyone else other than you. You're giving it a 10 based on the experience the game gave you.

Amnesia: TDD is an amazing horror game packed with interesting and challenging puzzles, a very eerie atmosphere and dangerous monsters.[/b]\n\n\nIngame you have a health and a sanity level, hiding in the darkness decreases your sanity but makes it harder for monsters to spot you, staying near light or lighting your lantern stops your sanity from decreasing but allows monsters to easily spot you, solving puzzles and progressing increases your sanity if you have lost any, but looking at monsters decreases it as well. Once you have gone completely insane you break down on the floor and can't move for a few seconds, this makes it incredibly easy for monsters to get you if there are any around, after getting up again your sanity will be restored to the best possible level. Being hit by a monster or environmental hazard decreases your health which can be refilled with Laudanum, a chemical you can rarely find ingame. Besides Laudanum there are multiple other things you can find, those things include tinderboxes, which can be used to light light sources, notes, which can be read, oil, which can be used to refill your lantern, and various other, mostly puzzle related items. The monsters wander around the levels searching for you, they are attracted by light and sounds, so you should be quiet and avoid lights around them. You'll know when they're around though thanks of the grotesque noises they make. If they spot you they start chasing you, so you better hide quickly because they're faster than you as well! There's also another type of monster that behaves completely different than the others, which you'll have to find for yourself if you do decide to play the game! \n\nThe gameplay mechanics above result in the game being hard but balanced, you can hide in the dark but if you stay there for too long you'll have to suffer the consequences, using your lantern gives you a mobile but limited light source which can be turned off if necessary, but staying near a light source lit by a tinderbox or a natural light source will not consume your precious oil but could put you in a more dangerous situation. While there are a lot of parts where these horrifying creatures hunt you, sadly there are also a lot of boring parts where not all that much is happening, it would've probably been better if the different creatures appeared more often, especially during puzzles, although that could just be me.\n\nAnother thing that this game is quite popular for is its amazing physics engine which allows you to interact with almost any object by either taking and throwing it around (small objects), by pushing/pulling it (larger objects) or by opening/closing it (doors and drawers). This results in many precious items being hidden behind a few barrels or inside a drawer and is required in many puzzles. Additionally throwing a box at a monster can give you precious seconds in an intense chase as it stuns the monster for a short period of time.\n\nThe story is very deep and interesting and I never skipped a note thinking it would not be worth my time reading the note. The notes generally explain the story very well and pretty much everything is explained throughout the game. I won't go into much detail describing the story itself as that would ruin the fun in exploring it yourself, the store page already provides the necessary story elements. There are three different endings.\n\nAtmosphere is probably one of the strongest elements of this game, not only will the soundscape give you goosebumps but the tension you feel when being chased by a monster or the fear you feel when a monster is walking by is unmet by any other game I've played.\n\nThe puzzles are always challenging and interesting and solving them feels satisfying. Especially good are the puzzles you have to solve while monsters are around, these puzzles, besides the atmosphere, are one of the greatest elements in Amnesia. While the puzzles are definitely not easy they are never unsolvable and never break the immersion, you'll always have an idea of what you have to do and if not then a little looking around will give you the hint you need.\n\nWhile the graphics are definitely dated they are still quite acceptable and especially the light effects look very nice. The monsters look disgusting and really give you the creeps.\n\nThe price of 19.99\u20ac totally justifies the average completion time of 10 hours, especially considering the general quality of the game in addition to the free \"Justine\" DLC and the \"Remember\" story collection (both of which I will take a look at later) packed with the game. Besides that, due to the freely available in-house HPL 2 engine which the game uses, players are able to create and distribute custom storys which others can download and play, these are officially supported and can be loaded ingame, this allows for infinite horror!\n\n\n[b]In conclusion, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a masterpiece in game design and a must-have for every horror fan, with amazing puzzles and gameplay, a deep story, an incredible atmosphere, nightmare-inducing monsters and the ability to create custom stories which makes the fun endless![/b]\n\n\n\n[h1]Justine DLC[/h1] (spoilers ahead)\n\n[b]In the free Justine DLC you take on the role of Justine Florbelle, a young woman who drank an amnesia mixture and has to pass tests in her own \"Cabinet of Perturbation\", guided by her own voice she has to survive against three imprisoned suitors and has the chance to either kill or save three other prisoners.[/b]\n\nThe DLC is quite different from the main game, it is much more linear and it doesn't have the same atmosphere as the main game, nonetheless it is still interesting and the fact that you can't save the game at all is a nice twist, even though it is still not that hard to beat considering the average playtime of 30 minutes. While the atmosphere is not that good the last chase scene with the third suitor Malo de Vigny (who wants to eat your flesh btw) is definitely the most intense moment in the whole game which will definitely have you drenched in sweat at the end!\n\nWhile the monsters in the main game only emit animalistic noises the three suitors can speak and despite them having the same model they all have a different personality. The three prisoners have their own personality as well as a story which Justine explains after you've decided their fate.\n\n[b]Even though the DLC is not as good as the main game it is still an interesting experience and worth playing especially considering it's completely free![/b]\n\n\n\n[h1]Remember[/h1]\n\nRemember is a story collection containing 5 stories that explain the backstory of Amnesia a bit more, they are nicely illustrated and while it is probably not interesting to a majority of players it is definitely a nice read if you are interested in the story of the game.

A true classic and the benchmark by which all other horror games are judged. The main selling point of this game is that in other games you would be scared s**tless by what you see, but in Amnesia it is what you can't see that terrifies you more than what you can see.\n\nIt keeps you at the edge of madness and terror whilst at the same time keeps you there without ever pushing you to the point where it because mundane.\n\n[h1]The Story:[/h1]\nThe story is actually very engaging, with the protagonist being an Englishman named Daniels suffering from amnesia, you find yourself in an old dark castle set deep in the Prussian woods [b](In case anyone doesn't know, Prussia was a German state before the Country was renamed to the German Empire.)[/b]\n\nWhat Daniels is doing in the castle is up to you to find out, you are searching for answers regarding why you have an Amnesia. But those answers are unlikely to bring you joy.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n\u25cf There is never a time where you won't be afraid\n\u25cf Very engaging story\n\u25cf You have to look after your health and your mental health\n\u25cf You have to keep an eye on your supplies - eg: Lantern oil\n\u25cf Very well designed and terrifying game areas/levels - eg: Prison, Sewers, Wine Cellar \n\u25cf Soundtrack & visuals\n\u25cf Achievements\n\u25cf Very immersive\n\u25cf Very atmospheric\n\u25cf The darkness will be your best friend and greatest enemy\n\u25cf Community created stories [b](More playtime.)[/b]\n\u25cf Price range [b](Sometimes it goes on sale for \u00a32.99, too much of a good deal to pass up.)[/b]\n\u25cf Puzzles [b](You will stumble upon them whilst traveling the castle.)[/b]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n\u25cf Lantern oil [b](The Lantern runs out of oil pretty fast if you don't conserve it. This wasn't a problem for me but it can be for new players.)[/b]\n\n\u25cf Death [b](When you die, well. You just die and return to the last saved checkpoint. I wish there was some kind of a cutscene or a better death transition.)[/b]\n\n\u25cf Monster disappearance [b](Monsters disappear after a while. Which massively takes away from the challenge factor in my opinion.)[/b]\n\n\u25cf A small number of bugs and glitches\n\n\u25cf Sound stuttering [b](It happens occasionally. But then again I do acknowledge that this game is pretty old, it did come out in 2010 after all.)[/b]\n\n\u25cf No Steam Trading Cards\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent is a true classic old school horror game where it doesn't rely on jump scares to scare the player, but relies on the soundtrack, levels, and the darkness. No game I have ever played has used darkness so effectively. It is both your best friend and greatest enemy at the same time. It will hide you from the terrors, but it will expose you to the insanity brewing in your own mind. Everything about this game works well to produce a true feeling of fear.\n\nIf you like horror games this is a must-have. And if you have the balls to play it at night with the headphones and curtains closed. Then you are in for a rough ride. \n\n[h1]Overall rating 9/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1511704296, "timestamp_updated": 1549472054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.743209898471832275", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40166601": {"recommendationid": "40166601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013655101", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1527456472}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't believe that I finished this game...Mom I'm a big boy now!!", "timestamp_created": 1518893397, "timestamp_updated": 1518893397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 38, "weighted_vote_score": "0.711706459522247314", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42403807": {"recommendationid": "42403807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092862237", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1527709618}, "language": "english", "review": "Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a survival horror video game by Frictional Games, known before Amnesia from their \"Penumbra\" Trylogy.\n\nIn Amnesia we play as Daniel, who wakes up in the dark and empty halls of the Prussian Brennenburg Castle with amnesia. He finds out a note written to himself which informs him that he has deliberately erased his own memory and is being hunted by a \"shadow\", and instructs himself to descend into the Inner Sanctum of the castle in order to find and kill its baron, Alexander.\n\nIf you played Penumbra, you know how gameplay looks in Amnesia as it is really similar. \nThe game retains the physical object interaction from it, allowing for physical-based puzzles and interactions like door opening. \nOne of the difference is sanity meter. \nIf you will stay in darkness for too long, you will witness weird events along the way, or you will stare at monsters for too long, Daniel's sanity will get reduced which will cause hallucinations and drawing the attention of monsters, and I think you don't really want that. \nTo restore sanity you need to stay near the light, and if there are none close to you, you can use tinderboxes to light candles, or you can deploy your oil-burning lantern.\nBut watch out, as you have limited amount of tinderboxes, which you need to get by simply exploring the levels, as for lantern you will also find some oil refills here and there, so to survive you need to do little exploring or to pass levels dark which is really, really harder than it looks.\nYou can also collect notes that really help in puzzle solving, and pages from Daniel's diary to get that extra lore.\nAs for monsters, you need to simply hide and wait for a right timing, as they have their own scripted roads and behaviours, if they will spot you somehow, just flee and hide again, hopefully without being torn to pieces by them. \nAnd monsters can destroy doors in their path and kick obstacles out of the way, so you never know when you are safe or not.\n\nWhat I like is that game dosen't include jumpscares. \nThere is a really, really small amount of them as game prefers to scare you with dark levels and by \"unsettelling events\". And by monsters themself. I really enjoyed that, as games often use cheap and cliched jumpscares to scare you.\nAlso it uses \"hubs\", which are safe and well-lighted places that are put in between dark themed levels so you can have a little rest and be less prepared for scary part.\nIt works, and here I agree with comment made by developer. \nPutting dark places and jumpscares only in game makes a player slowly to get used to that, making the game less scary.\nHere game does a great job of using hubs as kinda \"reset\" place, where you think you are safe, just to go into a dark trap in a next level.\nSound design, mostly composed by Mikko Tarmia, works perfectly with a theme of a game.\nIs it when hiding from a monster, exploring a map, or hearing monsters lurking around, it just fits in a game as it should.\n\nGame includes also a developer commentary, that shares some things from sound desing stuff to some add-on lore. \nIt is short and interesting, I recommend turning that option in game if you are interested!\nAlso it has a \"Custom Story\" mode, which allows you to play Amnesia mods made by community! Pretty interesting and original, as not many games has that option.\n\nOverall, Amnesia does a great job of being a adventure horror game with puzzle elements, great storyline, and scary monsters that lurk in shadows of a dark, prussian castle to kill you and stop you.\nBUT hopefully you don't think game is as scary as pictured by Youtubers, as this game got really, really popular by them mostly.\n8/10. \n\nIf you enjoyed that review, check out my curator page! \nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/31947302/\n", "timestamp_created": 1527770075, "timestamp_updated": 1527770075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.772522926330566406", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15097450": {"recommendationid": "15097450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015064808", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518444841}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like colorful and friendly games, this is for you!

However I'll try my best to review it as I would have back after my first playthrough.\n\nDifficulty Normal :4/10\nHard Mode: 6/10\n\nThere are no seriously difficult puzzles, there are some that can be solved multiple ways but they're all very straight forward. Some of the difficulty comes in managing your light. No light? Daniel slowly goes insane. Oil isn't uncommon, but the lamp drains it at a surprising rate.\n\nHard mode makes stuff annoying as hell, but I wouldn't say its really that much more difficult, Just makes it much more tedious. It's even more sitting in a corner than the normal game already is. Know where all the tinderbox spawns are and know where all the monster triggers are and you'll be fine.\n\nSound: 9/10\nThe way the game utilizes the \"natural\" castle noises or Daniels own gasps or teeth grinding really get into your head.\nJust the sound of wind blowing a door open can be hair raisingly frightening.\n\nVisuals and atmosphere: 8/10\nThe HPL2 engine that the game runs on doesn't allow for supremely high quality textures. But what it can use, it uses beautifully. Some of the props look tacky, and the \"physics\" don't always look the best; but careful care is put into every room Daniel enters. I didn't know that room design could bring unease at the level that Amnesia was able to. Just load any map in the level editor. The detail is astounding.\n\n[spoiler] Monsters: 9/10 [/spoiler]\n[spoiler] The grunts are TERRIFYING, even more so if you have the unpleasant misfortune of coming face to face with one.\nThat groan still sends chills up my spine. \nI found brutes to be not as frightening as grunts, both in model and the noises they make. But they're also so just so well designed. (Obligatory fuck you to the brute at the end of sewers.)\nThe water monster. The fucking water monster. It's not even a model, it's just a splash animation. But god DAMN was it horrifying. Oh you thought it was over? Keep running bitch [/spoiler]\n\n\nStory: 8/10\nThe backstory to the game is told mostly though diary entries that Daniel finds throughout the castle. The rest is told through Daniels flashbacks as he moves through the castle as well as more infrequent notes left by other castle denizens. The story is very lovecraftian; things beyond human comprehension, evils of the universe bringing man to the point of insanity. To get the COMPLETE story you have to read the short stories frictional has put out (found on the games launcher, the button \"Remember\").\nIt certainly didn't pan out the way I was thinking it would.\n\n\nOver-all spook factor. 9/10\nThe devs know what scares people. \nOne of two games that I was afraid to play in broad daylight. (I know I'm a baby) The other being Frictionals Penumbra Black Plague. Two of the most terrifying areas for me [spoiler] The Choir and Storage [/spoiler] took several sessions of playing to complete.

Have that sense of adreline when you are faced by something that can easily overpower you if caught?\n\nI would recommend amensia to anyone who enjoys a good horror game that is geared towards making you scream.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\n+Great Atmosphere (Great music, Graphics, and theme)\n+Great Pacing\n+Great Mechanics \n+Good Puzzles \n\n[h1]Fear Itself[/h1]\n\nIt is so well focused on all the elements on horror that you are unable to even fight back at the enemy. Forever doomed to listen and feel terror down your spine as you try to find cover or some place to take shelter from the sight of the enemy. \n\nAnother feature of this game to note is the idea of looking at your enemy makes you panic is quite genius. This allows for more realistic scare tactics such as quick glimpses of the enemy, and constantly trying to avoid its attention. \n\n[h1]Issues[/h1]\n\nWhile Amnesia is a good horror game there are some glaring faults with the overall game that could makes  the game lose the effectiveness of its horror. Continue reading at your own risk.\n\n[h1]Predictability[/h1]\n\nThe issue stems from the predictability of the monsters spawning right after puzzles. Once you realize you're safe doing a puzzle you lose the tension and prepare even beforehand for the enemy to spawns by memorizing some closet locations. When a player sees the pattern the threat itself ceases to be horrifying. \n\n[h1]Confrontation[/h1]\n\nThe other issue is simply when players choose to confront enemies. Seeing the enemy also takes away to the mystery of what they look like and actually brings down the scare factor. Once they figure out how to trick the AI in more ways or simply stop being so afraid. The game design choices have been good to avoid this happening except for the fact that randomized monsters poof once you confront/die to them and you are pretty much safe till next puzzle.\n\n[h1]Flashbacks[/h1]\n\nFlashbacks do not restructure the place to how it would look like before the guy had amnesia. It would be a better visual comparison to see how much the place suffered structurally as a result. \n\n[h1]Taking Control away[/h1]\n\nTaking control away from the player to demonstrate how the character feels at the moment I feel was a mistake. They do this a few times in the game instead of letting the player himself/herself react.

Amnesia: the Dark Descent is that game you shouldn\u2019t be focused on playing the game to win; you should be focused on being submerged into this big, dark, and petrifying world. Amnesia\u2019s scares are ones that last, making your hands shake and evermore aware of your surroundings. These long lasting scares, however, are evenly put out with the unique puzzles in the game. Nothing ever feels better when you solve an elaborate puzzle, and move onward to the next. You cannot fight your enemies; you should either run like hell, or hide. From solving puzzles, dodging monsters, and keeping an eye on your sanity. Every chamber just takes you ever deeper into the abyss of what\u2019s called Amnesia: The Dark Descent. \n\nIs the Main Story too scary? Or are you bored of it?

The other part of the lore is revealed in \"flashbacks\" or \"memories\" triggered by doing certain action, or just reaching certain place.\n\nThe level desing is beautiful, a dark castle, some of it's rooms are really big, where you could feel really small, others will be quite small, like long corridors, or a small room, it truly is a magnificent place for a horror game. Details like paintings, warrior armors, desing of doors, of rooms, statues, even animal cadavers, it's really beatiful and creppy sometimes, it makes you dive into the world, and feel like you're there. The light effects are good, how torches light up a place, or how a little ray of sun comes through the wooden ceilings, the effects of fire, even blue fire, everything looks good, and they make it even better with shadows. Graphics makes an important point on the player innmersion, and makes you feel the way they should feel.\n\nGame sound, one of the strongest points of the game for me, combined with the graphic desing, it makes you feel scared, the music on the levels is amazing, they use several sounds to make you unconfortable several times, like hearing steps above you, combining it with a cloud of dust that cames from there, little and weird growls that you hear sometimes, and even Daniel himself can say several things randomly in several points of the game, which most of times will scare the f*** out of you. The most disturbing music I've ever heard is the chase music for Amnesia, this being when a Gatherer (this is how monsters are called) sees you and starts chasing you, it makes you completely hysterical, even when you have experienced it several times, it still makes the same effect, you do NOT want to get chased by them. Also the music used when a Gatherer is around is really creppy, you'll know some monster is around when you hear it, and it'll dissapear once the monster's gone. Sounds of the monsters themselves are good, as they always have their mouths completely open, they sometimes speak, saying things like: \"Where is him?\", \"There you are\" in a deformed way, they growl all the time, even when they spawn, you'll hear a very specific sound, a distant but powerfull growl.\n\nSomething really important to understand it's the sanity meter, this feature takes an important part of the game (it's in the inventory page), it could make your life easier, or harder, as the meter depletes (it's a brain, that gets damaged, and has colors), you'll start experiencing different events, and could mess up with your controls, making it hard to move, to escape. It can deplete in several ways, such as seeing a disturbing moment, like a door brutally opening, hearing some sounds, being too much on the darkness, or just by looking at the Gatherers, the lower it is, the more things could happen, being the worst falling to the ground on the wrong moment, like when a Gatherer just spawned near you. You can experience hallucinations, such as a monster appearing and running towards you, but dissapearing before he can touch you, or seeing bugs in places, hearing sounds, or Daniel just freaking out, making sounds with his teeth, heavy breathing, feeling dizzy. It can be replenished by making progress in game, or staying for a long time in the light.\n\nThe tactics in this game are simple, you CANNOT fight any of the Gatherers, you can simply run and hide, there\u00b4s no way to defend yourself from them. Monsters run faster than you, so you can't win a race against them, it is best if they don't see you at all, that way you can crouch and move to the darkness, or hide in a closet, behind some door or behind a wall, thing is, if they see you getting to a room and closing the door, or getting inside a closet, they'll go and hit it until you die or they break it. They can hear the noises you make, if you drop a box, or hit a wall while carrying it, they'll come there to investigate and look around, same if you jump, they'll do a \"WROARARAR?\" and go to the sound location, if they can't find you after a time, they'll leave, so be sure to stay hidden until the searching music stops.\n\nThe game itself doesn't have very much items to grab as other games, there's quest objects, tinderboxes to light up torches or candles, health potions, and there's sanity potions (I never found one in the main story), they're popular on custom stories.\nSome quest objects are reusable, and you'll need them in several places, until they aren't needed anymore.\n\nMonsters: in this game the monsters are creppy and scary, there isn't a big quantity of them, due to the 4 or 5 monsters included in this game are really good, scary and they work perfectly as they are, there's no need for more. They are heavily disfigured, big claws, ugly faces and bodies, metal pieces attached to their limbs, more letal as the game advance, faster than you, bigger than you, they're plain scary, you do not want to be close to one of them, as you learn the story behind them, it makes it worse.\n\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent has 4 possible endings, it's in you discovering them all, they all have different points and give different perspectives in what you think would be the best, so it's cool to visit them all.\n\nPROS: \n- Beatiful graphics.\n- Magnificent music/sounds. \n- Excelent level desing.\n- Amazing story.\n- Has Custom Stories made by players.\n- Interesting puzzles, not super hard, not easy.\n- Has everything that a horror game should have, and gives the feeling a horror game should give.\n- Controls are good.\n- It never gets boring.\n\nCONS:\n- Some of the graphic options could give fps drops.\n- If you're fast enough, you could finish it in 4 hours.\n- If you're someone how doesn't like to read, then you'll have a rough time.\n\nIn the end, Amnesia it's a game you HAVE to play, it has way too many things that makes it an awesome game, that you need to enjoy in every aspect, absorb it all. And it's a game that you'll wanna revisit from time to time, and it still will give you the same feeling as the first time you play it.\n\nOverall result: 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1516913037, "timestamp_updated": 1516913110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736047446727752686", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28536254": {"recommendationid": "28536254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009039291", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482446155}, "language": "english", "review": "+heard funny noise\n+hid in cupboard\n+left cupboard heard another funny noise\n+hid back in cupboard\n+got up from computer, backed away and hid in cupboard.\n\n\ni can watch these horror films on TV and not bat an eyelid, but this...this is really spooky", "timestamp_created": 1482438454, "timestamp_updated": 1482438454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 98, "weighted_vote_score": "0.762173831462860107", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39626053": {"recommendationid": "39626053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306167447", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517028839}, "language": "english", "review": "Installed the game.\nPlay the game.\nAlmost sh*t my pant.\nQuit the game.\nUninstalled the game.\n\nGood job developers.", "timestamp_created": 1516965109, "timestamp_updated": 1516965198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 41, "weighted_vote_score": "0.74937206506729126", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45633908": {"recommendationid": "45633908", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970739339", "num_games_owned": 472, "num_reviews": 390, "playtime_forever": 568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1541116361}, "language": "english", "review": "I put off playing Amnesia for a long time. It's the first and one of the only games I've ever played where you are totally defenseless against the enemies, with your only option being to run and hide. This did not sound appealing to me on paper. But I have only ever heard good things about the game and when I finally decide to sit down and play through it, I was mostly pleased. I can't say I enjoyed having limited supplies, but it does sort of lend a sense of urgency to the procedings.\n\nAmnesia is the story of a man named Daniel who awakens in Castle Brennenberg with no memory, finding a note from his past self that he must find and kill the master of this castle, Alexander. But getting there is no easy task. The castle is alive with shambling horrors, as well as some phantom presence that is pursuing Daniel, manifesting as disgusting meat moss over parts of the castle. Using only his wits, an oil lantern and scant supplies, he must make his way to Alexander's inner sanctum. Not only must enemies be avoided and health managed, but Daniel's sanity is also in question and looking upon Alexander's minions or even standing in the dark for too long damages such, while solving puzzles and progressing through the game restores it.\n\nAesthetically, Amnesia is quite compelling. What it lacks in raw graphical prowess it makes up for in excellent sound design, interesting narrative and oppressive atmosphere. The game cleverly accounts for the semi-goofy appearance of its enemies by making it of paramount importance NOT to look at them. There is a vague sense of \"otherness\" throughout the experience that makes it feel something that's more then standard gothic horror, but not explicity so, at least not early on. While I preferred both the second Amnesia game and it's spiritual successor SOMA, something about The Dark Descent's cold cobblestones, flickering torches and creaky doors interested me even before I had played the game itself.", "timestamp_created": 1541389017, "timestamp_updated": 1541389017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.731940805912017822", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18089001": {"recommendationid": "18089001", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094651178", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443088358}, "language": "english", "review": "I was chased by an invisible water monster. I threw a bible at it and the creature bled.\n\n10/10 - Would throw another bible to induce bleeding because IF IT BLEEDS, WE CAN KILL IT!\n\n\nJokes aside, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is an atmospheric horror game. Like the advice recommended upon starting the game up for the first time, you do not play to win. Rather, you play to survive. There is no difficulty setting and there are no quicksaves whatsoever, just the usual autosaves and the ability to save once to exit the game. This allows players to not worry too much on when to save and focus more on survival.\n\nThe sounds in Amnesia have been worked very well. Upon playing in the dark with headphones, the immersive abilities of the game kick in. The constant echos in the stone castles or creaks on aged wooden planks remind players they are in an ancient castle where help is so far away. Literally, the only way to be comfortable for a moment is in a properly confined room with a lit candle...or the closet. \n\nWhy the closet? Well, there are enemies in this game...and they are legitimately scary. Hardly anything competes against their hideous apperance and merciless intentions to seek and kill you. I dare you to stare face-to-face at a humanoid being who has reptile eyes and its lower jaw has been detached from its face. Oh and, it hates being stared at because if it sees you, it will try to slash you. \n\nThere is almost no way to run if such an encounter occurs. Just throw something at it to stun and then run like hell. Or, if you are lucky, hide in the closet and beg for mercy. When the monster attacks you in the closet, you will know sh!t hit the fan so hard, it's everywhere and out of control. Why are there no weapons in the game? Having even a knife would ruin the scare factor and the game would not be so scary anymore. \n\nWhile avoidng enemies, exploration is the key to find essential but quite rare items. Light (and typically the closet) is your best friend but the lantern consumes so much oil and jars of it is so rare, nothing can make you happier if you find one. There are tinderboxes to light up torches and candles but beware. They cannot be put out unlike the lantern and you really do not want to be in a well lit room when a monster comes in growling. \n\nOf course, it would seem like common sense to not use the lantern and lit up dark areas. Upon doing so, your sanity can be drained faster. At the lowest level, it then works against you and cannot be repaired or reverted when trying to stare at a lit up candle, only nullified. At high insanity, hallucinations take over and can appear more often than the real threats and your movement and literally stop. This leaves you helpless...especially when a monster is nearby and you need to run or hide. As such, making progress, such as finding an quest related item, is the only thing to help the poor soul of Daniel.\n\nWho is Daniel? He's an unlucky chap who was pulled into this mess. Avoiding too many spoilers, he decided to drag himself into an ancient castle and after terrible events, Daniel must pull himself together and kill the person mostly responsible for his predicament. He can't leave the cursed castle until this is done. As such, to learn about his past which he erased from his memory, there are notes scattered about and flashbacks that depict the horror before the game starts. In a way, this breaks the fourth wall because reading them helps to soothe the player's paranoia in the real world upon playing the game for so long!\n\nEventually, the main storyline/campaign gets boring when one memorizes where the monsters spawn and such. Thus, the game introduced the wonderful feature to install custom stories. Some of them, which, are even more terrifying than the base game. You've been warned.\n\nThe only complaint I had was some of the gameplay features. Closing and opening a door, for example, takes some getting used to. Instead of pressing \"e\" to interact, one needs to press \"use\" and then use the mouse to open it at a desirable speed. Thankfully, there is some time to practice that at the very beginning of the game.\n\nIn conclusion, these traits are what many games and movies lack, especially Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. Thus, I highly recommend Amnesia: The Dark Descent who want a refreshing horror experience.", "timestamp_created": 1442607796, "timestamp_updated": 1442735687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.716568648815155029", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19085136": {"recommendationid": "19085136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055676738", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1525336549}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][quote]The only thing we have to fear is Fear itself. -Franklin D. Roosevelt[/quote]\n***As a small disclaimer toward this review, though I do not have many recorded hours through Steam for this game, I typically had played it offline and have progressed much further than my online hours would anticipate. Also, I would like to give thanks to Demo_187 and Brother Tasty for proofreading this for me.\n\nHorror game fanatics of many generations know this title to be one of the most influential in the genre. [i]Amnesia: The Dark Descent [/i]-commonly referred to as, simply, [i]Amnesia[/i]-is a first-person psychological thriller set in an aged castle-like structure. The player ventures through the massive compound without memory of previous events with the hope of departing said area, never to return. This title is certainly becoming dated, but frets revealing this with its unique exploration approach to gameplay, as well as the ominous theme that persists.[/h1]\n\nHere are a few points of interest in this engaging title:\n\nAtmosphere - [i]Amnesia[/i], unlike other recent horror titles, utilizes much more sophisticated means of psychological disturbances in comparison to the usual mirage demonstrated by jump-scares. As expected, [i]Amnesia: The Dark Descent[/i] is quite dark, to the point that extended exposure to dimly lit rooms drains Daniel\u2019s-the protagonist-sanity; this causes the player to expend light sources such as the portable lantern and tinderboxes to illuminate the area. Violent screams and ominous groaning aide in this title\u2019s atmosphere, as these auricle displays may or may not contribute to the actual game experience in ways other than overall feel; whether or not such sounds are relevant can only be determined through play. There are few disruptive sequenced events since each offers context to the game\u2019s illusive story, and Daniel has created a few \u201cNote to Self\u2019s\u201d for the player to find that only add to the unsettling unknown.\n\nStory - As stated, this title\u2019s opening entails the protagonist awakening in a seemingly uninhabited structure with no prior memory of interactions within. From here the player must quest through the house to uncover its secrets. This title-fittingly-is very psychological, maddening even, as the tale is surfaced only by exploring the massive home to horror. Just the right amount of information is revealed through playable scripted events and texts, but the full story remains outside of the player\u2019s reach unless portions of this illusion are pieced together; even so, some questions remain unanswered to service some ambiguity. So as to not reveal anything of major importance, I will halt this segment with these final words: search well.\n\nTrivial Gameplay - Combat-apart from flailing chairs and other loose objects at unmentionable daemons-is nonexistent. [i]Amnesia[/i] advocates primarily as a puzzle mystery game in which player must resolve encounters with cunning rather than physical prowess. Challenges are crafted well enough to accommodate [i]Dungeons & Dragons [/i] campaigns while retaining a similar theme to a remainder of the game. As for the controls, players maneuver with the standard W, A, S, and D key layout while also adding giving simple commands for lifting objects, illuminating wall- and table-mounted torches, accessing in-game menus, and equipping items such as the lantern; it is a simple system, but this sort of title requires no such complexity in having to remember an obscene amount of button combinations.\n\nTL:DR - Challenges range in difficulty from moderate to complex, with an intense atmosphere throughout. [i]Amnesia[/i] is best presented in a dark room while playing alone and utilizing a decent sound system. Uncovering journals, I realized how much I did not know, but also that this most frightening revelations could possibly be recurrent or relevant to the current protagonist\u2019s stride; this game truly knows how to disturb the player. I highly recommend this title to anyone that enjoys explorative mystery, puzzle, or horror titles from the first-person perspective. In my honest opinion, [i]Amnesia: The Dark Descent[/i] is a legend in the horror genre, so I would not pass on this title. Thanks for reading.\n\nDo you feel this review helped in any way?

It's not the prettiest game, but it looks very good eitherway. The monsters are very scary, and although I'm pretty much not scared of them now with the time I've put in, it still invokes fear and stress into me when I'm getting chased down by one. \n\nThe controls are perfect. Everything is mapped to buttons that make sense, and you have the option to rebind them all. It feels really well to move and do things, and it also has support for controllers.\n\nIt gives a generous amount of oil for the lantern and tinder for the candles for new players to have a pleasant experience going through it instead of being forced to sit in darkness like some horror games may do. Some may argue that would be a better thing to do, but I don't think so. And if you want that, play it's newest mode: Hard mode. \n\nThe monsters aren't THAT stupid. They have limited vision and whether they're able to see you or not will depend on if you're crouching, standing, moving, and whether or not you're holding your lantern out. Oh, and they've received a bit of an AI change in the newest update. They're officially slightly smarter than they've ever been. If you hold an object in front of you to block their hits, they simply won't hit you unless there's a clear opening. \n\nThe environment is completely interactable, you're allowed to pick up just about every object and throw it around, typically not being too heavy. You can pretty much pick up anything and toss it across the room, and there are breakable objects too such as bottles. Some objects you can't pick up but you can slide across the ground at a rather fast pace.\nFOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT PICK UP OR MESS WITH MATTRESSES THEY WILL STRETCH INFINITELY ACROSS THE ENTIRE MAP, TOUCH AND INTERACT WITH EVERYTHING, DESTROY ENTIRE WALLS AND DOORS AND DELETE ALL PICKUPS, AND DROP YOUR FRAMERATE TO 1 FRAME PER FEW MINUTES!!\n\nAlso you can create custom stories and import your own custom monsters and other models into the game to make your own world with voice acting and custom actions, and... CUSTOM STUFF. Or you can be like me and play every custom story two or maybe three times and get 700 hours on the game like I did.\n\n12/10 brilliant game.", "timestamp_created": 1542428517, "timestamp_updated": 1542429720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.726027429103851318", "comment_count": 44, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23391134": {"recommendationid": "23391134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045534868", "num_games_owned": 322, "num_reviews": 290, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443617095}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm scared that this is in my Library", "timestamp_created": 1465090092, "timestamp_updated": 1465090092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 99, "weighted_vote_score": "0.722249507904052734", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9736240": {"recommendationid": "9736240", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000920211", "num_games_owned": 322, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1374885438}, "language": "english", "review": "I strongly recommend this game.

Even though if you are avoiding scary games the immersive level of the presentation and amazing story will push you to keep on trough the psychological terrors that test your limits of how far you are willing to go to reach the end. Is there salvation, is there hope to get out of this nightmare? After all a big part of life is also about pushing through whatever is thrown at you and  rise to a new level of mind and strength that you couldn\u2019t reach without being tested and brought down thousands of times.\n\nIt will provoke thoughts and fear like no game before. For the atmosphere delivered by this game alone it would be a 10/10. If you are an immersive player like me, prepare for a ride that you can\u00b4t be prepared for. This level of quality horror is reached when Developers give their best to keep you guessing, immersed, curious about what is next without relying on sudden cheap tricks but doing it in style combined with lighting and Sounds that the true terror is what you imagine in the darkness and not what is actually there. But without spoiling anything what awaits in the darkness will be the kind you won\u2019t forget even long after you reached the end...\n\nThe technical part for the year of the game coming out is almost flawlessly done. New milestones were reached as far as sound goes and some one of a kind lighting effects that ties in to the presentation perfectly. Texture wise there could be more detail for my liking but that is a minor issue. The impression overall is what counts.  \n\nGameplay works well, is intuitive and again very immersive as you can move around things in the world to your liking and protection as well as peeking through doors like you would in real life. The tasks are challenging and rewarding on its own. There is good content and thought behind the story that connects the deeper becoming terror perfectly to the end. \n\nThe Soundtrack is almost as good as the game itself and tells a story on its own. \n\nWhat a long journey indeed it is so that many will not want daring to go through a second time. We want to protect us staying sane after all. It is about a long one time play through that you will always remember. I honour the team behind this game. It makes the top 5 Games of all-time list for me.

This review will be on the short side,because just about 15 thousand other people have said everything about this game,I am just here to put my two cents in,in fact,I feel obligated to write at least a few paragraphs,since this game deserves attention and respect,it is a staple and a benchmark by which all other horror games are judged. Basically it reformed and created a new sub-genre among horror games (and also because it took me 4 years to play it through,you can laugh now,yeah).\n\nNow,I'm not gonna spoil the story for you,but rest assured,it is engaging,mysterious,and interesting enough to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout your descend into darkness. The Lovecraftian elements are obvious here, mixed with some heavy influence from Poe (namely the setting itself,among others). \nYou are Daniel,an archeologist hailing from Britain,London. You wake up in the middle of the night in the castle of Brennenburg,located in East-Prussia. Hindered by amnesia (and probably some anxiety/paranoia),chased by an obscure shadow,your quest is to uncover a big mystery, what the hell happened to you,why are you in that old,decrepit place,and ultimately,to survive this living nightmare.\n\nIn the following section,we are going to take a look at the gameplay, the quality of the visuals/audio design,and the atmosphere.\n\nThe gameplay itself is simplistic yet your heart will probably skip a few beats. Seriously,this game is not for the faint of heart: you do not have means to defend yourself in any way,your only options are to either run,hide,or die. Your only friends are your trusty lantern and tinderboxes. You can utilize these in a way so that you won't go insane from total darkness surrounding the halls and passageways (at one point,torture chambers:p) of the castle. But beware,because if you stand in light,the monstrous creatures roaming the ch\u00e2teau will spot you with ease. There are the occasional puzzle segments,which are not too shabby,it gives you a little pause between discovering the place and shitting your pants.\n\nWith that out of the way,let's talk about the technical side of things: usually,when it comes to the graphics,I can be a little nitpicky,I'm not the \"anything goes\" type of guy,the visuals of a game can either immerse or put me off. Sometimes graphics don't matter,but we are talking about Amnesia,a game,in which the story is partially told and progressed with the medium of visuals. The guys do not disappoint,they did a stellar job in this department. I am not saying that the textures are Crysis/Shadow of Mordor/xy quality,but the way the game handles the lighting is nothing short of amazing.The atmosphere is heavy,crushing,morbid,other-worldly. It is mandatory to play this piece of art with the lights off,headphones on. \n\nYes,headphones. If you are playing any other way,you deserve to get dragged out to the street and beaten with a stupid stick. The sound,music and the ambience is amazing. Men,women,children screaming in agony,the growl of monsters,walls cracking,wood creaking,chains rattling,inexplicable noises coming from the end of the pitch black hallway. It is all here. Enough said.\n\n\nUltimately,Amnesia is not just a game. It is a dark,terrifying tale to be experienced. If you think,you have the guts,the perseverance,and the love for the genre itself,go right ahead,enter Brennenburg. Just do not forget your name and your lantern.", "timestamp_created": 1483886295, "timestamp_updated": 1542936523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685230016708374023", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18048451": {"recommendationid": "18048451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069579358", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1541191618}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the best horror game I've ever played. It is all about the atmosphere, ambience and the story. The way that Frictional Games keep pumping the tension during the game is just brilliant. The game is really immersive and if you get into it, you get into the story, get into the feeling of the main character, you'll be fully immersed and will feel all the horrors and fears that awaits behind every corner. That's what happened to me. Being adult, I have never been so frightened by any of the media content: either it is a movie or a game. But the Amnesia: The Dark Descent literally made me be afraid and really swet because of the tension.\n\nAnd there are no cheap techniques like so-called \"jump scares\" or anything I can remember of. All the scary feelings are invoked by the game's atmosphere built by amaizing art and graphics, brilliant ambient and sound effects, intriguing story and gameplay elements. It is your mind which, upon this all, will build inside the conclusions of the upcoming danger, which will may or may not happen. But you'll never know what is it this time: true danger or you're deluding yourself.\n\nWorth to mention that gameplay is built upon the idea, that you can't fight and directly resist your enemies with weapon. Therea are no weapond, no direct fights, no health bar, no danget indicators. And me personally like this idea and gameplay philosophy of Frictional Games, which they evolved from the great Penumbra series (in the first game you actually could fight, but avoiding it was the best option all the time). And alongside the dark atmosphere and unknown danger, when you don't know what is happening, who you may face with, and what it will cost you, the best idea that you would come up with in such situation in real life - is try to hide, or somehow avoid the danger, or run as fast as you can. You wouldn't stop to check out whether that butcher is gonna slaughter you or give you a hug.\n\nIf you liked what I have described, you should definitely grab and play this game (it's free right now)! There is much more! And I'm sure that upcoming SOMA will be another horror masterpiece.
