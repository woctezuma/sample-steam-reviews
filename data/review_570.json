Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing 12+ hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my 19th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 9-13. You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that saying \"nothing\" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s. \n\n2. Did i waste my youth?:\nSo this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts \"lets learn music\" or \"lets study\" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of \"improving\" wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that.\n\n3. time invested into dota2:\nEVERY dota player that has spent more than 1000 hours into this game has had that thought of \"oh man i shouldve learned something with this time.... i couldve been amazing now..\" at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota 2 is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure. It's kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for school again i realized how much \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you will be a top student if youd put 20 hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING.\n\nREWARDING: dota 2 is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665IGN REWARDING. you learn a new hero -> BAMM MMR. you start understanding how to farm -> M . M . R \n\nYOUR RANK GOES \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665IGN UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for about 10 minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this year(grades are OK(kinda good, not great)). \n\nReasoN I WROTE THIS: im downloading dota right now because my laptop is REALLY \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ed up adn deletes files something, so i needed something to do \n\n\n\nCONCLUSION: AMAZING GAME, EATS ALL YOUR TIME, YOU WILL HAVE FUN(if you are competetive) \nhope someone will ever read this lol hit me up if you wanna chat", "timestamp_created": 1550585441, "timestamp_updated": 1550585441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 64, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.813489437103271484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48901814": {"recommendationid": "48901814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087565006", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 327523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549202190}, "language": "english", "review": "Dota 2 is cancer.

It makes the skill even more difficult to understand with the added text and pros or semi-pros will definitely read the release notes.\n* The game has outgrown its Warcraft 3 custom map days and should start acting like it.

Each iteration of it reinvigorates the game and breathes new life into it. That being said, it has one of the worst communities in all of gaming. Almost everyone, from the pros to the scrubs, has an attitude problem. Furthermore, the game is highly addictive, even in unranked. Thus, if you pair this game with people who have no real source of joy or motivation in their life then you will end up with addicts. They love the high that this game brings, that feeling of flow, and start conflating it with actual joy. Thus, when they're denied that joy they become incredibly miserable and toxic.\n\nAll in all, I would say that if you are a well-adjusted individual then this game is a great game to play. You will have an amazing time playing, the mods are incredible, and you can even learn about creative game design and balancing from it. However, if you have emotional or mental health issues and are using this game as a digital escape then I would recommend that you stay away from it. You can very easily get hooked onto it and a long time will fly by before you're ever able to give it up. For many, this game will be far harder to quit than smoking will ever be.", "timestamp_created": 1551292479, "timestamp_updated": 1551292479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

There`s no chance for new players to learn and evolve their gameplay. Matchmaking is unbalanced and puts you up against seasoned players or smufs.

Finally, the Bee Movie script is here for all you fans of the Jerry Seinfeld animated movie. This puppy is a transcript that was painstakingly transcribed using the screenplay and/or viewings of the movie to get the dialogue. I know, I know, I still need to get the cast names in there and all that jazz, so if you have any corrections, feel free to drop me a line. At least you'll have some Bee Movie quotes (or even a monologue or two) to annoy your coworkers with in the meantime, right?\nAnd swing on back to Drew's Script-O-Rama afterwards -- because reading is good for your noodle. Better than Farmville, anyway.\nBee Movie Script\n  \n  \nAccording to all known laws\nof aviation,\n\n  \nthere is no way a bee\nshould be able to fly.\n\n  \nIts wings are too small to get\nits fat little body off the ground.\n\n  \nThe bee, of course, flies anyway\n\n  \nbecause bees don't care\nwhat humans think is impossible.\n\n  \nYellow, black.

Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing 12+ hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my 19th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact  this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 9-13. You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that  saying \"nothing\" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional assholes. \n\n2. Did i waste my youth?:\nSo this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt  that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta  be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts \"lets learn music\"  or \"lets study\" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of \"improving\" wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that.\n\n3. time invested into dota2:\nEVERY dota player that has spent more than 1000 hours into this game has had that thought of \"oh man i shouldve learned something  with this time.... i couldve been amazing now..\" at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota 2 is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure. It's kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for  school again i realized how much fucking time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you  will be a top student if youd put 20 hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING.\n\nREWARDING: dota 2 is FUCKIGN REWARDING. you learn a new hero -> BAMM MMR. you start  understanding how to farm -> M .  M . R \n\nYOUR RANK GOES FUCKIGN UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for about 10 minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this year(grades are OK(kinda good, not great)). \n\nReasoN I WROTE THIS: im downloading dota right now because my laptop is REALLY fucked up adn deletes files something, so i needed something to do \n\n\n\nCONCLUSION: AMAZING GAME, EATS ALL YOUR TIME, YOU WILL HAVE FUN(if you are competetive) \n[i]hope someone will ever read this lol hit me up if you wanna chat[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1523688970, "timestamp_updated": 1523688970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 463, "votes_funny": 66, "weighted_vote_score": "0.937905430793762207", "comment_count": 38, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10971834": {"recommendationid": "10971834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045533162", "num_games_owned": 417, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 234973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547808360}, "language": "english", "review": "DOTA 2, THE SEQUEL TO THE AWARD WINNING DOTA\n\nSTARRING:\nSven Staffani\nRiki Martin\n2 Puck\nStevie Nyx\nJackie Chen\nHrithik Roshan\nSlark Walberg\nJoaquin Phoenix\nJustin Timbersaw\nJustin Weaver\nClinkz Eastwood\nJohn Lina\nJim Carry\nTom Tanks\nNatalie Supportman\nSarah Jessica Ganker\ufeff\nAlch Pacino\nMatt Dagon\nChristian Bane\nEllen Pudge\nEd Harrass\nEddie Morphling\nMorgan Fiendman\nSnoop Lion\nBruce Lich\nBen Sladar\nRobert De Ny-ro\nLeonardo DisRuptio\nRussel Drowe\nDazzle Washington\nMick Jaggernaut\n50 Centaur\nMalcolm Axe\nOrlando Doom\nMirana Kerr\nZeus Willis\n\nDIRECTED BY:\nM.

Your home is abuzz with laughter, and the smell of fresh baked goods drifts up from downstairs. You race to the tree, and begin to open a beautiful present, adorned with festive colors and a wrapping scheme that is both dauntingly complex yet also simple in its execution. You turn to your mother, father, and two siblings and smile; for you know that your adventure into opening your gift is about to begin. You go to open your unwrapped box, and BWONG.. A horn bellows, deafening you. Out of the box pops a small, dwarf-like figure, wielding a multicultural bat festooned with Ecuadorian and Peruvian patterns, and of Russian construction. \"THANKS FOR STANDING STILL, GANKER,\" he shrieks, as he wallops young brother Timmy in the teeth. Your mother tuts and scolds him, for being out of position. The dwarf darts under the tree, looking for a hole in the wall to continue his pursuit of rat-DOTA. \"Gank him, cyka blyat!\" your father roars, as he sits on the couch lazily and watches. You crawl, desperate for your gift of victory over the rat, under the tree, and he continues to elude you. Suddenly, with a flourish, he produces a lighter, and proceeds to methodically burn down your house while muttering \"GG 2 EZ\", and your family sits in the living room muttering \"garbage team\" and \"reported\". Your family home burns down around them, and only you escape the engulfing flames, accompanied by the chortles of the dwarf. Downtrodden but not easily bested, you begin your walk down the street to your friend's house, in the hopes that by having Christmas at their house, you might be able to somehow catch the multicultural dwarf on the second try.\n\n10/10 Best fun and Peruvian simulator.", "timestamp_created": 1403584209, "timestamp_updated": 1403584209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 86, "votes_funny": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.845449924468994141", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12926792": {"recommendationid": "12926792", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971315634", "num_games_owned": 383, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 50088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516823486}, "language": "english", "review": "This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers.\n\nThen it taught me to hate them all.", "timestamp_created": 1415902112, "timestamp_updated": 1415902112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4090, "votes_funny": 6075, "weighted_vote_score": "0.923662841320037842", "comment_count": 97, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40209929": {"recommendationid": "40209929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368055410", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 103248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1591, "last_played": 1551851602}, "language": "english", "review": "Skipped classes thanks to Dota.\nLearned to gamble thanks to Dota.\nLearned to swear in 12 different languages thanks to Dota.\nBecame racist thanks to Dota.\n\nAll in all, Ruin your life simulator. 10/10 would recommend if you are trying to kill yourself. \n\nCancer can be cured,\nDota community can't be.", "timestamp_created": 1519002527, "timestamp_updated": 1519002527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 365, "votes_funny": 496, "weighted_vote_score": "0.907301902770996094", "comment_count": 22, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11121352": {"recommendationid": "11121352", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967245463", "num_games_owned": 616, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 78235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1533160711}, "language": "english", "review": "Imagine you're playing a game with a few friends and you're having fun.

Then, you start losing again, but this time it's not your fault; it's your teams fault. Always remember that NOTHING is EVER your fault. Your dumbass anti-mage was complaining that you were stealing his farm, but it's your farm dammit! Then pudge is getting butthurt about losing lane because he never had a flying courier, when the real reason he lost is because he didn't give you unit control when you are clearly a better pudge! Meanwhile the enemy team is getting fed because your teamates never backed you up when you blitzkrieged in 1v5, and they even have the nerve to question your methods! Then you notice that your dumbass anti-mage is in the jungle farming because \"he couldn't farm in lane.\" You know, however, that he is just a noob.\nEventually the enemy is pushing your tier 3s, and the game is obviously over. This is the time when you give up and sit in base. Ignore the fact that your team has won the last two teamfights and you are starting to catch up, it's better if you just quit now. While you're waiting in base, make sure that the enemy team knows that you are not at fault in your loss. Make sure you type in all-chat \"team noob\" followed up by \"report anti-mage.\" If they ask why you want them to report him, ignore them, if your team has the bodacity to try and defend themseves, repeatedly say phrases such as \"lol ur so bad\" and \"ur just mad cuz you cant play.\" You could also take the alternative route and say things like \"\u0438\u043c \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0439\" and \"\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f.\"\n\nYea, the game and communtiy can be a cyka sometimes, but it's also a super fun game that requires fast paced decision making as well as strategical analysis.

The source engine ensures you can run it on anything more powerful than a toaster, and have it look great too. Cosmetics look great, and fit perfectly, with some exceptions,(I'm looking at you Alpine Ursa) but many stay true to the heros artstyle. \n\nSound: 9.5/10\nAll heros have a multitude of voice lines,and some even respond to one another (e.g Tidehunters hatred for Kunnka). If you find the default anouncer not too flash, theres a huge variety of optional packs, from the smoth talking Narrator from bastion, to the harsh condescending tone of Pyrion Flax. \n\nGameplay: 10/10\nThe big one. Theres a reason DotA Allstars got so popular, not just from the incredible passsion from the community, or the dedication of IceFrog and co., but from the incredible gameplay that spawned one of gamings most popular genres.
