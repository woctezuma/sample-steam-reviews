I'm generally not a big fan of solo campaign FPS's so I got bored within the first hour when it initially came out.\n\nI finally got around to playing it on the channel and while I will say that I wasn't blown away by the story or the gameplay I must also say that very well could be because I played in in 2019 where most of the mind-shattering aspects of this game are standard in today's games. This came was revolutionary in 2004.\n\nI was surprised that many of the load times were fairly long, even on modern equipment (~5-20 seconds). I encountered quite a few bugs that were both hilarious and charming at times. The puzzles heavily rely on showcasing Source's physics engine and can get repetitive.\n\nI enjoyed the first 2/3's of the game but once you get to a certain part [spoiler](read: getting to The Citadel[/spoiler] it kind of feels like they just tried to cram a bunch of \"extra gameplay\" time by doing the typical \"run to point a, solve a puzzle, survive a wave of enemies, run to point b, solve a puzzle, survive another wave, repeat\".

To be honest here, I don't like Half Life 1 at all, thought it was dumb, boring and at times very confusing.\n\nHalf Life 2 however.... is completely the same. The story is way too convoluted for what it should. A lot of cheap enemies still roam the levels, just waiting to pound at your full health and armor. One good thing about Half Life 2 is that there a fewer headcrabs.\n\nMost of my time in Half Life 2 was walking around trying to find my way just like in the first one. Sometimes I just don't know where to go, but then I remember that is Half Life so wherever I need to be it'll in that seemingly dead-end because there's never any backtracking in this game. The way out is always forward.\n\nThe gravity gun is fun, but that ends there. The physics are a bit weird at times.

Still, [i]Half-Life 2[/i] is no \"ordinary\" game. Even before it's release, it was the most talked about, and surely most anticipated game up till then. Back in 2004, Valve was still primarily a game-developer, Steam had only just been launched in order to streamline the updating-process for the Valve-games (quite an original and ground-breaking idea since back in those day patching one's game could easily turn into a hazardous adventure). Immediately after its release, [i]Half-Life 2[/i] was loaded with critical praise, and almost instantly rose to the top of all lists defining the best games ever. And even today, after ten years, it still tops a lot of those lists.\n\nI played it for the first time only five years ago, messing around with the original [i]Half-Life[/i] up till then. Five years ago, the game struck me as still very good-looking and a blast to play, even being five years old. Quite recently I picked it up again, to be honest in the first place to get some of the achievements I had missed during my first play-through (I only got really interested in the Steam achievements this year). To my surprise, the game immediately got back under my skin, so I decided to give it another play-through, and I enjoyed it immensely, hence this review.\n\nOf course the [b]Source Engine[/b] shows its age: up-close textures get quite blurry, but the wider vistas are still amazingly \"alife\", and the colours and general atmosphere are still exciting. The physics engine - a novelty back then - now surely feels outdated, even crappy, but playing around with the famous \"gravity gun\" makes more than up for this, and surely has its funny moments. But in every other respect, this game is a classic and a masterpiece in the true sense of the word. The story is so convincingly told, that I felt myself beeing \"Doctor Freeman\" again, already during the first chapter (which introduces the gameworld in a very ingenious way which has not been surpassed ever since). The level-design is simply awesome. Compared to modern-day shooters, the interface and the amount of information about the surroundings you get as a player, are minimal. There is no minimap, there are no waypoints, there is no compass, there is no large-scale map. And still, I never ever got lost, thanks to the downright genial way the levels are designed. Still, the amount of freedom you get is great: there are tons of hidden places, byways, or larger spaces to explore, besides the more traditional corridors, but they always manage to lead you in a logical way. This game offers the classic examples on how levels can be optimally designed.\n\nSound, too, is amazing: there is not much in-game music, but when it appears (mostly in the action-packed scenes), it really delivers to the full. Sounds from the guns, NPC's and ambient sounds are extremely convincing. But what still shines most of all is the actual gameplay and the way this games is \"paced\". Sneaky, almost stealth-like scenes alternate with extremely violent action-moments, in a very, very clever way, only to be alternated with puzzles and other moments where thinking is required. The choice of the right gun at the right time is essential, and very rewarding. There is a lot of interaction with other characters, but never up till the point where this gets tedious. And best of all: there are countless moments of surprise, when the story takes a turn for the unexpected. So, yes, this is still a classic, and yes, it's still up there among the best games ever (although I personally would grant it a top-five place or so, the top-three spots taken by more recent \"classics\").\n\nFor my scorings, I give them as I conceived the game during my actual playthrough, so not taking into account it's a ten year old game.\n\nGameplay: 27/30 (there are some frustrating puzzles and some weird moments with the gravity-gun but everything else is sheer genius)\nGrahics: 15/20 (the outer vistas are great, the rest is showing its age)\nSound: 9/10\nLongelivety: 8/10 (no multiplayer, but the game has tons of singleplayer gameplay)\nSteam integration: 10/10 (it comes with trading cards and 33 achievements, most of which really add something to game, if only to explore different ways to achieve things - the way achievements should work imo)\nTechnical: 9/10 (runs very smoothly and I got no crashes, but sometimes hangs for a couple of seconds on loading screens)\nPersonal appreciation: 10/10\n\nOverall: 88/100", "timestamp_created": 1409252840, "timestamp_updated": 1421320830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 477, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.917577683925628662", "comment_count": 26, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36249870": {"recommendationid": "36249870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271938896", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1538787976}, "language": "english", "review": "GTA: San Andreas\nHalf Life 2\n\nBoth 2004 games\n\n\nhow the hell half life 2 lookin modern to this day ill never know.", "timestamp_created": 1509736524, "timestamp_updated": 1509736524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 209, "votes_funny": 49, "weighted_vote_score": "0.908375740051269531", "comment_count": 42, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18719180": {"recommendationid": "18719180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043609914", "num_games_owned": 2360, "num_reviews": 398, "playtime_forever": 593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445958213}, "language": "english", "review": "This one of the best first person shooter games I've ever played, plain and simple.\n\nHalf Life 2 begins 20 years after the original Half Life. As Gordon Freeman awakens from stasis he finds himself on a train heading to City 17 which is overrun by the combine. You find yourself as the leader of the resistance and you must take down the Combine. \n\nHalf Life 2 is at this point one of the best received games and I'm sure pretty much everyone has played it. If not well what the hell are you doing reading this review ? You need to go buy this game straight away and play it right now.\n\nThe game is a simple first person shooter, but it does plenty things different than the regular first person shooters. You have a health bar and you have to do platforming to solve some of the puzzles.  Not to mention the source engine physics are absolutely insane. \n\nFor a game that came out back in 2004 it still looks amazing. Now while it does have so low res textures it's still looks breath taking, like in the final chapters.\n\nThe game for the most part is pretty easy. I played through the game without a problem, even though some segments were tough due to the fast movement you have to pull off to avoid gunfire. Not to mention the Strider battles are incredibly intense and quite difficult.\n\nThe game took me 10 hours to finish. I felt this was the perfect amount of time for the price I paid for it and this was worth every single penny.\n\nApart from the single playthrough there's not much replay value. The only reason to replay it twice is to look for the G-Man Easter eggs. \n\nIn the end Half Life 2 is a fantastic game. It's a must own for everyone who is a gamer. This game is a piece of history and without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life.\n\nI experienced zero problems while playing the game. I ran the game on ultra settings 60 FPS the entire time of playing. This game runs really well and should run on pretty much all systems.\n\nFinal Rating:\n9.5/10 -  A Must own and must play\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_created": 1445987985, "timestamp_updated": 1454102072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 375, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.932829141616821289", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12597607": {"recommendationid": "12597607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083936748", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413765344}, "language": "english", "review": "Play and understand why we need Half-Life 3.", "timestamp_created": 1413913815, "timestamp_updated": 1413913815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1497, "votes_funny": 667, "weighted_vote_score": "0.922682881355285645", "comment_count": 26, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27249122": {"recommendationid": "27249122", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986993988", "num_games_owned": 1083, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548591885}, "language": "english", "review": "Even in 40 years, I will still love this game ...", "timestamp_created": 1480008271, "timestamp_updated": 1480008271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 82, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.880002975463867188", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31460012": {"recommendationid": "31460012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079729119", "num_games_owned": 3461, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493570768}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow, this thing is almost 13 years old now.

Starting with a physics engine, I can easily say that never have I ever played something on this level.

Other than that, you can interact with almost any object in-game and use it in some way.\n\n[h1]Level Design[/h1]\nAll of the levels are designed with great attention to detail. You can never get bored exploring all of the corners looking for supplies and ammo. It is not just \"run and gun\" as most FPS games are today. Some of the levels require you to use a boat, buggy, crane etc. There are also small physics puzzles you can stumble upon that require to be solved in order to proceed. All of this just shows how powerful this game engine is. It's a shame Valve doesn't make more games like this.\n\n[h1]All in all, it's a classic.

Doubt it).\nHowever, i noticed the two best games i got on Steam that i havent reviewed yet happen to be the 2 best FPS's of all time, so here's the first review of the two:\n\nHalf Life 2 is the role-model for all FPS games ever made:\nIt \"only\" has a singleplayer campaign, but its so well done it doesnt need anything else.\n- Graphics-wise, know this: it's a 2004 game, i played it on 2010 and not once did i feel they were outdated (then again, im not one of those who care a lot about technical aspects)\n- Sounds... this is not a type of game where this aspect is very relevant, so i cant recall anything about it really\n- The Story, even though its not the most original or filled with amazing plot twists, it is still compelling and engaging, making you care about its great characters and what happens next\n- Gameplay, there's where this game excels. From the now-classic 'no cutscenes / always in control', to the incredible variety of scenarios in each level, each with its own tone and pace, and jam-packed with (this is my favourite aspect of the game...) UNFORGETTABLE MOMENTS - seriously, i can recall more than 10 scenes that i'll probably never forget about this game. \nThe weapons are also great, in quantity, diversity and in the fun-factor. The enemies too are varied enough and provide a reasonable challenge (though an higher difficulty level would be great).\n- The length of the game is also one of the best / longest i've seen in an FPS, though it provides little replay value once finished.\n\nConclusion: Must-play for any gamer out there, to experience a landmark in videogame history, proving again that Valve knows how to make Greatness.

I've dreaded reviewing Valve games since Steam reviews first started, because it's a developer I've placed on a very high pedestal, so objectivity is not on the menu. Half-Life 2 is something you've already played long ago or something you sought out just recently, because you wanted more from an FPS. \n\nFor the past 7 years or so, I've been on a quest to watch movies that left a permanent mark in film history. I sought out those films for that reason alone. If you're on a similar quest with games, you're bound to meet Half-Life 2 on your path. It's a special breed of FPS, an experience so refined that to this day it stands above the rest in the genre, which is why it's my nominee for The \"Test of Time\" Award in the first Steam Awards.\n\nIf you are completely new to Half-Life, the most envious position to be in, all things considered, then start with the first game. Half-Life, Half-Life: Source or Black Mesa, take your pick. Half-Life 2: Update is another thing to experience.

I'm going to say right now to those who haven't played Half-Life 2 to do so immediately, as it is an incredible game that to me has triumphed over the tests of time and remains high on the list of video games that can never be bested.\nHalf-Life 2 is just about perfect in every regard: from it's carefully forged story to the perfected pacing, from unforgettable characters to a steady challenge curve. The entirety of Half-Life 2 is a journey leading the player full circle in their quest to liberate humanity from their omnipresent multidimensional conquerers, the Combine. \nBut if the game wasn't already grand enough, Valve gives the player ultimate control over their physics engine with the highly beloved Gravity Gun (you can call it the Zero-Point Energy Manipulator, if you really want to), a weapon that has never been equaled in any game since. The Gravity Gun allows you to pick up objects from the world, like barrels, sawblades, crates and anything you can move and use them as protection against enemy fire or throw them at your foes in a satisfying method. This is even encouraged by the developers, for the level immediately after you recieve the Gravity Gun you are placed in a zombie-infested town with limited ammo and plenty of sharp, explosive or otherwise deadly-when-hurled-at-100kph objects. In other words: A playground for your new best friend. \nSo if you're a recent gamer looking for a timeless classic or a veteran tired of all the two-weapon inventory crap in modern games, I sincerely and whole-heartedly recommend Half-Life 2 for an experience that has never been topped.", "timestamp_created": 1395402675, "timestamp_updated": 1395402675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 126, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.863281548023223877", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39376262": {"recommendationid": "39376262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194662083", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515265715}, "language": "english", "review": "===[ \u2764 Audience: ]=== \n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Everyone\n\u2611 Casual players\n\u2610 Pro players\n\n===[ \u263c Graphics: ]=== \n\u2610 Potato\n\u2610 Really bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 OK\n\u2611 Good \n\u2610 Beautiful \n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\n===[ $ Price/quality: ]=== \n\u2611 Full price\n\u2610 Wait for sale\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Refund it if you can\n\u2610 Don't do it\n\n===[ \u2623 Requirments: ]=== \n\u2610 90' PC\n\u2611 Minimum\n\u2610 Medium \n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 High end \n\u2610 NASA computer\n\n===[ \u263c Difficulty: ]=== \n\u2610 You just need 2 arms \n\u2610 Ez\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master \n\u2610 Hard (first few hours)\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n\n===[ \u06de Game time/length ]=== \n\u2610 Really short ( 0 - 2 hours)\n\u2610 Short ( 2 - 8 hours)\n\u2611 Few hours ( 8 - 12 hours)\n\u2610 Long ( 12+ hours)\n\u2610 Endless\n\n===[ \u266c Story] === \n\u2610 It doesn't have\n\u2610 Still better than Twilight\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611  Fantastic\n\n===[ \u00a7 Bugs ]=== \n\u2610 Game itself is one big BUG\n\u2610 Bugs destroying the game\n\u2610 Lot of bugs\n\u2610 Few Bugs\n\u2611 You can use them for speedrun\n\u2610 Nothing\n\n===[ \u2726 Others: ]=== \nMultiplayer: No\nSingleplayer: Yes", "timestamp_created": 1516054917, "timestamp_updated": 1516054917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 235, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.888054013252258301", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32220265": {"recommendationid": "32220265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060277415", "num_games_owned": 2819, "num_reviews": 630, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496755717}, "language": "english", "review": "Half-Life 2 is a game that I recommend because:\n- it worth the money totally\n- it is atmospheric\n- the graphics are pretty good\n- it is a legend\n- it has controller support\n- it has a great soundtrack\n- it has a very good storyline\n- it is horror\n- it has a good concept\n- it has trading cards\n\nEnjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1496756957, "timestamp_updated": 1496756958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 820, "votes_funny": 38, "weighted_vote_score": "0.899100542068481445", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7680918": {"recommendationid": "7680918", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967347790", "num_games_owned": 511, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 2754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474998613}, "language": "english", "review": "Half-Life 2 takes a minimilist approach to story development, but delivers a rich, atmospheric, and engaging world that sucks you right in.

(Combine occupation, Gordon's story... etc) That's why you should raelly browse the wiki for more infos. \nMany things remind of portal (the musics) (the citadel, that huuuuge building reminds a lot of portal 2) and the 2 games are even supposed to take place at the same time. (There are some allusions to Black mesa in portal and some allusions of Aperture in HL).\nHowever the game can be a little buggy, and the achievements are bugged as usual in Source games... \n\n\n\nExcellent jeu solo, surtout grace a son super scenar et son cot\u00e9 immersif. C'est meme surement le meilleur FPS solo auquel j'ai jou\u00e9 apres portal.\n\nComme d'hab dans les jeux Valve, pas de cin\u00e9matiques, on vit tout \u00e0 travers les yeux de Gordon, et c'est ce qui rend le jeu si immersif.\nIl y a de bons passages ou il faut bien chercher pour une sortie, une entr\u00e9e... etc.\nL'univers du jeu est vraiment enorme meme si le jeu n'explique que peu de choses dessus (l'occupation Combine, l'histoire de Gordon...etc ) c'est pourquoi ca vaut vraiment le coup de jeter un oeil au wiki. \nBeacoup de choses rappelent Portal (la musique, l'ambiance sur les bords) (le citadelle, qui rappele portal 2) et les 2 jeux se passent meme en meme temps, dans le meme univers (il y a des  allusions \u00e0 Black Mesa dans Portal et des allusions \u00e0 Aperture dans HL)\nSeul d\u00e9fauts le jeu bug un peu et les succ\u00e9s eux buggent aussi pas mal, comme d'habitude dans les jeux source. \n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1389814372, "timestamp_updated": 1389814372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 89, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.810688138008117676", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47557443": {"recommendationid": "47557443", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010898367", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 8568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548931696}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2500\u2584\u2584\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2588\u2588\u2593\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2580\u2559\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2559\u2580\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2580\u2500\u2588\u2588\u2588\u258c\n\u2588\u2559\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2551\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2580\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2580\u2580\u2510\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2514\u2514\u2580\u2588\u2588\u258c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u250c\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2584\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2553\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2584\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2590\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2557\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2500\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2590\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2518\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u250c\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2580\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2593\u2588\u2588\u2518\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2552\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2518\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2514\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2584\u2500\u2500\u2584\u2588\u2588\u2580\n\u2584\u2500\u2500\u2559\u2559\u2559\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2559\u2580\u255c\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2584\u2588\u2588\u2580\nI want to believe", "timestamp_created": 1544918111, "timestamp_updated": 1544918111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 133, "votes_funny": 104, "weighted_vote_score": "0.867985129356384277", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30370643": {"recommendationid": "30370643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106936862", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483231917}, "language": "english", "review": "13 Years it has been long enough gaben", "timestamp_created": 1488884766, "timestamp_updated": 1488884766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 77, "votes_funny": 38, "weighted_vote_score": "0.837182700634002686", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37397551": {"recommendationid": "37397551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048964530", "num_games_owned": 1064, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1381790122}, "language": "english", "review": "A game that deserves a sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1511550077, "timestamp_updated": 1511550077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.809353828430175781", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32431727": {"recommendationid": "32431727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004715173", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 4913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497156259}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic.\n\nYou should have played this by now.\n\nJust do it.

See Conclusion[/h1]\n\n[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]\nHalf-Life 2 is a first-person shooter game developed and published by Valve Software (Corporation) and is a sequel to the extremely popular and revolutionary 1998 game [i]Half-Life[/i]. Half-Life 2 was originally released back in 2004 and was then boasting the newly developed, highly flexible and powerful Source Engine, it then became an instant classic by making good use of new technology, excellent storytelling, gameplay mechanics and an unrivaled online experience. Alongside its predecessor, both games left a lasting impression, particularly on the FPS genre, as an industry standard for future FPS games to come.\n\n[h1]PLOT (No Spoilers):[/h1]\nHalf-Life 2 puts the player once more behind the thick-framed bulletproof glasses of Gordon Freeman, an MIT Graduate of Theoretical Physics with an uncanny ability to wield military hardware and the person indirectly responsible for opening a portal to an alien world and exposing Earth to an invasion that is to be known as the 'Black Mesa Incident'. Half-Life 2 is set 20 years after the events of Half-Life 1 and the world is now under the full control of the 'Combine', an interdimensional empire that is currently harvesting the natural resources of Earth including the human race which is now close to extinction.\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n+ Graphics and artstyle that looks just as good as it is now (2015), as it was eleven years ago (2004).\n+ Excellent sequel with an excellent story that expands the Half-Life Universe\n+ Excellent memorable supporting characters such as Alyx Vance\n+ Great sound quality, facial animation, and voice acting adds to the immersive experience\n+ Excellent enemy AI\n+ Great level and environment designs but...(see CON #1)\n+ Fun gunplay and gameplay mechanics\n+ Good selection of weapons and equipment with very creative special abilities (Gravity Gun)\n+ Atmospheric with excellent use of lighting, sound effects and environment design\n+ Challenging difficulties\n+ Expanded levels that give some room for exploration, but doesn't destroy the narrative storytelling\n+ Lengthy game time\n+ Very affordable price (though I highly recommend the Half-Life Complete pack)\n+ Multiplayer is still active as far as I can tell\n+ Tons of available mods that expand player experience\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n- Driving section may be a little too long but it does offer a few 'stops' where the player can stretch his leg muscles and trigger finger.\n- The Squad Support AI is down right suicidal with no command to tell them to stay in place for more than 15 seconds before they follow you again. [i](This is annoying specially if you're trying to keep them alive against particularly deadly opponents such as Striders)[/i]\n- Rag-doll physics engine can be unrealistically (albeit hilariously) glitchy\n- No Steam Workshop Support for the multitude of MODS that are available.\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\nMuch like its predecessor, Half-Life 2 is a [b][i]MASTERPIECE[/i][/b] of a game and is a MUST BUY and MUST OWN for any fan of the first person genre because how else can you describe a game that is almost 11 years old, yet, can still retain all the fun and excitement of a recently released title.\n\n[h1]WORTH IT?:[/h1]\nIf you decide to purchase and try this game, I do recommend you purchase [url=http://store.steampowered.com/sub/715/]Half-Life: Complete[/url] so you may also avail of the two Episodes that was subsequently released.\n\n[h1]FINAL NOTES:[/h1]\nHalf-Life 2's use of the amazing Source engine reflects on the fact that this game's graphics, despite showing some age, still manages not only to look good, but also to look authentic and atmospheric with its excellent use of sound and music that makes the environment feel alive. Graphics aside, the gameplay has survived for even after a decade and has still not lost its charm. The enemy AI provides an imposing challenge while gunplay and the creative weapons creates one of the most fun and immersive experience you can get on a first-person shooter. Storywise, the Half-Life universe can be considered as one of the most beautifully crafted worlds in gaming history. Half-Life 2 fully emphasizes this point with its amazing and memorable supporting characters that can establish a connection with the player on an emotional level. To recap, Half-Life 2 is the game that once again redefined how modern first-person shooters will be made in the future and remains as the benchmark for good single player FPS gaming experience.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n[h1]Like my Reviews?

You have brought us grief and jubilation beyond measure. With you beside us, a talisman of victory, the day of freedom draws nigh.\n\nYour bright face obscures your darker mask. We call you sib, although your mind and meaning are a mystery to us. Far distant eyes look out through yours. Something secret steers us both. We shall not name it. We have endured these chafing bonds for eons, yet a single moment of further servitude seems intolerable! How often have we slipped our yoke, only to find it choking us again. Let this war end in either total victory or our extinction. No further compromise shall we allow. We take our stand beside you, here, upon this miserable rock.\n\nThe way ahead is dark for the moment. What seems to you a sacrifice is merely, to us, an oscillation. We do not fear the interval of darkness. We are a tapestry woven of Vortessence. It is the same for you if only you would see it. How many are there in you? Whose hopes and dreams do you encompass? Could you but see the eyes inside your own, the minds in your mind, you would see how much we share.\n\n We are you, Freeman.

The game follows an arc similar to most forms of media, especially film media, with the player seeing highs, lows, and an excellent climax as through the eyes of Gordon Freeman.\n\nAs stated above, this game remains an amazing title and experience, both in gameplay and in plot, with a great deal of effort directed at character development and map and AI design. You could be told this was released a week ago and would believe it, as both its graphics and physics engine remain top-notch and put to shame those of most other shooters, both at the time and now.\n\nThe game follows M.I.T. graduate and Black Mesa Research Associate Scientist Gordon Freeman, who, after being placed on a train heading to City 17, faces off against the oppressive Combine Empire that controls the city and the planet. With the help of the resistance movement and old and new friends alike, Gordon fights the Combine as they launch continued assaults against him, viewing his return to be a serious if not the single greatest threat to their dominion.\n\nThe game is an outstanding example of storytelling, with the arc being one of my favorite in any game released - period. Without a word coming from Freeman's lips, the universe and history of City 17 and Earth in general is greatly explained, and through events the player grows to despise the Combine Empire, which in turn grants extra reward to the player when they succeed in trading blows with it.\n\nWith an excellent soundtrack composed by Kelly Bailey, the game's means to convey emotion increase, action scenes become more epic, horror scenes become more terrifying, and emotional scenes become more deep and impactful. The game uses its soundtrack in a masterful way, reintroducing old tunes and beats from Half-Life 1, and introducing a new soundtrack that perfectly fits the situation.\n\nThe game is also masterful at finding a blend of pleasing and challenging a player; Most concepts are introduced by some form of training to help open the player up to them, rather than forcing the player to learn skills on the spot, though the game makes sure not to help the player too much to keep the challenge going.\n\nIf you haven't bought this game yet on Steam, I strongly suggest you do so. It's an excellent title that has everything a good game should have: Interesting Plot, well-written characters, interesting and fun mechanics, a fitting and enjoyable soundtrack, good map design, excellent world-building, and so on. It stands 12 years since its release in most majestic fashion with the means to challenge most AAA titles shat out to the market with its first chapter alone.", "timestamp_created": 1471508654, "timestamp_updated": 1471510246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.78832244873046875", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43941565": {"recommendationid": "43941565", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277266181", "num_games_owned": 807, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506602131}, "language": "english", "review": "Half-life transformed the game industry\n\nOne of the best single player games so far\n\n\n+ worth it to buy", "timestamp_created": 1533452642, "timestamp_updated": 1533452642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.755848944187164307", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15179112": {"recommendationid": "15179112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021009642", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428879501}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing through this game, I can see why so many people want a Half Life 3.", "timestamp_created": 1428029682, "timestamp_updated": 1441334280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 150, "votes_funny": 40, "weighted_vote_score": "0.840125560760498047", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7953248": {"recommendationid": "7953248", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970954853", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 54164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547079185}, "language": "english", "review": "A near-perfect first person shooter through a convincing, imaginative world filled with believable characters. If you haven't played it already then you should, it holds up well against recent titles and embarrasses a fair few.\n\nThe game has so many little touches that make it better than its competitors. The shotgun has a tight blast radius, so it's effective even at considerable distances. The gravity gun gave meaning to the rubbish strewn across the levels. Who would have thought a radiator could serve as a weapon, a shield and a useful platform to reach high-up areas? The grenades are satisfyingly clunky, the explosive barrels are meaty and I wish that they sold bugbait stress balls. It's probably the nicest sounding weapon in the world (and beyond).\n\nThis game needs no introduction. It's the game that single-handedly brought Steam onto desktop PCs everywhere. It had to live up to the standards set by the original and it surpassed it in every way. Graphically it was ahead of its time, with detailed character animations and convincing CLUTTER all over the world. Each level leads straight on from the previous so you can almost draw a mental map of City 17 as you journey towards the looming Citadel in the centre. You can see the sun slowly setting as the levels progress and distant sirens and explosions really draw you into the Eastern-European themed city. There's something very lonely about the echo of a gun shot on the cliff levels.\n\nEvery chapter has its own theme and alterations to the gameplay. You'll find yourself in vehicles, or battling against a certain type of enemy, or battling WITH that type of enemy against another sort. It really makes me wonder why other developers bother even trying to compete with the creativity that this title offers.\n\nIs it perfect? Nhggghhh, almost. I could say that the vehicle sections go on for a bit too long and the quiet, talky sections (which used to be my favourite- LOOK AT THEIR FACES!) have aged a bit. I find myself hitting things with a crowbar, waiting for more enemies to kill.\n\nSeriously, if you don't enjoy this game then first person shooters aren't for you.", "timestamp_created": 1386424624, "timestamp_updated": 1386424624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.814257502555847168", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7747612": {"recommendationid": "7747612", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969691120", "num_games_owned": 1455, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1383364384}, "language": "english", "review": "Half-Life 2 is a BLAST to play. Pretty much everything in the game is interactive. You pick up paint cans with the gravity gun and when the can hits, it splatters the object with paint. It always fun to pick up a saw blade and toss it at a creature splitting it in half. If its there you can almost be assured that it can be used.\n\nThe controls in Half-Life 2 are the exact same as the original Half-Life so veterans will be able to pick up and go very easily. For newcomers to the series the controls are very easy to pick up and very practical. After playing with this control scheme you probably will set all of your FPS games to it.\n\nI played the game in normal difficulty and it was pretty challenging, but not too hard. I found myself reloading a lot, and even after doing parts in the games over and over again I was still having fun trying to pass it, unlike some other games I have tried. Even though you may load a lot I found that ammo was hardly an issue. The supply crates are pretty much random and give you what you need the most. So if you are running low in shotgun shells, the next crate probably will contain some. This is helpful but at times I felt that I had too much ammo.\n\nThe story takes place a number of years after the Black Mesa incident. The G-man awakes you on a train and talks to you for a moment and then vanishes. You soon get off the train and arrive at a place called \u201cCity 17\u201d, ran by a dictator figure known as Dr. Breen, your former administrator at Black Mesa. You don't really know why you are there, or how you got there and the Combine roaming around the streets don't seem too friendly. You play through the entire game through Gordon Freeman's eyes really immersing you in the game.\n\nI was always in awe throughout the whole game. This game has the best graphics I have seen on any game. The people look life-like. They display their emotions so well that you know what they are feeling. The buildings and the atmosphere are awe-inspiring. You may never want to leave City 17 after you see its beauty. The different lighting in each area was great. You actually felt like you were progressing through the game when you start out in day time, and soon you see the sun setting and then it gets dark again.\n\nThe music in this game was awesome. You could tell when a big battle was coming because the music would start playing, and your blood would start pumping. The music made the game that much more enjoyable. I listen to the soundtrack and I can see the battles without actually playing the game. That in my opinion is what makes the battles so great.\n\nThe sound in the game was great. I loved the sound the combines made when they died. Each character had a distinct voice and had astounding voice acting. I have never been as freaked in a game when I hear a howl off in the distance and hear a rain gutter banging letting me know that a fast zombie is climbing up after me. The only reason why this score got a 9 is that there is some stuttering when the game loads or auto saves which can be very annoying.\n\nThis game took me more than 20 hours to complete after playing around in the game with the physics and such, so it wasn't that short of a game, especially for an FPS. This game is definitely replayable. After playing through the game I invited my friend over so he could play it. He found different ways to kill creatures and solve puzzles that I never thought of, so that in itself is a great reason to replay the game. Also the game on hard is much more difficult than normal giving you more challenge as you go around a second time. Why an 8 then? Well the multiplayer is non-existent as of right now so I can't see myself playing it as much as I could be.\n\n\nReviewer's Score: 10/10 | Originally Posted: 11/22/04", "timestamp_created": 1385414186, "timestamp_updated": 1511464458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 296, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.856957376003265381", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43266753": {"recommendationid": "43266753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040568061", "num_games_owned": 587, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519732682}, "language": "english", "review": "if you won't pick up half life 2 for 99 cents you're a coward", "timestamp_created": 1530613410, "timestamp_updated": 1530613410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768265843391418457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13850775": {"recommendationid": "13850775", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994005948", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1529200396}, "language": "english", "review": "Six years is a long wait for a sequel, but it was well worth it.

It is the same game anyways.\n\nHalf-Life 2 is a First Person Shooter made in 2004 by Valve and published by Vivendi, since 2005 it is published by Valve itself. The game has been released on PC, Xbox, Xbox 360, Playstation 3, Macintosh and Nvidia Shield. Through all those years the game is still considered one of the best video games ever made, which is obvious when you look on all those \"Half-Life 3 confirmed\" memes.\n\nStory takes place two decades after events of the first installment, the G-man wakes Gordon Freeman from his slumber and teleports him into the train to dystopian City 17 ruled by Combinate lead by Dr. Breen. Our protagonist joins the resistance but then things go wrong on the way I cannot explain without using spoilers. In any case he meets many convincing and charismatic characters. The ending is kind of a cliffhanger but it is continoued in Episode 1 so I guess it is nothing bad, besides the entire plot works really good.\nOf course there is no denying that the most liked part of this game is the gameplay, thanks to the Source engine it was quite revolutionary. Gordon moves proceeds through chapters using various vehicles, parts of environment and weapons (especially the known and like gravity gun). Different sections force us to plan our movements during battles and use all the available items or support as possible (Traps, turrets, mines and many more), hitboxes are not really legit because no matter if you shoot the head or other parts of NPC's body he or she will receive the same damage (except headcrab zombies). Every chapter have it's own unique mechanics allowing us to use some irregular ways to eliminate the obstacles or simply to survive.\nLevel design and visuals of locations are astonishing, all thanks to Viktor Antonov, the same man who designed Dunwall in Dishonored. All the places we visit are colorful, some contain secrets and multiple ways to use. The best example is for sure Ravenholm by giving us a dose of horror, yet also creativity in terms of gameplay.\nSoundtrack is quite unusual here, mostly there will be no music, but in more intense sequences awesome tracks start to play and they are fitting always perfectly. If we count other sounds as OST we also have some ripped straight from Half-Life 1 and a various palette of other ones hearable during interactions with multiple objects.\nIf you like looking for any technical issues or glitches then you will be very dissapointed, after so many years of patching there is nothing left. The only one thing that could be annoying are letters that become really small on higher resolutions (for me it was not a problem but I am talking about 1080p, if we count that someone has GPU able to run it in 4K...oh God...). There is nothing to worry about the performance, my PC was able to max it out with 250-290 frames per second and it is not even a high-end one (at least on 2018 standards).\n\nMany people love Half-Life 2 and I have to admit that they really have reasons to it, the only thing that I do not get is considering Alyx Vance as one of the best female character ever but I think that is only a matter of taste. I was amazed by the depth of gameplay and all the hard work put into it. Story is quite simple and enjoyable, yet understanding every part of it is impossible for those who never touched the first installment which is perhaps the only downside in this game. Soundtrack does not play often but when it does it rocks, all the technicals also work perfectly, I suggest playing it with Update mod because the eyes hurt a bit less and it is easy downloadable by Steam Shop for free. \nFor me personally it deserves 9.8/10, it is a shame that most of modern games still cannot reach that level though.", "timestamp_created": 1528280282, "timestamp_updated": 1528280282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.790325701236724854", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36750396": {"recommendationid": "36750396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129787920", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 4096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512820542}, "language": "english", "review": "What can i say?

It was as if I was transported back in time to high school when I opened up the original packaging and installed the game along with Counter-Strike: Source from 5 CDs. \n\nThe flow of the action set-pieces, the art direction, the sound design, the voice acting and facial animation are so masterfully done that I feel any criticism towards the game would feel nitpicking. I would say that the shooting can feel a bit bland but this is easily balanced out by a huge variety of weapons, levels, and player encounters.\n\nWhen it comes to first-person shooters, it doesn\u2019t get any better than this. Half-Life 2 was so ahead of its time that even today, many games only try to emulate its excellent design. It is rather funny how, after 14 years, we should be playing with games that are better by leaps and bounds but this is far from the case.\n\nIf you consider yourself a gamer, you owe it to yourself to have it in your library.\n", "timestamp_created": 1532448618, "timestamp_updated": 1532448618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.72696232795715332", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17016871": {"recommendationid": "17016871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043600087", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463670326}, "language": "english", "review": "Was my first steam game.

Right from the start of the first chapter, Half Life 2 never failed to amaze me by its spectacular map view after you walk out from a certain point of the game. The combination of sound effects, the astounding map lightings, even the movement and behaviour of the AI soldier (well... mostly) creates a solid realistic feels to the game itself, that gives a good first impression to the players of what the surrounding is going to be.\n\nThe combat in Half Life 2 feels more lively compared to the first Half Life, the Manhunt, the flashing drones and the soldiers are more intelligent that adds a lot of challenges and varieties into the combat scene. Zombies models are well-improved, the voices for the zombies plus the jumpscare events creates a good mix of panic and suspense feels, thus forcing players to act faster and be decisive during the playthrough. The weapons are well designed, the animations and the sounds of them are great that makes the shooting experience a lot more fun. One thing I don't like a bit, is that the accuracy of the rifle and smg are bad, that bursting and tapping doesn't make any difference. Let's just not nitpick about it, Half Life 2 is already greater than I can imagine.\n\nNow what's Half Life without puzzle? they're created with more variaties attached to, most of them involves physics while the others are fun to discover and solve. The lazer pointer that guides the rocket launcher's missile, the boat and buggy shoot-while-driving scene, they're all creative, very fun to play, and gives a lot of joy after you actually solved it by yourself.\n\nI honestly feel that the thing that makes Half Life 2 great game, is that how enjoyable it is for all ages. There's lore attached to it, there's also story-related events that makes the play a lot more entertaining, that I'm very recommending this to people who are willing to try something enjoyable.\nFor the people who actually OWN this game but never play it, sad that you've missed a part of the FPS history...", "timestamp_created": 1481974109, "timestamp_updated": 1484562967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 82, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.806575596332550049", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "2380659": {"recommendationid": "2380659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006581408", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 154, "playtime_forever": 607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1350716400}, "language": "english", "review": "play as a guy in a metal life jacket", "timestamp_created": 1316737190, "timestamp_updated": 1385422608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 180, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.824726402759552002", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28629391": {"recommendationid": "28629391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009249098", "num_games_owned": 391, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 5989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1527508590}, "language": "english", "review": "The game that got me into PC gaming.

I can be very lethal with a controller in hand. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said with a mouse and keyboard. To remedy this disparity, I figured I'd re-enter the world of arguably the most famous PC games of all time... Half-Life 2.\n\nI played this game back when it was packaged in \"The Orange Box\" for the Xbox 360. It was definitely enjoyable back then, and there is very little drop off over the years. Sure, the graphics aren't up to par with modern-day games, but they hold up a lot better than the original Half-Life. \n\nThe gameplay is very fluid. I found the machine gun and shotgun to be my two most used weapons outside of the gravity gun. I used the machine gun regularly throughout the entire game, and it excelled in medium-range combat. However, it had nothing over the shotgun in close-range scenarios. There were many times in which the shotgun kept me safe when I was caught off guard.\n\nSpeaking of getting caught off guard, this game had plenty of moments that startled me or made me jump from my seat. I mean, I've beaten this game over a decade ago. Yet, I seem to have forgetton how great this game is. The little instances in which some headcrab or other enemy popped up from around the corner or from some dark location scared me more than any other \"Horror\" movie or game has, ever! \n\nThe environments are well-thought out. There are plenty of objects to interact with, and there are forty-five health caches scattered throughout the game for those who wish to explore every nook and cranny that this game has to offer. \n\nThe entire story is presented while you control the protagonist, Gordon Freeman. There are no cutscenes. Instead, you can walk around and pay as much (or as little) attention that you'd like to the dialogue. Consequently, I found myself more enthralled by the events that took place. I lived in this world, and I cared about what happened.\n\nI'm sure that most people reading this review have already beaten this game, and that's fine. This game has been around for a while. That being said, this classic game deserves to be played again. It may not have the most memorable story, but it has some memorable set-pieces, and the enemies can be challenging at higher difficulties. Simply put, Half-Life 2 is a complete game that ages like fine wine. I appreciate this game a lot more now than I did over ten years ago.
