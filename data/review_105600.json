Whether it\u2019s improving your house or collecting every piece of armor. This game has a lot to offer and how this game has grown since release is insane and don\u2019t get me started on mods. This game is worth every penny for how much gameplay you get out of this game. The graphics make the game look very childish and the colours but it\u2019s very much grown up for how the game is played like fighting bosses and the gathering of materials, it can be grindy. \n\nThe game is about a player in a 2D pixelated world where the basis of the game is to fight monsters and bosses to get stronger. The progression to become more powerful throughout the game is very rewarding like hermes boots or wings, you appreciate the increased movement heavily and it becomes almost impossible to play without them once you become familiar. \n\nI love this game and have spent a lot of time with friends which makes the game even better. The loot isn\u2019t shared on multiplayer which is a bit awkward at times when loot is rare, sometimes people will be ahead based on the luck of chests but this can become easier when that person assists you on finding the same item. This game is enjoyable in single player but is always better with friends but the aim is to become strong enough to fight the wall of flesh. This game will constantly have you searching up items and crafting with the extensive amount of items in the game which adds to the playability. The game will grow on you as you play since the start up of the game is slow compared to the ending but it leaves for more invested time in your character. The satisfaction of having a armor set and upgrading defence or obtaining good items like horseshoe or cloud in a jar. These equipable items are very helpful and necessary at the start to climbing to higher and stronger enemies. \n\nIn conclusion, this game is very enjoyable but the world feels boring on a 2D environment. The startup for the game is slow especially when playing the game before. It is very rewarding if you play the game out and slowly upgrade, the fishing challenges is a nice touch to something different to fighting since the game is mostly killing and mining. I hate to say it but has a formula like minecraft but I feel this game has more content and the mods are insane. They add even more gameplay to the game with more items, ores and more.\n\n7/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1549756155, "timestamp_updated": 1549756155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.828923523426055908", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49020612": {"recommendationid": "49020612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075412929", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 197428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 957, "last_played": 1551246016}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely worth the money, and there are so many features and possibilities that you can play it for hundreds and thousands of hours without it getting boring.

It feature the classic collect materials and build stuff gameplay. But instead of a 3D environment it has a 2D perspective. Released in 2011, Terraria is one of Re-Logic most successful game with millions of copies sold and many different ports onto a various selection of gaming platforms. Personality I love the game most since it features gameplay I enjoy, mine material, make weapons and armor, and take down evil forces.\n\nGameplay in Terraria is a pretty standard by now. chop down wood, make a house, build tools and gear, mine for ores, and defeat monsters. But while it is very common nowadays its still very solid and a perfect way to increase your hours. Speaking of crafting, there is so much stuff you can craft, such as different blocks, crafting materials, different weapons, and utility items. There are also plenty of different NPCs to house and in return you can purchase items from them with the currency system.\n\nInclude are plenty of biomes with different types of enemies and extra goodies, like Pyramids in the Desert biome  or the Underground section of the lush Jungle biome. There are also 3 types of special biomes. Crimson and Corruption will eat your world if they're not handle, one has a very bloody theme while the other features a more dark theme. Then there is the Hallow with bright colors, Pixies, and murderous Unicorns, luckily this Biome unlock in Hardmode which I will get to later.\n\nAnother cool thing about Terraria is the many invasions and Bosses. Invasions can happen randomly during gameplay but they can be manually summoned and feature a onslaught of unique enemies which is very useful for grinding for currency or other items. Some invasions have mini-bosses as a part of the action. Now with the Bosses. Terraria's Bosses are crucial to proceed with the game, as their defeat activates certain things in the overworld. Most of the Pre-Hardmode are pretty easy once you have the right gear but the Hardmode Bosses offer a greater challenge. However I do wish you didn't have to defeat them in order to make something happen, just a tiny inconvenience.\n\nNow I should talk about Hardmode, once you defeat the Wall of Flesh, a special boss in the Underworld, the game kickstarts into Hardmode with tougher enemies and bosses but with more biome and better gear. I'd say that 70% of the game is in Hardmode so, be prepared to be challenged. Speaking of which there is the Expert mode with is even tougher but has some special items you cannot get from the other modes of the game.\n\nVisually, I love the pixel art-style for this game, it has kinda stuck over time but that does help the developers make some gorgeous looking pixel art for the bosses, as they are huge compared to the player. The background are also a fun part for the eyes as there are different background for each biome.\n\nThe Soundtrack is also very constructed with some memorable tunes, I won't get much here as the soundtrack itself is reviewable.\n\nOverall, Terraria's success comes from is simple, yet effective gameplay with mining and defeating monsters. Pretty much anyone could pick up and play this game as its presentation is great for new players. And if the content isn't enough for you there are always Mods and they have shown to be very, very expansive. I kinda wish this game gets Workshop support to make getting said mods a bit easier but I digress. Terraria is well worth its 10$ price tag, but its sale price of $5 is even more incredible considering what you get in the base game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1551375808, "timestamp_updated": 1551375808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.71133655309677124", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49047071": {"recommendationid": "49047071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142092342", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 67403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 646, "last_played": 1551862916}, "language": "english", "review": "I've had this game for about six years, and I've beat it countless times.

At first game is a bit slow and can require some strategy to traverse the land, which can be very fun if you get better at it, and getting tools to help you with traversing the land can be very useful. There is plenty of items in this game which could be gear, weapons, blocks, and even just simple items to goof around with. I have played 700+ hours currently and I haven't gotten bored yet, some people have 1000+ hours. This game has plenty of challenge especially in hardmode, with bosses and even some enemies being very difficult if you don't know their attacks and didn't prepare. After defeating a boss your world will go into hardmode permanently, and whole array of new things become available to you along with new bosses as I mentioned earlier.\nEven if it's a 2d game, you can build some really amazing stuff in this game with all the blocks you can find in this game. After a while, you can build houses for NPCs if you meet curtain requirements, like increasing your max health for a nurse, or having an amount of coins on you, etc. The bosses in this game get really cool and have some nice drops that you look can look forward to and then have fun after you get them, it's usually a really good reward in the stage of the game you kill the boss in. This game can get really complex sometimes with crafting recipes and such, you can go to the first NPC the guide for crafting recipes, but you may want to look on the wiki sometimes. The guide can lead you in the right direction if you're not sure what to do if you do actually talk to him, if you get bored of the game, you can always try waiting a month or so, creating a new character with a challenge in mind, downloading some mods, or multiplayer, multiplayer can be very fun.", "timestamp_created": 1549755620, "timestamp_updated": 1549755620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603960394859313965", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48815287": {"recommendationid": "48815287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097930236", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1551753220}, "language": "english", "review": "better than minecraft lel", "timestamp_created": 1549518617, "timestamp_updated": 1549518617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538106262683868408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49298578": {"recommendationid": "49298578", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327528462", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1551458610}, "language": "english", "review": "must have great game, very cool. gamer moment", "timestamp_created": 1551458370, "timestamp_updated": 1551458370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49303153": {"recommendationid": "49303153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121102409", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 1630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1630, "last_played": 1551550909}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is actually INCREDIBLE.

No, Terraria is an experience.\n\nA little similar to minecraft, you start with nothing..\nWell, aside for few basic tools. But you are weak and defenseless. Good thing that all of enemies around you seem to be derpy slimes.\nSo you collect some wood, build a work bench and you decide you should create a little box around you because night is falling and you're not sure if you're capable of taking on whatever is going to come. This is where game begins.\n\n\nTerraria perfectly encompasses the feeling of progression. You start weak, and you can work to make yourself stronger. You can craft armor, craft better weapons, find some different weapons, which will trigger some NPC-s to move into your house, and from them you can buy even better weapons and tools. And then you use those better weapons and tools to make or find even better weapons and tools.\nAnd because there will always be enemies that will be able to overpower you, you will never feel as if you're grinding for the sake of grinding.\nAnd game progresses at your own pace, but it will try to stir things up a few times to make sure things don't get stale. And it will usually do this if it thinks you are ready for it.\n\nA game this is commonly compared to is Minecraft, but make no mistake, this is not Minecraft.\nThis game is so much bigger and more complex than Minecraft. While in minecraft you usually go for stone, then iron then diamond, in Terraria you have so much more different materials. In minecraft you have 5 different kinds of armor and in Terraria you have donzens.\nSome of which even provide different playstyles (such as bee armor).\nAnd that brings me to another point.\nTerraria doesn't get stale because it has so many different ways to play it.\nSo many different items that provide different functionalities. You can't have it all, after all there is limited amount of inventory space. So you must commit to one or two ways of playing the game. And you will keep progressing until the literal end of the game. And after that you are free to do what you want.\n\n\nGame is extremely fun and satisfying.\nIt has quite a lot of replay value (trust me, I know).\nThere are many ways to play it.\nIt also receives plenty of updates still to this day.\nAnd you don't need a powerful computer to run it.\n\nIt is definitely worth 10 euro it costs, and even more so when it's on sale!\nI wholeheartedly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1549651410, "timestamp_updated": 1549651410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48858448": {"recommendationid": "48858448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327794022", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 40767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1571, "last_played": 1551752607}, "language": "english", "review": "This is like minecraft, but 10x more content, 2d, and with more modding potential.", "timestamp_created": 1549670028, "timestamp_updated": 1549670028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48797918": {"recommendationid": "48797918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104000159", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 40, "last_played": 1550771227}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1549456657, "timestamp_updated": 1549456657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505494534969329834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48801942": {"recommendationid": "48801942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158407108", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "last_played": 1550742454}, "language": "english", "review": "too good to be true.\n\n\n\njust amazing", "timestamp_created": 1549468234, "timestamp_updated": 1549468234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48803957": {"recommendationid": "48803957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367462426", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550148237}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1549473674, "timestamp_updated": 1549473674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48804078": {"recommendationid": "48804078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198868116590", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 170, "last_played": 1551104307}, "language": "english", "review": "love the game \n\nwold be more fun if i had friends to play with tho", "timestamp_created": 1549473995, "timestamp_updated": 1549473995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48801851": {"recommendationid": "48801851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086316082", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 10179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550068929}, "language": "english", "review": "Must have.", "timestamp_created": 1549467969, "timestamp_updated": 1549467969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48866246": {"recommendationid": "48866246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114702050", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 23755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547338783}, "language": "english", "review": "Tis a good game 10/10 would game again.", "timestamp_created": 1549702912, "timestamp_updated": 1549702912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48868994": {"recommendationid": "48868994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198817847387", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 31, "last_played": 1550866876}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so good for people who love crafting like me!

Perhaps because it only has 2 dimensions rather than 3. This may go some way as to explaining why the game is nearly always priced at $10 and even lower on sale. And believe me, that's high praise, relating this game to something as popular, beloved, well-renowned, and just as well-respected as Minecraft.\nBut onto the actual mechanics of the game. Just as with many games of the survival genre, you start out with nothing and work your way up to high leveled equipment reminiscent of the early days of WoW. (That's \"World of Warcraft\" for you young'uns out there.)  All the while you will be collecting items, objects, and materials, fashioning for yourself tools with which you will conquer the hordes of danger to come your way! So yeah, the game is standard fare for many players of survival games. HOWEVER, there are some notable differences that make this game, both, a bastion for warmongers and a creative mainstay for all players alike. The wide array of varying enemies based on environment compounded by the much higher amount of creative biomes give both crowds much more than Minecraft ever did. (Although, that is still a [i]fine[/i] game.) In addition, the more biomes that exist, the more objects that exist in the world, often with their own rules, effects, and tricks to using them. Therefore more possibilities exist. Just as well, there are many events that pop up in the game depending on the time you've spent in the world and what you've done. Oftentimes, during these events, bosses will appear in which you will have to fight and succeed. After which, you can loot for many gains and glory all round! This game, like many in the survival genre is much more fun with friends and with the pretty low price tag, why wouldn't you get this for a friend? They won't be disappointed, I assure you ... and [b]WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS, OMG JUST GO GET IT![/b] $10 was all it took to experience this masterpiece of a game and I have friends that easily put 1,000 hours into this game and would gladly put in many more. Obviously there must be something very compelling about the game if one would willingly dedicate that much time to a game that had been overshadowed by a much more successful title.", "timestamp_created": 1550879757, "timestamp_updated": 1550915798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49189605": {"recommendationid": "49189605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142949517", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 72172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1550935249}, "language": "english", "review": "Very, very good game.

Lots of weapons, armor, cosmetics, and building material. It's crazy\n- A good healthy serving of cool and interesting bosses to fight\n- Lots of NPC's to buy stuff from (be ready to build basically a hotel for the like 30 of them in the game now)\n- Really good retro soundtrack but more modern, that fit the creative environments they pair with. Boss fight music gets you pumped! \n- Is it too easy for you? Try Expert mode! Don't feel like you're penalized enough for dying? Set your character to Hardcore!\n- I almost forgot to mention\u2026 SO MUCH CRAFTING\n\nCons? Hmm.\n\n- Inventory management\u2026 the abundance of items will overwhelm you. I usually make a structure dedicated to storing all my loot in chests. Stay organized!\n- Fishing is pretty useful but\u2026 well it\u2019s not exactly exciting. You can get some great stuff that way though.\n- Expect a big difficulty spike after defeating the boss in the Underworld! You\u2019ll feel like a noob all over again, but once you work past it is where the game feels like it truly begins for me.\n- Some items in the game are pretty rare and some of these rares are used to craft or otherwise obtain some of the best loot in the game. \n\nOther thought: \n- If you can play with friends, or find people to run through the game with, do it. It's much more fun that way. You can still enjoy it quite a bit single player, however... it's not the same when you can't laugh when someone gets destroyed by a boulder trap.\n\nStory time (if you want to torture yourself and read my rambling):\n\nI bought this game ages ago, back when it was still in development, before any of the expansions and cleanups it's gone through. I spent $10 on this.\n\nSince then, the Dev team (at least back in 2014-2015 or so when I kept up with it) would post threads about once a month at the least to let people know what was planned/ the progress of the game. It kept getting updated, adding more content and mechanics. I remember being super excited when new weapon types were added, rare mounts were added. Accessories so your character can fly around the map? Gimme. Something I always admire too is Re-Logic did not simply focus on adding more stuff end game, they kept polishing up early game too, adding things like Ropes to make things easier until you get hookshots, simple versions of weapons you find later like Spears, wooden yo-yo, more early game magic items. It used to be a much less enjoyable, slower grind to get to mid game content where the pace picks up.\n\nThere were at least a couple times where the development with the game was supposedly going to halt, and I was satisfied with it then. I'd gotten more content and enjoyment out of Terraria than most games I'd bought for $30 or more. Yet somehow, maybe a year after hearing nothing, a new content update would surprisingly be pushed out. This happened at least twice, when I thought it would be laid to rest as is. \n\nI spent $10 on this.", "timestamp_created": 1545722580, "timestamp_updated": 1547331346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 593, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.973003149032592773", "comment_count": 25, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32026626": {"recommendationid": "32026626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105353915", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 23482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550424463}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly, I don't know why Terraria has so many haters.

When you're ingame (and I don't really know how to explain it) there's just something very chilling about it, maybe it's the music, maybe it's just every little detail about it.

[/h1]\nThis is the sort of game that you boot up thinking you'll spend an hour or two on, only to one day wake up face down on your keyboard surrounded by bottles and plates wondering where the past 3 weeks went. 100 hours in and I've still not defeated the current 'final' boss, something that's a mixture of the games' excellent difficulty curve, and a melancholy realisation that once I defeat him, my time with the game will naturally come to an end. \n\nPrimarily, Terraria is a sandbox game. You appear in a new world with some basic equipment and no real instruction, eventually you will build a small house to survive the monsters that surface during the night, discover some form of corruption eating away at the world, encounter new NPCs and face off against powerful Boss enemies. Despite all this, you are given little direction, these are merely facets of a larger game that allows players to do as they wish, encountering all the world has to offer at mostly their own pace. Part of the great design behind the title is in the difficulty curve I mentioned earlier, meaning challenges pitted against a player start easy and steadily increase at a rate easy to handle. Although traditional RPG elements are largely absent, a discrete levelling system is present in the form of Bosses that have been defeated, meaning if you don't progress through these enemies then the gameplay doesn't become more difficult. In fact, the first boss doesn't spawn until you're suitably equipped with armour and health. \n\nMy hours in the game are split roughly equally between single and multiplayer. Single player stands up on its own perfectly fine, but in my opinion the game is much more rewarding gathering some friends and working together to tackle the bosses, as the feeling of reaching new goals is shared, and the ammount of 'grinding' for materials is spread across multiple people. It also helps to appreciate the brilliant soundtrack, as if you voice chat with your group then spontaneous humming along loudly is to be expected. \n\nEnemy design is exciting and unique, with floating eyes, possessed suits of armour, giant robotic worms, and a ninja suspended in a giant ball of slime all making appearances. That being said, whoever on the design team is responsible for 'hellbats' has earned a special sort of hatred from myself...\n\nAll in all Terraria is an amazing experience from beginning to end, its tone is humourous at times whist still provoking a feeling of wonderment and mystery in its exploration, and fearful excitement at its combat. It's a game I will come back to time and time again looking to recapture the memories I've made, and to forge new ones. It is a rare game in that with no shred of a doubt, these hours I have spent were not wasted. I heartily recommend that you purchase this game. \n\n[i] Fortune and glory kid...

It's not a game where players must fear losing progress due to forgetting safety measures or manage breakable tools. The game knows how to bring out a sense of enjoyment and achievement. Grinding is an option, not a requirement or an excuse to drag out game time. Besides, there is much to discover and do in the game. Clocking in at 1,000+ hours, having all 88 achievements, and introducing multiple friends to the game should be indicative of that. With that being said, I'll list some pros/cons I've found memorable.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n    [*][b]Customization[/b]: There is a staggering amount of customization available in-game. You not only can choose from several basic character designs but also have a plethora of armors, costumes, accessories, and pets for your character. You can also color/dye any of your equipment and get all sorts of flashy effects. Dyes aren't consumable, so you have few restrictions on perfecting your assemblage.\n    [*][b]Exploration[/b]: The [i]Terraria[/i] world may be finite, but it is incredibly diverse. Each biome has its own personality and houses many unique elements. It takes a minimum of three worlds to discover everything, and that's only with absurd luck (see \"The Creation of the Guide\" painting). The game additionally has an impressive number of flavor. That rubble on the ground can be dug up, and a Worm might pop out from it. You can reignite the burnt-out Campfire in that small cavern. You didn't think that NPCs could fend for themselves during a Blood Moon or invasion, did you? Just when you think you've learned everything about the [i]Terraria[/i] world, you discover something surprising.\n    [*][b]Creativity[/b]: [i]Terraria[/i] is as much as about creating your world as it is exploring it. Blocks and furniture are not just for aesthetics, but they also introduce some neat mechanics. Players looking to engineer stuff will enjoy the contraptions possible by the wiring mechanic, and designers will love being able to paint the overworld with a wide spectrum of colors. [i]Terraria[/i] features innovative design at its finest.\n    [*][b]Progression options[/b]: Like any good RPG, there's a great sense of progress made in a playthrough. You mine or slay enemies for the materials needed to upgrade equipment, and the world is bountiful enough that this progress never feels linear or constrained. Even the achievements flow nicely, never feeling too easy, cheap, or absurdly difficult.\n    You never need to rely crutch items to make progress. Rather, in my experience, my friends and I frequently [i]had too many options[/i] and had to reluctantly store away some of our neat loot. There is always something to switch to if a playstyle becomes easy or repetitive.\n    [*][b]Balance[/b]: A game can become boring if there is a certain playstyle players fall into. [i]Terraria[/i] manages to find the right balance so that all playstyles have a fair shot at completing the game. There is no bottleneck or singular Infinity+1 Sword needed for progress.\n    [*][b]Diversity[/b]: [i]Terraria[/i] promotes itself as a game for any type of player, and that claim certainly has truth in it. The game has gameplay suited for battlers, explorers, and builders, and I can also tack on several options that appeal to other types of players. Collectors will balk at the quantity of items and achievements offered, and players can challenge themselves to make progress with nearly any conduct. Play with only melee/ranged/magic/summoning weapons? Sure. A yo-yo only run? That's popular! No crafting/mining? Certainly. Play the entire game upside-down? Of course--and that's bug-free! If that's not enough, you can fire up a world in Expert Mode for the extra challenge. There's something for everyone.\n    I've had a friend who would ask on his first playthrough 'Can I do ____ in the game?' and I could answer in the positive the majority of the time. Just for starters, you can teleport, build trap-filled dungeons, set up PVP minigames, and record the soundtrack. The game's breadth is incredible.\n    [*][b]Automation[/b]: [i]Terraria[/i] would be daunting without any form of automation. You have thousands of items, hundreds of monsters, dozens of mechanics, and an expansive world to build on or dig through. The game offers much to ease the burden of management. Auto-select picks the right tool rather than requiring manual selection. The smart cursor allows for one-click digging. Quick-stacking is much more convenient than depositing items one-by-one, chest-by-chest. Farming is not only feasible but easy. Making measured builds is simplified with items like the Ruler. The game naturally provides the player ease-of-use tools so a playthrough can be focused on the fun stuff rather than on chores.\n    [*][b]Performance[/b]: Many games fall off a prospective player's wishlist due to system requirements. [i]Terraria[/i] is a game that features a crazy amount of sprites, particle effects, physics, lighting, and entity interaction. Being a 2-D game only nets you that much speed before optimizations come into play *cough*[i]Starbound[/i]*cough*. The game's requirements are reasonable and the gameplay is optimized such that it doesn't require a bulky system to run on. I was able to run it decently on a 2007 year-old desktop on Windows XP with low-end specifications. The performance of the game to medium- and some low-end systems makes it accessible to a broad demographic of players. On the other hand, if you have a high-end system, go ahead and fire up that Color lighting mode and enjoy [i]Terraria[/i] in its full glory.\n    [*][b]Quality of life[/b]: Many games have little quirks that people have to accept to enjoy. Not only is [i]Terraria[/i]'s gameplay mainly devoid of bugs, but it also buffs out these quirks. Players are separated from worlds, allowing for easy singleplayer-to-multiplayer transfer. Characters can ascend blocks without needing to jump. Chests containing items don't explode if you try to harvest them. Keys are easily remappable for those familiar with alternate control schemes. Quick-stacking skips 'favorite' items. You can use the in-game system for taking wide screenshots for giant builds. You can set player configurations to ease the smallest of annoyances. In general, you never feel you're fighting the game's controls and interface.\n    [*][b]Continued updates[/b]: It would be very easy for [i]Terraria[/i], as popular as it is, to offer game expansions as paid DLC. The developers, instead, make their continued updates absolutely free to owners of the game. The developer-community relationship is superb.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n    [*][b]New player friendliness[/b]: The in-game help system is stunted, and players can easily become overwhelmed by the ever-growing number of toys in [i]Terraria[/i]'s sandbox. Many people resort to a guide to help them through the game.\n    [*][b]Grinding[/b]: While the game does not require noticeable grinding to progress, several tangents in the game require patience and luck. That fancy teleportation item pretty much necessitates a farm in the Hallow. The last component of a PDA could be hundreds of monster drops or fishing quests away. At a rate of one quest per in-game day, the 200 fishing quests achievement would require 4,800 minutes (3 1/3 days) to complete without resorting to tricks. It can be frustrating to have an achievement be left incomplete as a stretch, yet [i]Terraria[/i] is not above this issue.\n    [*][b]Moddability[/b]: [i]Terraria[/i] is extensive enough that it doesn't need additional features, but people have been able to decode the game and develop external software and mods for a better game experience. It would be a boon if the game was open to the modding community for extended gameplay.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1463549474, "timestamp_updated": 1479961496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 272, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.940282642841339111", "comment_count": 26, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32140018": {"recommendationid": "32140018", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060212335", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 69352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1535508406}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played this game for 1,055 hours.\nThis is an amazing game.

As a player who had experienced the vanilla and the mod variant, I\u2019ll be commenting for both game experiences.\n\nThe vanilla [original] game present you with the basic components of how to play. While it can be a grind at the start to gather materials to build, in the later game you\u2019ll be introduced to more content, new areas, enemies and NPCs. The game is hugely focused on progression, which makes it quite an addiction to play. My favorite aspects of the game are the weapons and gear, plus the boss battles. No item is ever the same, as well as the monsters that we face. The aesthetics are also nice; the Plantera mask and kimono were one of my personal favorites to dress for my character. Lots of items in the game are customizable, including colour changes to upgrades for bonus stats.\n\nNow, for the mod version, there were even more available content for players. The mods my friends and I played with on his server were namely the Thorium Mod and Calamity mod. These mods added features such as more boss monsters, items, NPC and more. Some players will frown at mods and call it \u201ccheats\u201d and whatnot. However, this is not the case as it brings more complexity to the original game, and it's not intended for new players anyways. We played on Expert/Revengeance mode and fought additional bosses like Astrium Deus, and the Siren and Leviathan. In my experience, the modded variation provided and even more thrilling challenge than the Vanilla version. I recommend trying it after you\u2019ve completed the original game.\n\nIn general, Terraria is a must-play for anyone who hasn\u2019t done so.", "timestamp_created": 1533431987, "timestamp_updated": 1533734451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 210, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.92258983850479126", "comment_count": 17, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38211956": {"recommendationid": "38211956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280972195", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 24820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 419, "last_played": 1551865006}, "language": "english", "review": "we need steam Workshop\uff01\uff01\uff01\n\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u521b\u610f\u5de5\u574a\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1512916948, "timestamp_updated": 1515856363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 248, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.940439820289611816", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40345511": {"recommendationid": "40345511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171251965", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 47521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1535318140}, "language": "english", "review": "Terraria at first glance can be called a \"2D Minecraft\" from some viewers, but it surprisingly has a lot of differences.\n\nFor starters, while Terraria is indeed a 2D sandbox game, the main highlight of the game isn't just creating whatever you want, but working your way up from basic equipment up to [i]fighting space invaders and SQUIDLORD[/i]. ..er excuse me, the \"Moon Lord\".\n\nSpeaking of equipment, at no point what-so-ever do your tools or armor ever break. There's also currency in the form of bronze, silver, gold, and platinum coins which can be used to buy goods from friendly NPCs. Said friendly NPCs can appear if you fufill certain conditions and have a vacent room for them. So on and so forth there are [i]many[/i] differences between this and Minecraft that makes the whole comparison silly to bring up.\n\nThough I won't be praising [i]everything[/i] about the game, as it does have some flaws. For starters, while the PC version has [i]no[/i] tutorial, every other version of the game has one. There are console and mobile exclusive events, items, and even [i]music[/i] which was a personal pet peeve for me. Some accessories made from combining others together end up being less useful than if you were to use the two seperately or create an entirely different accessory, the fishing achievements are quite a nightmare to go after, and the beginning can be [i]VERY[/i] tedious, especially in Expert Mode. Throwing weapons are also useless past the Wall of Flesh, with a majority of items involving throwing capabilities being thrown out of the window by the time Skeletron comes around.\n\nDo these gripes of mine hinder the experience as a whole?\nI don't think so, and I still think the game is worth checking out if you're into games such as this.\n\nAn additional bonus, there's also a pretty awesome modding community for the game too, which adds even [i]more[/i] things you can do with the game long after you taken care of the vanilla game's final boss.

It also is very optimised and recieved lots of updates making building (Thank you for the smart Cursor) & moving around the world (Thank you for the different mounts) alot easier.\n\nTerraria is so Cheap but you can spend so much time on it. It basically is never ending fun and now with the achievements it will be easy ish to get 100%. The only grinding bit will be the fishing quests you'll need to do. \n\nThere is honestly so much to do and it is an absolut gem. You just have to try it out yourself and if you dont want to spend 10\u20ac (which is already really cheap for this kind of game) then you can always wait for a sale and grab it there!\n\nNow this Game might not have the best \"graphics\" but it is lovely the way it is and it shouldn't be in any other way. \n\nI highly recommend this Game to any Minecraft, Metroidvania & 100% Achievement Fan.

This is an \"adventure\" game. The game [i]is[/i] an adventure.\n\nA real adventure. Like when you take a shortcut through the wilderness, but end up further and further off path as you follow a stream, looking for a good place to cross.\n\nA real adventure. Like when you go hiking in the mountains and get lost. Only to realize it'll be quicker to get back to civilization by continuing forward, rather than returning the way you came.\n\nA real adventure. Like when you find yourself some place you've never been before, and with just a few tools, build yourself a makeshift home and defend it from zombies at night while exploring the world around you during the day. Eventually working your way underground into chasms filled with treasure and the occasional abandoned dwelling. Perhaps running across a giant beehive in an underground jungle or a buried pyramid under the desert. Finding your way deep into the darkness where the dead wander freely and mushrooms fluoresce brightly. Going deeper and deeper yet; to the point where the molten core of the planet lights up your eyes in a way only the sun had previously done.\n\nThe hard part of writing a review for a game like this is not spoiling too much while still letting people know how deep the game actually is. So much of what I enjoyed about my first playthrough of this game was [i]discovery[/i]. Terraria might seem too simple when you first start out, and then possibly even overwhelming. But you'll be glad you spent effort to follow the stream or continue forward through the mountains.\n\nThere's weapons and magic, but you never pick a class, like warrior or archer. Due to the wide range of weapons, accessories, and armor choices you'll suddenly realize at some point, perhaps when surrounded by your minions, that you've specialized as a summoner. Or that you're a wizard, or explosives expert. Or perhaps you're some unique archer-warrior hybrid. But your choices and discoveries have slowly lead you into your role; you never chose it from a drop down list.\n\nThere's a multitude of biomes to discover. Each with their own unique enemies, and of course, epic boss fights. There's an incredible number of things you can do as you progress through the game. And while it plays fine single player, if you have a friend or two you can bring with you on this journey, you'll have that much more fun and they will thank you for it.\n\nSure, you can spend hours upon hours building elaborate castles decorated with furniture you've crafted or statues you've collected from around the world. You can reshape the terrain around you - spreading biomes you like or cutting down those you don't. You can even bring biomes up from deep in the earth and set up the perfect potion mushroom farm right next to your base. One of my favorite things to do is to use the wiring system to set elaborate boobie traps around my fortifications. But you don't have to do [i]any[/i] of that to progress. It's really all up to you. Although even if none of that is \"your thing,\" you might be so drawn in that you find yourself happily engaged in such activities.\n\nAnd yes, a big part of the game is digging, but it's primarily a means of exploration. A means of reaching that next treasure chest, or cluster of gems. A means of reaching the next deep fissure in the earth.

If anything in my opinion it's a ton better. \nThe game is is mainly sandbox with some rpg elements. You get the choice of just solely using it as a sandbox(no creative like mode) or you choose certain builds, defeat bosses and an expert mode if your too good. The main builds are melee,magic,ranger and summoner. The terraria wiki(btw which is very helpful) goes into more detail on the pros and cons.\nThe crafting system in the game is also very good. Theres almost no need to have to find out how to craft things as you start with an npc who practically tells you everything you can craft with one item. You also only need to have the items in your inventory to craft rather than align them in some shape.\n\nThis game also has many npcs(just over 20) that mainly serve to sell or give certain info. They are quite straightforward to unlock and you keep them in houses you build. Certain npcs are quite helpful depending on the build you go for during the game.\n\nGaining money is also quite simple. This can range from defeating enemies, bosses and selling items to npcs.\n\nThere happens to be a plethora of items including tonnes of weapons and armour for each build and tonnes or craft able material from many many ores to item drops.\n\nTerraria also has a few biomes including evil biomes as well. All these biomes are quite useful with their own enemies and generic animals. You also unlock a biome after hardmode(more on that later). Terraria's map is not infinite an you set the size when creating. However there is no problem with this especially choosing a large map. Even the small map is big enough to explore many many hours and there still will be something you missed.\n\nThe game itself kinda has two parts which are pre hard mode and hardmode. Hardmode is triggered after defeating a certain boss and increases the amount of items obtainable, more bosses and another biome. \n\nThere happens to be events aswell which spawn different kind of enemies or are there to provide a sort of challenge. Some are random while most are summonable.\n\nHowever no game is perfect though. There is a bit of grinding to do especially if you want items and these can be really rare. Once you've defeated the final boss, the game is somewhat too easy except the only way for a challenge is expert mode(haven't experienced this mode). Items due tend to get useless especially items that are crafted by ore. Luckily this can be sold to make ingame money. While i dont mind the 2d graphics some may not enjoy it as much. Im sure there are a few more flaws but i cant think of any. In terms of stability, it's fairly stable and i have not seen a single bug at all.\n\nIm sure I missed quite a bit in this review but this game has so much to do. It can even be modded though I havent experienced that yet. Overall I highly recommend this game at even full price.", "timestamp_created": 1525457878, "timestamp_updated": 1525457878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 165, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.902656137943267822", "comment_count": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32843354": {"recommendationid": "32843354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198320546773", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1540533554}, "language": "english", "review": "Terraria is one of the best indie games ever created. There is so much to do in this game and so much to collect. Even after you invest dozens of hours there will still be monsters to hunt, bosses to fight, gear to craft, materials to find, and fun to be had. Take all of that and throw in friends and you will have a blast with this masterpiece.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay here is very simple overall, but the deep customization is what makes it so addicting and memorable. Combat is very simple, and has three main branches that you can follow: Melee, Range, and Magic. There are various weapons, trinkets, armor, and summons that will increase the potency of your talents and allow you to achieve maximum stats. This would mean nothing of course if there wasn't a huge cast of enemies to fight and there is: there are over 400 different enemies each with its own set of drops to be obtained. Fighting isn't the only thing you'll do though, as you'll also need a powerful and invulnerable shelter to house your possessions, NPCs, and spawnpoint, all the while keeping them safe from the hundreds of various threats. The sheer amount of different blocks, background tiles, and furniture ensure that you will never build the same house twice, unless you want to of course. The mining in this game is also addictive and fun. There are so many exotic treasures to be found in the underground along with dangerous enemies and fantastic biomes. Every ground level biome has its own cave that holds its respective gear type (Ex. Snow Biome Caves have ice swords) giving you tons to explore, loot, and conquer. Once you obtain powerful enough equipment and stats, you will eventually pit yourself against the game's many bosses which are doorways for new loot and new phases for your world to undergo. There is an unbelievable amount of content in this game and it all fits together so well. Considering the fact that this game will continue to be updated after the release of its sequel is a guarantee of the developer's hard work and consideration for the strong and ever growing community.\n\nOverall Score for Gameplay: 10/10\n\nStory: The story in this game is extremely minimal and more left to the speculation of individuals. What is certain is that your in a post apocalyptic type world that is overrun by deadly creatures and being taken over by evil and corruption. As you explore and upgrade your equipment you'll develop the world into a safer and pure place that the friendly NPCs can inhabit easier. In short, your a kind of guardian standing against the tide of evil that looks to spread throughout the world and consume it.  While there are some interesting tidbits given to you by the NPCs as to why your there and what your doing, they don't add too much. Fortunately, this game doesn't need a canon story to be good and is open enough for players to speculate what they think the game is about allowing them to create their own stories, which is really what makes this gem so special.\n\nOverall Score for Story: 9/10\n\nCharacters: The characters in this game are simply crafted, each NPC has its own personality but they aren't developed in any meaningful way and stay pretty much the same throughout the playthrough which is fine as their main purpose is to sell you goods. They are however pretty diverse and have enough character for the player to speculate them which fits in with the rest of the story nicely.\n\nOverall Score for Characters: 8/10\n\nGraphics: The graphics in this game fit the theme and overall feeling very well. The biomes are very different looking from one another, the NPCs all fit in nicely with the scenery, the building materials stand out from nature, and the particle effects are very nice. The visuals are timeless and will continue to serve this game well for many years to come.\n\nOverall Score for Graphics: 10/10\n\nSoundtrack: The soundtrack in this game is very nice and fits the mood well. Each biome has its own theme that truly brings it to life and gives it depth. Alternate music also plays for bosses which alerts the player to the rising difficulty and awards if he/she succeeds. The OST does its job very well and is definitely worth buying buy itself if your into that.\n\nOverall Score for Soundtrack: 9/10\n\nSound: The sound effects in this game are great. The ambient noise such as rain or wind are convincing and really bring the locations a sense of authenticity. With the hundreds and thousands of enemies, objects, material, and weapons, you'd think they make similar sounds but they do not which really improves the overall quality of the game. \n\nOverall Score for Sound: 10/10 \n\nSo yeah, this game is really something special and can be run on a laptop from the 90s so there is no excuse from a hardware or wallet standpoint not to pick this one up.

A hollow world till you arrive, teeming with precious ores, and dark secrets. Fetid swamps and dry deserts. \nThis game is definitely an endeavour, and it will soak up alot of your time as you try and reach the pinnacle of your characters limitations and how much you can construct. Often remarked as a \"2D Minecraft\" I always find this comparison woefully incorrect. Minecraft has a wide selection of enemies, which is similar, A wide array of ore and precious gems to mine, which is also similar. But from then one, Terraria leaves it dead in the water. An RPG experience, with substantial boss progression, Active try and retry game mechanics and spanning character classes, All inclusive of a massive crafting system, and wide assortment of things to collect and try. \nAnyways, I've praised it enough, lets get down to the review!\n\nGraphics: Probably one of the weaker points of the game, Its still very vibrant and holds upto despite its 2011, Birthdate.\nThis is mainly due to the pixelated graphics and 2D perspective of the game. Not alot to render, and not alot to process at any one time, Making it run very smoothly at any point in time, But also extremely limited due to there not being any sort of graphical options or benchmarks.\n\nGameplay: Where do i begin. This game plays, as well as you can play it. All the mechanics are there for you to make it work in your favor. But finding your niche and finding your work space is all crucial in you enjoying your time in Terraria.\nThe game drops you into a world, where you basically don't understand anything, A very limited spread of understanding, very few tools at your disposal, and a single NPC to help guide you along your journey. 4 classes to basically choose from as you progress through the game, Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner. All depending on how you want to play and how you prefer to play. Despite there being no relevant story or backstory to this game, there is a substantial amount of progression and ALOT of gear to rummage around for.\n\nStory: I think i pretty much covered this aspect of the game already. There really isn't a story here. Which is usually a game killer for me. I heavily invest in story driven worlds, And this world has none to speak of. I guess the story can be made up for each player, as to why you are doing what you're doing, but as for a story driven narrative. There isn't one.\n\nI don't often do a \"CONS\" section. But this game is so monstrous in terms of scope and size, I feel it's necessary to provide as much information as possible. I love this game to bits, this is perhaps the 3rd time i've played it through, Once on playstation, once on Xbox and now on PC. So i'm well aware of his rather frustrating flaws.\nSo here we are....\nCons: This game despite how much effort has been poured into it, Has rather sizable and numerous flaws. Mostly relating around achievement glitches, game crashing and multiplayer bugs.\nAchievement glitches are fairly frustrating, although are entirely not a concern unless you're as OCD as i am. The game progresses the same way regardless of steams registering of your progress.\nGame crashes for alot of players at certain intervals in the game, Which HAS caused loss of character saves. It's highly recommended that you cloud save your favorite character builds and worlds, so that your save data will always be present.\nAnd Multiplayer as a whole is a fairly awful experience, the above mention bugs as well as an assortment of new things, Players not seeing what each other are seeing, Enemies and bosses despawning because of numerous players involved, which may or may not potentially ruin hours upon hours of preparation and planning. Frustrating to say the least. But alot of it is avoidable if you take necessary precautions. Alot of which can be found through quick internet searches.\n\nOverall: This game is a gigantic time suck lol\nThere is no other way to put it, You will pour time into boss by boss progression, farming and grinding enemies for specific gear to better improve your chances at the next boss. You will dig deep into dirt, mud and ash for hours upon hours just to find 3 pieces of ore which isn't even close to the amount you need. You will kill thousands of enemies for a single piece of gear, that isn't even optimal till you find another piece it can be fused with. You will die on the inside for days and potentially weeks as you farm your way to the very end of the game. And then when it's all over and you finally can get a breath of respite as your real life world is crumbling to pieces around you, You will feel empty, knowing that it's done.\nThis game isn't just worth its price, It's worth every minute you pour into it.\nWelcome to Terraria.

I can imagine many critics have started Terraria, played for some hours trying to figure it out, and put it away. Very often, critics have drawn misguided conclusions that Terraria resembles Minecraft (or is a Minecraft clone), but in fact nothing could be further from the truth. Terraria is a procedurally generated sandbox survival metroidvania. Learning curve is steep, the game is hard and often requires you to consult to wikis and guides (even more so than the Souls series) but once you gain control of the game mechanics, you will find a very deep, hard core gem. Don\u2019t let its eye-candy graphics fool you\u2026\n\nYou are dropped into a world surrounded by many dangers. Initially, you are expected to make your first shelter, first weapon and just survive. This is the very core of the whole game. In order to beat stronger creatures, you need better weapons for which you need better crafting material. To get better crafting material, you need to mine deep into the earth, which leads you to find secret chests, face gazillion creatures including \u201cbosses\u201d. Boss fights not only require skill, but also need you to have the weapons, armors, potions, items necessary to beat them. Last, but not the least, there are plenty of events such as Halloween, Christmas, Pirate Invasion etc. with their own unique bosses and loots.\n\nWhile you are working on mining for better tools, armors, weapons to be able to beat stronger enemies, you also need to keep expanding your \u201cshelter\u201d. A chair, ceiling and door is not sufficient any longer. You need to keep building new rooms to have room for new crafting centers and chests (for inventory). Every new room invites a new NPC to your shelter who can be crucial in your quest to beat the world of terraria, whether they sell unique items or provide healing.\n\nBeing a true sandbox game, you can also ignore progression and spend hundreds of hours just building. Your limit to what you can build and how you can customize it is your imagination. People at Terraria subreddit still manage to amaze me with their creativity and sometimes totally mind-blowing architecture. \n\nWhether you choose to play it as a metroidvania or as a sandbox 2d Minecraft, you will love Terraria. In my opinion, it is one of the best games ever made.\n\n[b]PS:[/b] Buy it full price.

You cannot really compare these games together, because to me, Terraria is a dungeon-crawler. You are meant to find good weapons, kill enemies and bosses, and mining is secondary. This is strengthened by the amount of unique enemies, bosses, accessories, weapons, and the likes. Terraria is a game that I [b]can recommend to anyone who enjoys dungeon crawlers.[/b] The combat isn't difficult, and I honestly like it. There's great music, amazing biome diversity, building is fun, enemies are just as fun and unique, bosses are hard to kill without taking a decent amount of damage. There are hooks, wings, pets, and way more that are unique.\n\n[url=https://steamdb.info/app/105600/]You can view more information on the prices, playercount, and other information here.[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1521396577, "timestamp_updated": 1521671187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 173, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.907756209373474121", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48501186": {"recommendationid": "48501186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294018801", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 31340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1258, "last_played": 1551425006}, "language": "english", "review": "I miss my wife and kids", "timestamp_created": 1548231855, "timestamp_updated": 1548231855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 373, "votes_funny": 859, "weighted_vote_score": "0.913486719131469727", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16940388": {"recommendationid": "16940388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086162912", "num_games_owned": 910, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 11718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547968612}, "language": "english", "review": "You can be a werewolf riding a unicorn while shooting rainbows from a gun.

In the beginning, you're pretty much helpless, killing the weakest enemies in multiple hits. You move slugglishly, and minor heights and caverns are truly intimidating. In the end, you are a force to be reckoned with, capable of taking down hoards of enemy after enemy mithout even pressing a button - diving to the deepest parts of the world and traversing every terrain with ease. \nThe change is gradual, and each challenge is tougher than the last.

You can have over 1,000 hours in this game and still be surprised. The amount of content is frankly ASTOUNDING. The complexity, depth, and sheer magnitude of this game blows my mind every time I play it. There isn't a story, but there is clearly lore to uncover. You'll mostly be mining, fighting, building, and testing your creativity with different combinations of weapons and movement systems. There are many different types of armor which allow you to move in many different ways, which allows you to enhance your combat abilities against different enemies and just traverse the land / explore more easily. There are 83 different wearable movement items, to be exact.... \n\nJust kidding, that's JUST THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WINGS. AND WINGS AREN'T EVEN THE ONLY ITEMS THAT ENABLE YOU TO FLY. \n\nThere's rocket boots, hoverboards, rideable animals, space ships... Magical staffs, bows, swords, axes, rifles, fucking machine guns, etc. The list of movement & combat items goes on forever, There are SO many different enemies, interesting bosses, and ways to fight them. The ONLY people in the world who won't enjoy this game are people who don't enjoy mining/exploring, or people who just hate platformers regardless of how good they are. If you're not one of those people, buy this game.\n\nI was confused when I first played, so here's my TLDR run-down of the game if you don't understand what the goal is (Assuming you're starting in a new world with a fresh character):\nStart with a few basic tools, build yourself a house (preferably multiple houses) which, once certain requirements are met, NPCs will move into. These NPCs will offer you different benefits and sell you interesting items, some of which are exclusive to them. The bosses in the world can either be summoned with different items, or will spawn in front of you once certain requirements are met. You want to beat the bosses for mainly 2 reasons: They drop amazing items, and/or they allow you to get certain new NPCs to move into your house. For example, defeating the Queen Bee will cause the Witch Doctor NPC to move into your house, who will sell you a great pair of Wings when you put him in a Jungle biome at night (yes, the Wiki is your best friend). So the goal of the game is to keep getting better metals/materials to make yourself better weapons/armor so you can beat stronger enemies/bosses so you can keep getting better metals/materials and so on. Once you beat the Wall of Flesh boss (which you have to summon in the Underworld by throwing a Voodoo Doll into a pit of lava), your entire world - including most enemies and metal ores - will change to Hardmode, and you'll pretty much feel like you're starting over again because enemies will once again be able to kick your ass and more bosses will become available to fight and more items will become available to craft. \n\nThat's just the surface level of the game, but that's the best general explanation I can give for people who are still like \"wtf is this game, what is my goal, what do I do\" because that's how I felt when I first played.\n\nIf you want a great explanation of why I love this game in video format, check out \"Terraria - Best video game ever made\" on YouTube by Maj0rLee. I'm not affiliated with him, it's just a great video about the game if you're still on the fence. \n\n\nP.S.

You could be preparing a Bowl of Soup in your new kitchen when all of a sudden an army of Goblins invade from the West. And you were not geared! They might end up killing Isis, the Party Girl, and you kinda had a thing for her, but that's okay, that's just a game.

You will face pretty challenging bosses, which will throw you in the search for more powerful gear to defeat him.\n\nAnd after you done it all, you'll realize that Crimson Blocks are much cooler than the blocks you used to build your main Quarter in your Base.

Pets are like mounts but useless. they still get dropped by enemies and bosses, but sometimes chests have them too.\n\nEvents:\nSometimes at night or day in terraria you will get a text saying something like \"You feel an evil presence watching you.\". well that's an event people. an event in terraria is when the game decides to throw obstacles and mountains of enemies at you. they do provide some good loot sometimes though. or summon bosses.\n\nMultiplayer:\nMultiplayer it like it sounds, multiple people in one game. the multiplayer has a few features. like teams (so you can fight to the death) more people to help you kill things or build...and that's actually it.\n\nExpert Mode:\nExpert Mode is basically just the entire game...but everything can kill you easily. there are more rewards though. bosses give special items now. sometimes you can get developer sets to show off to your friends and you die more! you should probably play the game a bit before using this mode.\n\nHard Mode:\nSo after you kill a boss (not saying it) the game will put you in hardmode. basically adding new enemies, ores and making every pre-hard mode enemy stronger, i recommend getting really good armor, gear, and weapons before advancing to this mode (because if you kill the boss you dont have a choice)\n\n\nClasses:\nClasses are basically just 4 different types and they basically say what they are. \"warrior\" using melee weapons and being tanky, \"ranger\" using mostly guns, bows, and crossbows, \"mage\" using magic weapons to incinerate, freeze, or poison your foes, and finally \"summoner\" it's pretty much the mage class but you summon stuff to help destroy enemies. pick the one that suits you.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion if you have some christmas cash or something then i recommend getting this game, if you can deal with the occasional hard parts of the game. this game is probably for you, the game isn't too hard and has a wide variety of things to do in it, if it's killing things for a collection, beating every boss, building really good houses, or making a successful server, the game has things for you to do, i personally recommend this game and you should get it.", "timestamp_created": 1547687524, "timestamp_updated": 1547687524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 95, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.877044916152954102", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31682195": {"recommendationid": "31682195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175625815", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 85730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548962787}, "language": "english", "review": "1000 hours of my life wasted on this game.

I would like to apologize for anything that is miss-spelled or any grammar issues. Thank you.\nIf you'd like to skip straight to Pro's & Con's, please move to the bottom of the page. Thank you.\n\n[b]UPDATED EDIT 7/6/2015:[/b] With the release of Update 1.3, Terraria has become three hundred times better. Update 1.3 adds in loads of new items, monsters, bosses, events, and more. The new bosses are a really big challenge and very cleverly done. The addition of achievements is addicting to any player who loves to hunt achievements, like myself. Including the new gamemode known as \"Expert Mode\" which is basically like turning the difficulty up to 'brutal'. Lots of other changes as well, like new textures and sounds, and the new addition of world stats to keep track of how many of each type of monster you kill (Which now rewards you with banners). \n\n[h1]How I Found Out About \"Terraria\"[/h1]\nI found out about Terraria the same way I use to always find games, YouTube. I randomly came across a video called \"Terraria\". I took a look, and instantly fell in love with what I saw, and knew I had to have the game for myself. It looked like a great combination of gerne' that I love to bits. Being a Minecraft fan since the beggining of Alpha, I knew I [b]MUST[/b] have it.\n\n[h1]Unfair First Impressions[/h1]\nWhen ever you ask someone about Terraria, read a review, or watch a video, 95% of the time you hear \"Minecraft clone\" or \"2D Minecraft\". Which is incorrect on so many levels. If you have heard this many times, and are thinking twice about actually playing Terraria, please read on as it is nothing like Minecraft. \n\n[h1]Review Of Terraria[/h1] \nTerraria is a very unique game for what it does. There have been games like it in the past, but the amount of content and play ability is beyond anything I've ever seen before. \n\nTerraria is a [b]sandbox[/b], [b]RPG[/b], [b]action[/b], etc. 2D game. It does it's thing very well. I haven't noticed any UI bugs, or ones that I have, are fixed almost instantly after the patch is released. The gameplay it provides is not only smooth, it is addicting and fun. The combat system in the game is perfect for me, and a lot of others. There are so many enemy types in this game that are not copy paste, each one [b]does their own thing[/b] and has [b]their own weaknesses & strength's[/b] \n\nExample on the kind of enemies you could come across. \nNormal walking/running enemies, that have a soul objective to charge you until death. These may include enemies like the [b]zombie[/b] or [b]skeleton[/b].\nAs there are other enemies who will do the same thing, but in a different way (So not everything is copy/paste.). Like the [b]slime[/b] enemy type, which come in many varieties, which will bounce towards you. Or the [b]spider[/b] enemy type, which will walk on the ground, but can also climb on the walls to get to you quicker. Just to name a few.\n\n\"Well, how do I defend myself against these enemies?\"\nGood question. Let's get that.\n\n[h1]Items & Furniture[/h1]\nThis is where Terraria gets big. Even though the world's are limited, they provide so much that you could spend 800 hours of game time on a single [i]small world[/i] and still have many things to do.\n\nIn the world of Terraria, there are alternate versions of almost everything. What I mean by this is, each world you have will not be the same. For example, there is a 50/50 chance when loading a world to have the default version of something, or the alternate. Such as the music that plays, there are different tracks for the same biomes, just depends on what random one you got. Or for textures on things like, grass, and trees. Also things like ore, in a default world you would have Copper as your basic ore, but in an alternate world, you'd have Tin as your basic ore. What this does is really expands the play time someone can spend in Terraria. Allowing a single person to play the game over and over, and never have the same experience. \n\nBelow the surface are loads of blocks, dirts, ores, and more. Ore like Copper, Tin, Lead, Iron, Silver, Platinum, Gold, Cobalt, etc. And blocks like normal dirt, clay, stone, mud, cobwebs, and so many more. You need these ores to make your weapons and armor. You can find treasure deep underground, that holds many valuable things. You can increase your maximum health by finding [b]Life Crystals[/b] underground.\n\nThe weapon range in this game is massive. You even have magic weapons, like spell books, and mana weapons. There are also bows, swords, pickaxes, axes, guns, lazers, cannons, familiars, and so much more.\n\nI won't get into to much detail here, but the amount of content in this game is massive, and it's still being updated. Sure, Terraria has been through some rough times with updates, but when it gets an update, the update is full of new things and changes. \n\n[h1]Pro's & Con's (Overall Rating)[/h1]\nOverall, Terraria is a great game that you can spend hours of time in, and still be having fun in many years to come. It's a steal for the price of $9.99, and especially when there is a sale that lowers the game to $2.00 or less. This game is definitely a choice for sandbox gamers looking for an easy to slip into, addicting experience. \n\nPro's:\n+Loads of content for hours of game time.\n+Great combat system.\n+Smooth gameplay, that's easy to slip into.\n+Provides a good challenge.\n+Fun and creative boss battles.\n+Amazing side events that you cannot resist.\n+Achievements are addicting to those achievement hunters.\n+Expert & Hardcore modes add hundreds more hours of gameplay and possibility.\n\nCon's:\n-No infinite world option. (Doesn't drop overall score - But can be annoying to some players)\n-No easy way to edit worlds before creation (Like choosing whether to have Crimson or Corruption)\n\nOverall Rating: Is about a 14.5/15 (Must Own!)\n\n[h1]Credits & Disclaimer[/h1]\nThank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope this helped out with your decision on whether to make a purchase or not.\n\nRemember, this review is based off of opinion only.

It looked like a minecraft ripoff in a 2D world.\nThe large amount of positive reviews and the low prive (4.99 euro at that time) convinced me to give this a try.\n\nI could not have been more wrong. This game is awesome !\nThe amount of content, the freedom, the difficulty level, the items and achievements you can collect, all of this make it one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nYou can:\n      1 Create large buildings\n      2 Collect loads of items, weapons and armor\n      3 Explore a huge map\n      4 Become a badass warrior and defeat enormous bosses\n      5 ...\n\nOne thing I really like is what changes if you play on the highest difficulty level.\nOfcours everything gets a lot harder, but you are also able to get better and more drops (items) from enemies.\nThis feels like the game is rewarding you for playing on a higher difficulty.\n\nThere is even a multiplayer aspect, which makes it even better. It is really fun to play with friends.\n\nGraphics : 8/10\nNot too impressive, a 2D world map. The graphics itself are outdated but create the perfect atmosphere for this game.\nYou can create 2 types of worlds, which each have a different dark environment.\nMultiple biomes (forest, jungle, desert, ...) exist, with its own unique enemies and environment.\n\nOptimization : 9/10\nGood optimization, 60 fps on 1440p-max on a gtx 980 (overclocked) with v-sync on.\nWithout v-sync, the fps went up to a stable 165 fps, but for some reason playing on 60 fps is more enjoyable.\n\nStory : 2/10\nThis is where the game is lacking at the moment. Actually no story exists, you are free to create your own :)\n\nLength : 10/10\nI killed the final boss after 125 hours on the highest difficulty. This is awesome for a game where I payed 4.99 for.\nThe game is not finished though. I can still perfect my house, kill other bosses, collect items, explore some more...\n\nI have around 180 games in my steam library, after 2 weeks this game is in the top 3 of most played games.\nEnough said.\n\nReplayablity : 10/10\nEach world you create, is unique because they are created based upon a \"seed\".\nAs stated above, each world has its unique dark environment. The type is selected upon world creation.\nThere are [spoiler]21[/spoiler] different type of ores, but each world will only contain [spoiler]13[/spoiler].\nThis means each world will play differently and you need to create a lot of worlds to be able to collect all the items in the game.\n\nBecause of this you will never be able to see al the content and achievements on your first playthrough.", "timestamp_created": 1506251529, "timestamp_updated": 1506251703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 86, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.865700066089630127", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42592070": {"recommendationid": "42592070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065116861", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 81156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 447, "last_played": 1551409533}, "language": "english", "review": "Terraria looks like your typical sandbox crafting game. And it might've been that in the early patches. But after the Hardmode update everything changed. In my opinion that's when Terraria became its own game. It feels like an RPG, with rare loot, bosses and classes, but with a twist which would be the crafting and base-building. It's way more complex than it looks, and at the same time it's really accessible. You can play it very casually or go deeper (for example checking wiki for droprates on X item, best prefixes for weapon, mechanics on world spawning, etc). \n\nIt has everything you need for a great adventure game, tons of items, weapons and enemies, and unique bosses with different AIs. And if you think the game is too easy there's Expert mode (which in my opinion, it's the way the game is meant to be experienced). Hardcore runs are also a thing but keep in mind it's really hard to play with no deaths (looking at you boulder traps). You finished the game and want more content? Worry not, there's Mod support (really easy to get into, just search tModloader on google and after you install it there's a mod browser in game). Finally, multiplayer mode. Terraria is a great solo game but even better multiplayer. Since there's multiple classes, you can make a party with your friends and share items that don't fit your class, explore together, farm bosses, etc.\n\nOverall, Terraria is a great sandbox adventure game, with a lot of replayability, specially with mods (Calamity, Thorium and Fargo's are my personal favorites). The game is still being updated to this day (currently June 2018) which show the devs really care about their game. The only con I can think about is that the early game is kinda slow.

My impression prior to buying it was that it was a 2D minecraft clone, but after playing it, I prefer it to minecraft. But comparing to minecraft, as is often done, doesn't seem very fair to me, because they are two very different experiences. Terraria can be played in many different ways, and I'd expect that most people can find a way to enjoy it. Whether you prefer to take it slowly and cautiously, farming herbs and brewing potions, or prefer to role the dice, diving through caves and looting randomly generated structures, Terraria can be about exploration, collection, boss fighting, base defending, and much more. \n\nYou start out by creating a character. The customization is limited, but not too limited. You can have multiple characters, and you can skip this by randomizing or choosing the default skin, but it doesn't take very long. You can then create a world (or multiple), choosing between normal and expert mode (as its name suggests, expert mode is not forgiving to newer players). The world has many different regions to explore, each with their own dangers and treasures. Between islands in the sky, a bug-infested jungle, a terrifying evil (which begins to spread later, there are two variants), and much more, you probably won't be bored by it for some time.\n\nThe game has many mechanics to make it interesting. You can start a town of NPCs and complete quests for them or buy goods from them. You can fish up a meal or some treasure. You can acquire tools which you can use to wire up traps or farms. There are many events the player can defend against of varying difficulties throughout the game, and even more bosses to fight. There are literally thousands of different items and accessories to customize your playstyle; although there are only four main classes to choose from for the majority of the game, these being mage, ranged weaponist, mele fighter, and summoner (although summoner items are usually more difficult to obtain).\n\nI personally have put in almost a thousand hours, but I don't believe you need to put in even ten hours to get your money's worth.

Building/crafting is intuitive and fast albeit 2d, and the game makes for a very fun co-op experience if you have friends to play with.\n\nAt its price bracket, the value for time spent is phenomenal if you like the idea of a 2d sandbox platformer with boss fights and the excitement of the next loot drop. Difficulty scales nicely (and has an \"expert\" mode for those that find the default game a bit easy), World size is variable, and the penalty on dying can be chosen from \"drop some money and nothing else\" to \"your character is dead, please start again\".\n\nOne of the nicest features of Terraria is the ability to have characters and worlds that aren't tied to each other. So if you're looking for a specific item that doesn't seem to be on your world, you can just generate a new one, take your character there to farm for items, and then go back to your main world - or you can start a brand new character on a world you've already built up with NPCs and everything else rather than needing to completely start from scratch each time - not many games have managed to pull this off so well.\n\nThe game is also very kid friendly, and has been a fun family multiplayer game in this house many times over.\n\nSummary\n\nExcellent 2D platformer with crafting, boss fights, huge amounts of content from aesthetics to rare items and godly weapons, the ability to continually improve your character over hours of play, and well designed procedurally generated levels.

A nice feature to note is that you can have your character travel through multiple worlds while keeping their items. You will be thrust into a new world where you will have to gather resources and upgrade your arsenal. Night in Terraria is not as forgiving as Minecraft. After you survive you will continue to build up your personal collection while building a house. You will build a house so that random people can move in take up a room and rip you off with prices (jk not all prices are bad). Eventually you shall fight your first boss and bosses in Terraria will give you a run for your money so you better be prepared guys and gals. \n\n[h1] Singleplayer/Multiplayer\t[/h1]\n\nTerraria is a fun game and even more fun with friends. Friends will help you out and make it easier to advance without dying.... too much :D. However if you do not feel like playing multiplayer singleplayer is just as fun. In single player you do not have to share your loot and your friends are incapable of stealing it, because it is singlepalyer.\n\n[h1]  Hardmode\t[/h1]\n\nHardmode is a gamemode that Terraria automatically places you in after you beat The Wall of Flesh.

I met a lot of people and learned so many things through these friendships and communities and practically gone through what seems like the virtual equivalent to my childhood, so wow does this game have a special place in my heart.\n\nPutting my sentimental values in this game aside, content-wise this game is practically everything a fantasy-loving, retro game, sandbox, adventurous and architectually creative enthusiast could ever ask for (see if you're not a fan of any of those kind of games, then you probably might not enjoy this considering the beginning is rather.. slow). Gosh there's just so much to love in this game that I don't even know where to begin, that is, if you give this game a chance. I shall warn anyone who isn't a fan of reading guides that the game in the beginning isn't very intuitive, as it just throws you in the world with no tutorial whatsoever.
