Sadly, in the last 2 years or so, it has died. This is not only due to the events following the remake of the combat system, but also the community just filling with toxicity and people who used to love this game, that are now just full of hate for it due to changes made by the devs. H1Z1 King of the Kill, and Just Survive from 2016-2017 may very well be some of my favorite games of all time period, but currently, both are not even playable in my opinion. Aside from the changes made to the games, both lack even a player-base at this point. H1 I love you, but you just don't have what we as a community used to love. Proximity chat, and the high intensity battles that used to follow a whole lotta smack talkin, was swindled down into a game where the only people who play are either extremely good at the game, making it unbearable for new players, especially at the time it became free-to-play, and or hackers from completely different countries than their relative servers. H1 will always have a special place in my heart, along with daybreak as a studio, but If something isn't done soon, this game can, and very well could go under, rendering all the memories I made across this extremely innovative world of H1Z1, completely unrelatable to anyone who was not playing this game from I want to say 2016- mid 2017. If anyone at daybreak reads this, and you guys want to take a new creative direction, which you need to, then find someone from your playerbase, take them in, and have them decide what to do with this title that is completely falling apart. In the end H1 had it's time, It was, and always will be amazing for what it did to the Battle Royale genre, but it is no longer relevant, I hope daybreak finds a way to bring H1 back to where it once was, and in my opinion to where it belongs.\n\nThank You,\nSir TerZ", "timestamp_created": 1550619557, "timestamp_updated": 1550619557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646934449672698975", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49203929": {"recommendationid": "49203929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095111836", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507932169}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty upset that i purchased this game way back in 2015 to play a SURVIVAL game. They then offered battle royal and gave us a separate game called \"just survive\" as sort of the PVE. But then the survival game which i wanted in the first place has been brought down and they didnt leave us even a local PvE game they just made it useless and made the game unplayable. so they put everything into \"h1z1\" which has just turned into the Free to Play PC PUBG which is a kick in the nuts because i paid for a survival game with crafting and building and im left with a pubg clone that everyone else got for free. On this principle alone i purchased pubg after a few rounds of seeing what this game turned into and i have not played it since. It felt wonky and even more unpolished than PUBG (and im talking about over a year ago) and large engagements with multiple enemies would always get choppy on me no matter how good my internet and ping was. They may have made it better over the past year being the free PUBG but i am just too in the lack of support the original game received and nothing was given to the people that actually paid for the game.

This game was once fun a full of promise so I have no problem with the fact that I paid full price for it. You see, that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to go. Early access is a kind of a system where gamers support a clearly unfinished product out of the love for games and the developers in turn honor that support by trying to use those funds to better the product as well as they possibly can.\n\nThis is not what happened with H1Z1.\n\nDaybreak noticed way too early that pushing out ridiculous amounts of items gave them a nice extra revenue, not only from crate/key sales but also from gamers juggling those items back and forth at the marketplace (yes, they get a cut).\nThe shift from building an interesting game to building a moneymaking machine was clear as day. Instead of bettering the game, updates concentrated on how to get more players to play \u2192 buy crates \u2192 buy and sell items. The lack of love is so apparent in the development of this game that it leaves me and all my friends wondering if the developers are actually gamers themselves at all.\n\nI got this game very soon after the launch and played regularly over the years. I watched a fun functional game turn into a monotonic mess. \nLet\u2019s look at the changes / functions closer:\n\nNormal Battle Royale:\n- When the game first got out, it had a good interesting map with a lot of foliage and natural formations. This allowed players to have more than one strategy. This is the only time when the items they sold were useful because you could actually take advantage of things like camo. Soon the developers cut the map\u2019s size, removed almost all the interesting places and pretty much all the foliage. This was no doubt a way to cater to an audience with cheaper computers. The end result is horrible: nothing but open level fields without foliage or even rocks to take cover behind. In a way it looks like a 12 year old\u2019s first attempt at making a map in Unity using nothing but free store assets. The map looks unprofessional and is boring to play in.\n- Let\u2019s mention this again. There is only 1 map.\n- Guns used to feel steady. Now the recoil is like everyone is missing an arm. As someone who has handled multiple different firearms in her life I can tell that it doesn\u2019t work like this.\n- The original way of fighting but also having to worry about the location of the safe zone was more interesting and actually required some brains to do. Now they added all sorts of ease-of-access map markers to make sure anyone with 50IQ or less can just spawn into the safe zone and pew pew pew / repeat.\n- There\u2019s only one way to play. Because of the emptiness of the map and the safe zone always concentrating on an open level field, the only way to survive is to get a car and keep moving. On foot you never have a place to hide behind and end up being shot down in seconds by someone with a car. This wasn\u2019t the case before, using a car was only one of the multiple ways you could approach winning the match.\n- Cheaters. This problem got a lot worse after the game went ftp.\n- Desync.\n- Annoying things like grenade blasts and gas grenade gas passing walls / floors.\n- Again, cars. They used to be rare. This was nice because it forced people to play in more than just one way. Now cars are literally everywhere, it takes less than a minute for a 5-person team to have a vehicle for every person.\n- People don\u2019t play. Trying to play fives after 1AM in EU is borderline impossible because the lobby has less than 5 teams.\n\nCar Royale:\nNote that this would be a really fun mode if it actually worked.\n\n- Desync.\n- Getting stuck on walls / railings.\n- Duos never available.\n- Takes forever to start a match.\n- Impossible to start a match after 1AM due to no-one playing this game.\n- A griefer\u2019s heaven. Why? There is no vote kick or any way to lock a spot on your team. If you have the misfortune to not actually have 4 people available to play, you are at the mercy of the 1 random person who gets matched with your team forcibly. This one person has a multitude of ways to screw over the team: stealing all healing items, using molotovs to set your own team\u2019s car on fire, using grenades to hurt your own team\u2019s car, using mines to hurt your own team, using the crossbow or the rpg to hurt your own team or (and this is the best part) getting angry over not getting a special weapon like the crossbow and taking the ammo into his own inventory even if someone else has the crossbow. Note that the person who actually has the weapon cannot take the ammo into their own inventory and use it, only the ones without the weapon can take it and make it unavailable for the person who has it. If the randomer ends up as the driver he has plenty of new ways to troll. These people are more common than you\u2019d think and seem to be playing this mode solely for this purpose.\n- The unwinnable match. If you play 10 matches, about 3-4 out of those matches are unwinnable by default. Not because of the skill of your team but because of the system not registering the destruction of a team if they have a 2000ping ftp player connecting while they died. This leads to you being alone in the safe zone with no-one to kill, yet the system says there is still one person/team alive besides you.\n- The 2000 ping players. Again, there is no vote kick or any way to get this person off your team. If you play with 2 friends 8 times out of 10 your last team mate is this person. Why is it a problem then? I\u2019ll tell you. After you spawn, you need to change the driver if your team has a person that always drives. But if someone is still connecting, you cannot change the seats. Odds are you end up driving around half the match with the randomer still connecting. Again one of those awesome things brought to us by making the game ftp.\n- The quality of the player base. I didn\u2019t mention this on the normal Battle Royale because it\u2019s not a bother there but in Car Royale it is. Team games are a great way to meet new gamers like yourself, make friends and hone your teamwork skills. This game has nothing but ftp players left. This means people without steam profiles, microphones, teamwork skills or even the ability to connect into the match.\n\nThe game has been going downhill for a long time due to many of the reasons I\u2019ve stated above and people have spoken out. Just look at the reviews (even before the game went ftp).\nAnd how does Daybreak answer the gamers? By reverting back to the old map? No. By changing the shooting mechanics back to how they used to be? No. \nThey answer by releasing more items. And crates. And hoodies that cost 16 euros. And Weapon skins that cost 10 euros. \n\nDaybreak will never get another cent from me. \nDisrespecting your own game and your player base like this is like disrespecting the entire gamer culture. Gamers can see when a developer develops for the money and not for the love of the game. And this is why this game is dead.

Hell yeah!\n\n[b]Updates that didn't bring anything good to the game, fuck yea...wait, what?\n\nAnyway, couple months later, the unoptimized, cosmetic filled, money grabbing H1Z1 is announced to go out of early access, aiming at a very good perspective for the future of the game, with constant support and updates from the developers.[/b]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/games/433850/announcements/detail/1673522637761530036\n\n[h1]This release was last week[/h1]\n\n[b]One week later (yesterday), what I will consider as an \"emergency announcement\" is given by Daybreak:\n\n\"Guys, H1Z1 is out and our future perspectives dictate that F2P is the way to go. Sorry for the buyers of the fully functional release, you can refund according to steam's refund policy\"[/b]\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/games/433850/announcements/detail/1675775070302263191\n\nSo get this shit: The game is out and gets a huge publicity stunt, facebook, media articles, steam banners, etc. It's out! People will buy it more since there is alot of people who only buy the game upon release, Daybreak got a very likely boost in sales. Logic dictates one plays the game once it's bought, and according to steam's refund policy: if you exceed 2 hours of steam play time... the refund is no longer eligible.\n\n[b]Do you see where I'm going with this? [/b]\n\nSo they release this (still) unoptimized, broken and ALPHA-STATE WORTHY game and day 7 release the Free to Play announcement and make it F2P THE DAY IT'S ANNOUNCED!! And people who bought it during this week and played little over 2 hours (which is about 4 matches) can't refund it. Excellent!!\n\n[h1]\"Well, I'm sure the compensation for people who bought it is rewarding enough, especially those who were with the game since it's very birth (3 FUCKING YEARS AGO)\"[/h1]\n\n[b]We (I mean every buyer with \"We\") got a hat, a shirt (not even good ones), a car camo, 10 of the newest crates (and if you get good valuable items to sell and try to refund your game through this \"plan B\",  you can't sell them cuz...  unmarketable) and 10K skulls (a currency) which allows you to buy about... nothing.[/b]\n\nOne dev said in the community hub \"Hey - we can't control your luck of the day, but at least you have a few other free skins to enjoy!\"\nPeople must feel so happy they paid 20\u20ac for the final product of their game to be this. Some free skins. Yay.\nOh and I mentioned the 10K skulls. So get this, with those skulls, you can buy: about a mix of 3-5 clothing pieces depending on which ones you buy, a car camo or an unlocked crate + 1 skin.\n\nWow, so much value. So much appreciation for all the support, love and suggestions we gave you throughout the game's lifespan, Daybreak.\n\n[b]So the grave was set, the nails were locked, they just needed to drop the hammer. F2P dropped the hammer. You compensated your loyal playerbase with fuck-all. You gave F2P users a broken game that barely runs, not even my GTX1060 can run this at 60 FPS at all times. AutoRoyale (their \"innovative\" mode which is essentially the same but locked inside a car) doesn't even hit 60FPS at all.\n(And before you argue bottleneck I have an i7 7700k)[/b]\n\nAnd don't forget. What would F2P users play? A game that is in absolute no way better than Fortnite for the same price... or Fortnite? We get a pistol, 2 AR's, a shotgun, a sniper, an SMG and 2 bows. Some weapons were even removed! Other BR's can get upwards of 15+ weapons!!\n\n[h1]\nBut wait![/h1]\n\nYou can reward yourself with the Edition Packs! Bronze, Silver and Gold all give skins and crates for you to open and get your mass supply of cool skins!\nEXCEPT THE PACKS ARE 20, 45 and 93 (NINETY FUCKING THREE) EUROS!!!\n[spoiler]\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/820442/H1Z1_Gold_LIMITED_EDITION_Battle_Royale_Pack/\n\n[b]LOOK AT THIS BULLSHIT, WOULD YOU PAY 93 EUROS FOR THIS? [/b]\n[h1]You can get Witcher 3 COMPLETE GOTY EDITION + Fallout 4 GOTY EDITION FOR THE SAME PRICE. You can buy 3 copies of PUBG for this price!!!!![/h1] [/spoiler]\n\n[h1]EDIT: these packs were misteriously removed out of nowhere from the stores. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af[/h1]\n\n\nAnd before you insult me for being a self entitled fuck wanting a refund... \n[h1]I don't want a refund, never did and never will. I can't get anyways, but it's been so long since I bought it, I kind of don't care anymore.[/h1]\n\nI payed 50,99\u20ac for BRINK back in 2011 ON RELEASE. And I DEFENDED it's F2P model introduced in 2017. 6 years vs. 3 years. It honestly doesn't matter. BRINK is a full game. You get the story, multiplayer and skins all for free through the standard play everyone did back in 2011. The DLC's existed since 2012 and are cheap cosmetic aside from Agents of Change.\n\nBut this... this... there is no middle finger big enough from Daybreak to consumers and from us to them as well. All aboard the big middle finger convention!\n\n[b] So, what do you want, then? [/b]\n\n[h1]Not another single soul give this game a try, or even dare to buy a single skin from this game, at all, AT ALL. And for the rest of playerbase let this die by leaving and playing shit that is actually worth playing, like Fortnite and, even if totally fucked up in it's full release, PUBG (which is still miles away better).[/h1]\n\nI won't do the usual Pros and Cons bullshit, all pros this has are present in PUBG and Fortnite as well. All cons... PUBG and Fortnite have about 20% of such cons, if that many at all.\n\nA cashgrab through and through, the biggest slap in the face of the year and that I ever got. I've seen shady shit, but this level is astronomic, not even Aliens: Colonial Marines, Rome 2, BRINK were this fucked up.\n\nDon't even dare download this, just don't.

This game used to be fun, amazingly fun infact. The hit reg was bearable, the guns felt great and the lighting was great. H1Z1 was the #1 battle royale game for quite sometime.\n\nThis games worst enemy is its own developers, Daybreak games have ruined what this great game once was. With the additon of the combat update, the gun play and recoil was drasitcally changed for its core guns which left a lot of veteran players infuriated. To give a clear analogy to how bad this recoil change was:\n\nCounter Strike (starting from 1.6) has had a VERY similar if not the exact same recoil pattern for the AK-47 for more than a decade and a half. All the core players have got this on lock giving the game a much higher skill gap. Imagine if Valve suddenly decided to completely change the AK-47 spray pattern with no logical reasoning? The outrage would be immense. \n\nDaybreak are trying to re invent this game into something that it shouldnt be. It should be what the players want not what the developers want. The players have been screaming to the devs to revert back to the build of a previous season where the game was at its peak, but they dont listen. They say they wont do it and they dont provide any logical reasoning. \n\nNow the gunplay is horrid, shotgun is broken, ENAS has plauged the play style and there is little to no skill gap in the game. \n\nI really do want this game to prosper and go back to that beautiful game that it once was, but I sadly and firmly believe that it wont ever get close to what it once was purely because of the developers. If you want proof as to why I believe this, have a look at the Steam Charts and the H1Z1 Subreddit. \n\nPUBG did not kill H1Z1, Fortnite did not kill H1Z1, the players did not kill H1Z1.\n\n[b]Daybreak Games killed H1Z1.[/b]\n\nAnd it will never be great again.", "timestamp_created": 1511650075, "timestamp_updated": 1513386101, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1921, "votes_funny": 98, "weighted_vote_score": "0.919193148612976074", "comment_count": 107, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40794875": {"recommendationid": "40794875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084105050", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1521559660}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy game for 20$.\n(Next Day)\nH1Z1 Is now F2P.\nTF..", "timestamp_created": 1520970609, "timestamp_updated": 1525003623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 795, "votes_funny": 1284, "weighted_vote_score": "0.925360381603240967", "comment_count": 52, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48244792": {"recommendationid": "48244792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016555200", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 204798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 61, "last_played": 1551841003}, "language": "english", "review": "after spending over 3k hours in this game and playing it over the course of many years, i have realised that the dev team consists of doing two things, mistakes, and more mistakes.\npreseason 3 had over 150k players and the game was fun, then they changed core mechanics of the game with the combat update and lost over 90% of their player base, after 2 years of waiting for the dev team to do something, remain consistent and make the game playable, not only have they made it worse every single update that has come out, but they are still, after 3 years, after taking it out of early access, after ignoring the commmunity again and again, countless times, \nthey are still, changing the core mechanics of the game, recoil, bullet drop, bullet speed etc.\nevery game you play there will be hackers, ruining your experience.\nand when there arent hackers, theres desync which is just as bad, crouch behind cover? \nnope still got shot because u peaked 3 seconds ago.\nwhat was once a fun and enjoyable gaming experience is now broken unplayable garbage. \nleave h1z1 how it should be, a memory.", "timestamp_created": 1547175012, "timestamp_updated": 1547175012, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 94, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.871948003768920898", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47946791": {"recommendationid": "47946791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318679846", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 123765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1544870024}, "language": "english", "review": "All good things come to an end.", "timestamp_created": 1546147837, "timestamp_updated": 1546147996, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 222, "votes_funny": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.897909283638000488", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48130127": {"recommendationid": "48130127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198351310537", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1542995337}, "language": "english", "review": "We Want King Of The Kill Back", "timestamp_created": 1546719010, "timestamp_updated": 1546719010, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 92, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.875016450881958008", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38309359": {"recommendationid": "38309359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020715100", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1521825442}, "language": "english", "review": "Once upon a time there was a not so bad battle royale game called H1Z1, there was some flaws but it was bearable cause the game was addictive.

Through here, we had another game were we can travel searching for loot and fandom, making Allies and enemies alike, and simply RDM. For me, it was a train away from the DayZ hype. Heck, before PUBG, it was DayZ VS H1Z1. And it's funny because they all branched from Arma, yet, H1Z1 for some reason stuck out, with their on...Battle-Royal. This would take place in Z1 with over 150+ players. It was 'INSANE'. Jumping over peers, Dolphin Diving, Two bullets to kill, and \"Shotgun rushing.\" These few elements kept people on their toes, unless they were getting shot under the car. This started my love for H1Z1. I would practice day and night trying to get high kills. I remember thinking 18 kills was legendary, until I discovered the insane channels like StormenTV, DrDisrespect, Ninja, And even good old LyndonFPS, it was clear to me...I had to get better. I'd practice when my friends were even off, rush everyone, tried copying these top tier gods. If Stormen would no scope someone from med-range I'd practice that, when Doc jumped over the enemies just to one-pump them I'd camp doors for days. When I discovered two-taps, I became a God! But of course things took a twist for the worst!\n\nH1Z1 decided to branch out, moving to a new reddit, and making H1Z1 into H1Z1: Kotk. Things started to change without question, losing half the animations that we became so familiar with, removing out-playable situations. Instead of being able to jump over people it like crazy it was nerfed for a more stiff yet set to the ground type character. The odd body removements I remember laughing at everytime I died were gone. And follow was Z2 replacing Z1. This started a whole war inside the H1Z1 community with people picking sides, some vouching for the new maps and others...not too sure. This caused people to beg for Z1, and with Just Survive being introduced it started a uproar for those veterns. However, Pre-season 2 and 3 felt like humble times. The color popped, there was such a shift in skill with the new map. And people began to try and master it all, with people landing in big cities to gear up and camp the roofs while try-hards played Need For Speed while honking their horns. People would either jump out full speed to land insane Two-taps or get one-pumped by a shotgun, roof campers shooting the survivers and window watchers popping out of apartments from left to right. I would remember the rage and joy when people would win in ridiculous ways. I remember I'd shoot someone 5 times with a shotgun and would lose to their one-pump and curse the heathens out of them all! I have even gotten a game ban due to ReShade not being able to be used. I didn't care. I would repurchase H1Z1 and make new friends, Recieve new skins, even able to win a Pig mask and sell it for an upgrade on my GPU. It was my love, my life. And it has failed not only me...but us.\n\nAs time proceed, we have gotten nothing but updates we didn't ask for, Hit-reg feeling more and more deluted, and players crying that their one pumper-runie didn't do it's job and ending up with them costing their life. We would take a shift into bullet drop changing, making people rage at the fact that they'll have to re-learn, and learn until they are sick of it all.\n\n[b]What followed next...is the down fall of H1Z1: Kotk[/b]\n\nWith their \"NEW COMBAT UPDATE!\" At this time, let us face it, PUBG was being hyped by streamers and created a path to a whole new experience. But why would I enjoy that? I remember the barbaric frame-rate and Potato loading buildings, and besides why would I'd like to play a game where after I get nothing but a pistol I get sniped in a mere second? Sticking with H1 was well worth it until this new Combat update. Concerns of the Old Ar-15 pattern being spammable was to be replace with a whole new model of an AR, Bullet drop, Recoil, Spread, and even the look of it was re-worked. The community felt a painful joy. It was all looking gorgeous on paper and by the next week, it was pushed to Test servers. This caused the depression of this game, some were positive while most knew this might be the end of H1Z1. Despite the New Ar, Ak, And new MP7, instead of doing what it was told it was doing the exact opposite! People would spam the Ar, the AK, And lets not forget the lazer, MP7. The game felt even more buggy, There was no bullet drop, barley leading, the Ar, even more spammable at a farther range. I remember spraying the AK and hitting unthinkable two taps. And the community wasn't just raged, but scared for the big changes coming to H1Z1...And it came. With different type of nerfs applied, and almost new everything with a crazy amount of POIs the game started to lose fandom. I remember seeing 9k playings being lost each month, this has started the decline.\n\nSeeing \"H1Z1: Kotk\" and \"H1Z1\" Becoming \"H1Z1\" and \"Just Survive\" started the death of the game.\n\nWith Just Survive having their own problem, H1Z1 originality has started to shift, even ideas of adding scopes, and silencers where brought up with the community shutting it down. With the new Combat Update pros has branched to different games such as PUBG, and later on Fortnite. H1Z1 losing it's hype and slowy dying, each update ruining the game, bringing the fandom to rage. Even though we wanted to try something new it has back fired, with every update being directed by the community being hated afterwards, the game kept digging it's own grave. With all the big names disappearing and H1Z1 searching for the next big update, it was clear to see the direction of this product. Players quitting monthly in persuit for better games, skins losing it's price, and even the China ban hit H1 with many more problems. With only a handful who would stay.\n\nYet, even when they started listening to us at the end, this started the \"Loop.\" DayBreak would add something to revert it back, The new Ar replaced with the old spray pattern with adjustments, Z1 being re-worked even they would refuse to ever bringing it back. Movement, like Jumping over people, or Instantly Proning being brought back, things we had which is now making a comeback too late. Why would the aspect of the game change if we'd get them back later on? It didn't make sense, and people saw that. With the progression questionable it was even time for even veterns to finally make their way to better titles.\n\nH1Z1 has finally plummeted, The game feels terrible, Movement is restricted, You have to gamble for hit-reg, and games sometime starting up with only 70 players. Waiting went from a few seconds to a few minutes. It was starting to feel deserted. The same faces each game and less of them daily. and with the last change to bullet drop and couldn't take it anymore. I've lost all the knowladge I've learned, the old me has vanished, and even new players would consider me as a noob. It was clear to see, that my time has come aswell.\n\nTurning back at the times I've spent hiding from teams, crafting make-shifts, and popping off helments, made me realize that I might never feel such a rush for action, such a thrill shift in gameplay, and the funny jolts that I'd spend with friends. It's very clear to me, DayBreak has pulled a Planetside 2 on me, This was the 2nd time I've felt such a big lost in such an odd community. The shifting of games isn't even just for me. I really can never feel the same compared to what I've gone through in Z1 and Z2. And I feel many have felt the same, we all held hope for the game to jump back just to see it fall down each leap, and with the current state being worked on just to meet the need of the now player base I cannot recommend this game. \n\n[b]I'd always have my saved videos...[/b]\n\n\n\n\n\n[spoiler]but will never have the same game in them.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1519202345, "timestamp_updated": 1519202345, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 984, "votes_funny": 51, "weighted_vote_score": "0.90254288911819458", "comment_count": 64, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21311538": {"recommendationid": "21311538", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974423702", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490138870}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Do not purchase this game.

This game was once fun a full of promise so I have no problem with the fact that I paid full price for it. You see, that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to go. Early access is a kind of a system where gamers support a clearly unfinished product out of the love for games and the developers in turn honor that support by trying to use those funds to better the product as well as they possibly can.\n\nThis is not what happened with H1Z1.\n\nDaybreak noticed way too early that pushing out ridiculous amounts of items gave them a nice extra revenue, not only from crate/key sales but also from gamers juggling those items back and forth at the marketplace (yes, they get a cut).\nThe shift from building an interesting game to building a moneymaking machine was clear as day. Instead of bettering the game, updates concentrated on how to get more players to play \u2192 buy crates \u2192 buy and sell items. The lack of love is so apparent in the development of this game that it leaves me and all my friends wondering if the developers are actually gamers themselves at all.\n\nI got this game very soon after the launch and played regularly over the years. I watched a fun functional game turn into a monotonic mess. \nLet\u2019s look at the changes / functions closer:\n\nNormal Battle Royale:\n- When the game first got out, it had a good interesting map with a lot of foliage and natural formations. This allowed players to have more than one strategy. This is the only time when the items they sold were useful because you could actually take advantage of things like camo. Soon the developers cut the map\u2019s size, removed almost all the interesting places and pretty much all the foliage. This was no doubt a way to cater to an audience with cheaper computers. The end result is horrible: nothing but open level fields without foliage or even rocks to take cover behind. In a way it looks like a 12 year old\u2019s first attempt at making a map in Unity using nothing but free store assets. The map looks unprofessional and is boring to play in.\n- Let\u2019s mention this again. There is only 1 map.\n- Guns used to feel steady. Now the recoil is like everyone is missing an arm. As someone who has handled multiple different firearms in her life I can tell that it doesn\u2019t work like this.\n- The original way of fighting but also having to worry about the location of the safe zone was more interesting and actually required some brains to do. Now they added all sorts of ease-of-access map markers to make sure anyone with 50IQ or less can just spawn into the safe zone and pew pew pew / repeat.\n- There\u2019s only one way to play. Because of the emptiness of the map and the safe zone always concentrating on an open level field, the only way to survive is to get a car and keep moving. On foot you never have a place to hide behind and end up being shot down in seconds by someone with a car. This wasn\u2019t the case before, using a car was only one of the multiple ways you could approach winning the match.\n- Cheaters. This problem got a lot worse after the game went ftp.\n- Desync.\n- Annoying things like grenade blasts and gas grenade gas passing walls / floors.\n- Again, cars. They used to be rare. This was nice because it forced people to play in more than just one way. Now cars are literally everywhere, it takes less than a minute for a 5-person team to have a vehicle for every person.\n- People don\u2019t play. Trying to play fives after 1AM in EU is borderline impossible because the lobby has less than 5 teams.\n\nCar Royale:\nNote that this would be a really fun mode if it actually worked.\n\n- Desync.\n- Getting stuck on walls / railings.\n- Duos never available.\n- Takes forever to start a match.\n- Impossible to start a match after 1AM due to no-one playing this game.\n- A griefer\u2019s heaven. Why? There is no vote kick or any way to lock a spot on your team. If you have the misfortune to not actually have 4 people available to play, you are at the mercy of the 1 random person who gets matched with your team forcibly. This one person has a multitude of ways to screw over the team: stealing all healing items, using molotovs to set your own team\u2019s car on fire, using grenades to hurt your own team\u2019s car, using mines to hurt your own team, using the crossbow or the rpg to hurt your own team or (and this is the best part) getting angry over not getting a special weapon like the crossbow and taking the ammo into his own inventory even if someone else has the crossbow. Note that the person who actually has the weapon cannot take the ammo into their own inventory and use it, only the ones without the weapon can take it and make it unavailable for the person who has it. If the randomer ends up as the driver he has plenty of new ways to troll. These people are more common than you\u2019d think and seem to be playing this mode solely for this purpose.\n- The unwinnable match. If you play 10 matches, about 3-4 out of those matches are unwinnable by default. Not because of the skill of your team but because of the system not registering the destruction of a team if they have a 2000ping ftp player connecting while they died. This leads to you being alone in the safe zone with no-one to kill, yet the system says there is still one person/team alive besides you.\n- The 2000 ping players. Again, there is no vote kick or any way to get this person off your team. If you play with 2 friends 8 times out of 10 your last team mate is this person. Why is it a problem then? I\u2019ll tell you. After you spawn, you need to change the driver if your team has a person that always drives. But if someone is still connecting, you cannot change the seats. Odds are you end up driving around half the match with the randomer still connecting. Again one of those awesome things brought to us by making the game ftp.\n- The quality of the player base. I didn\u2019t mention this on the normal Battle Royale because it\u2019s not a bother there but in Car Royale it is. Team games are a great way to meet new gamers like yourself, make friends and hone your teamwork skills. This game has nothing but ftp players left. This means people without steam profiles, microphones, teamwork skills or even the ability to connect into the match.\n\nThe game has been going downhill for a long time due to many of the reasons I\u2019ve stated above and people have spoken out. Just look at the reviews (even before the game went ftp).\nAnd how does Daybreak answer the gamers? By reverting back to the old map? No. By changing the shooting mechanics back to how they used to be? No. \nThey answer by releasing more items. And crates. And hoodies that cost 16 euros. And Weapon skins that cost 10 euros. \n\nDaybreak will never get another cent from me. \nDisrespecting your own game and your player base like this is like disrespecting the entire gamer culture. Gamers can see when a developer develops for the money and not for the love of the game. And this is why this game is dead.

At this time the game was full of bugs, well I didn't judge in those days, because it was an Early-Access-Version of the game.\n\nThough it had a lot of bugs, it was really fun to play, with friends of course.\nAt this time you actually were getting rewards for winning, even if you were playing in a group. Nowadays you will not get rewarded after winning when playing with a group. So for some people (including me), the motivation to win was missing, since those days.\n\nAfter the Developer Studio switched and reorganized from Sony Online Entertainment to Daybreak Games (TheyBreak Games     ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ) the game was on their way to fall down.\nYou couldn't see any progress in developing, major bugs existed for months, the priority list of Daybreak Games was disastrous. Well though I had those bad impressions, I wasn't missing the fun at this time. \nIn 2016 they made the decision split the game into two. H1Z1: Just Survive and H1Z1: King of the Kill. I had hope in the developement of this game again, because I thought maybe it will help them to organize themselfs better and to set priorities.\n\nOn one side I was happy that they brought some new stuff, new gamemodes to play, events, etc., like Ignition, Skirmish, Green Dawn, Hardcore, but on the other side major bugs still existed. But for me, it was still fun to play.\nLater 2016 they have made their biggest mistake. They (re)-\"launched\" their game (fun-fact: its still in early-access) and promised a major change in gameplay, graphics, performance and developing. So let's see what the \"launch\" brought us:\n\n(1) They have removed the old map and replaced it with the new Z2-Map. You might ask yourself now, what, is so bad about the new Z2-Map?:\n- Though they promised graphic enhancements, they've just increased the color saturation, to pretend, that graphics are better now. But as you might guess: They are not even close to better. The lightnings in the buildings are worse then ever. You can hardly see the loot inside of the buildings.\n- The actual reason for why the map was changed was that the devs thought, that the original map was maybe a bit too much copy and pasted. Here is my opionion on that: The new map is even more copy and pasted. Almost every buildings looks the same.\n- There are no real memorial places or fighting spots, like they were on the original map. Maybe it is because that I am a little bit nostalgic, but people who have played the original H1Z1 will understand me, when I rave about PV Police-Station, Radio-Tower, Opfer Camp, Reservoir Dam, B2, Hospital, etc, etc...\n- Loot is clipping inside of the textures so you cannot pick it up. This bug exists since almost half a year now.\n- Floating trees and ugly streets and textures are daily fare.\n- They won't give us the opportunity to play the old map, since they \"deleted it by mistake\" so they said. (Another fun-fact: the old map is still available in H1Z1: JS, so there is no way that it had been deleted)\n- There is no pit in the new Box of Destiny. Where the hell shall summit go then?\n\n(2) They have made a major change to the Interface and the HUD, which in my eyes clearly looks fancier but is actually worse than the original, because it seems really unclearly to me.\n\n(3) The translations are actually worse than google translator.\n\n(4) They have removed previous exlusive gamemodes, so you can't play them anymore. Well there is the ability to do so, but there never had been an event where you can play them.\n\n(5) They brought in a new rewards system and removed the old one. Unfortunatley, I never could experience those, because as you might noticed, I was always playing with friends. But nope, there are still no rewards for groups.\n\n(6) The performance is still as bad as in the old H1Z1.\n\nYou might ask yourself now, why did they make those changes and why did they relaunch the game?\nClear answer boys: to market the game more efficient.\n\nI have lost faith in this game and thats why I felt the need to write this review.\n\nI have the bad feeling that this game won't get any better, since the problem-solving approaches from the developers are slow, less efficient and mostly alternative and do not treat the cause of most problems.\n\nEdit: \n_______\n\nWhen the game was fun - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlvQDVWNsmg\n\nI will always remember you Z1. <3\n\nShame on you greedy devs!

Its like if you had spent 2 hours on far cry 2 editor. No details at all. Same shitty vegetation brush everywhere. \n- 3 main weapons: shotgun, ar15 and ak47. So poor.\n- Queues to play. Such long queues. Was it that expensive to buy more servers? Oh wait...thats what the next point kicks right in.\n- Developers only care about money. For real. Updates only had small fixes like \"ak now is a bit less powerful\" or \"car speed reduced\" and all the rest was about 100 shitty skins for which you have to buy keys and crates. Its such a rip off. Its an alpha game, for fucks sake, and they charge you like millions for skins. Winning battle royale only gives you horrible loot which is absolutely worthless, because, of course, they do not want you to get cool content by winning and proving yourself to be good, no, they want you to spend more moneyz in their alpha game which will never be completed except for the fantastic crate&key system. They even have their in-game money. Why? So they can control the price of keys. It would be fatal for them if people could sell keys or crates.\nIts so disgusting to see that as soon as they get some fame, they instantly forget about the game and start looking for all kinds of ideas to rip you off. It bothered me so hard that my ingame name in DayZ SA is \"H1Z1Sucks\".\nSeriously, only buy this game if all you care is about BUYING content that otherwise you would get for free. In addition (but last) their fuckin brilliant bussinessmen came up with the idea of splitting the game in two, so that instead of having one alpha game with two game modes, they had 2 broken alpha games for each 20\u20ac. And the worst is, they tried to make us believe it was because \"they wanted to focus more\". \n\nOh, and as I write I remember another thing, the \"Green Battle royal\" or whatever it was called. They realised people only played for the BR mode, so they thought \"Hey, could we charge them for playing BR mode? Oh yea we can, but lets disguise it as a new mode with extra luxury weapon skins\".

But, it is just ONE game mode. So, ask yourself if it is worth buying a 20\u20ac game for just ONE gamemode, a gamemode previously part of another game!?\n\n-----\n\nDaybreak claims that they will be adding more gamemodes, but that's yet to be seen. We don't know what gamemodes or how many will be added. Reading the early acces page they claim to add additional gamemodes and game rules. Judging the history of this game/development, I would not be supprised if they only add slight variations of the ONE gamemode Battle Royal.\n\nBefore the split, there already where 3 variants of this game mode, you had one without zombies, one with zombies and one with special rewards for winning! This last mode was behind a cash wall and you need to buy tickets for real hard cash to join this mode.\n\nTechnicly they could say they have 3 gamemodes. Then you have the same game with team of 2, or team of 5 players. So there you have it, 5 gamemodes! :P\n\nWe have to wait and see what the new gamemodes are, if any are added!\n\nAsk yourself, knowing this, is ONE gamemode still worth 20\u20ac?\n\n-----\n\nLet's inform you some more, because this game has a rocky history with many claims that never became reality!\n\nThey ones claimed to NEVER add pay2win mechanics to this game, then airdrops where added to survival mode that gave you food, water, weapons and ammo! Airdrops are behind a paywall from real hard cash! Though they changed the way this works but still ...\n\nThey claimed this game would become free2play ones released. Guess what, it's 20\u20ac with additional supply crates and cosmatic microtransactions! Even payed gamemodes like the Battle Royal variant (Green Dawn) and airdrops for ingame loot.\n\nAgain, ask yourself, is this game worth 20\u20ac, with possible new gamemodes behind cash wall, with micro transactions and many broken promises?\n\nThen the worst part, the recent split of H1Z1 into two games. \n\nThis game, King of the Kill, was part of the original H1Z1. You had survival servers and Battle Royal servers! Now you have the survival game, 20\u20ac and the battle royal game for another 20\u20ac! And what would happen if say a new gamemode is added to King of the Kill, which becomes very popular, will they split agian? Who knows!?\n\nThis split would not be the worst of things, if they cut the price in half. Would be fair since they cut the game in half but nope, now you pay 2x20\u20ac for something that ones was 1x20\u20ac, for something that ones was promised to be free2play!\n\nAlso, remember you now need to pay double for microtransactions. Getting a new piece of clothing from a microtransaction was universal availible for all servers and gamemodes. Now, if you want that same piece of clothing be prepared to buy the same item twice!!!\n\nKnowing all of this, ask yourself is ONE gamemode worth 20\u20ac?\n\n-----\n\nWith this out of the way you might want to know if this ONE gamemode is fun and yes, I said I have lots of fun with this gamemode. So let's get into that!\n\nYou spawn with around 150 other players on a large open map. Everyone drops down from the sky with a parasute. It's now time to land as fast as you can, so you can be the first to loot weapons, ammo, backpacks and more. So you can be the first to blast others in the face.\n\nAfter a few minutes a savezone is drawn on your map, because toxic fog will be released and slowly drive you towards the savezone. This mechanic is fun and usefull to drive the remaining players towards the same spot.\n\nThough there is only ONE map it's big enough to be fun for a long time. Mainly because a lot of things are random. Not the map itself but your spawn location is random, weapon spawns are random and the savezones are random. One match ends in an urban location and another on top of the mountains.\n\nAll seems good, but there is also a lot wrong with the game and it's mechanics!\n\nSpawning for example! You don't spawn at the same time as your enemies. It depends on your loading time, internet connection and random bad luck (sometimes the game takes 2 or 3 times longer to load). This means people with faster hardware and internet connection land faster, getting guns fasters and thus have an increased change to win!\n\nNext problem is that hitbox detection and netcode are so random. With a bit of bad luck you can shoot somebody in the head for multiple times without them dieing. While other times you one hit kill them.\n\nSame with the shotgun, it's spread pattern is random. So you can almost get sniped from long distance with a shotgun while other times you can't hit/kill somebody at close range! And it's all luck, or badluck depending how it ends!\n\nOn top of that there aren't many weapons and in the end it comes down to AR15 for long range, shotgun for close range. Perhaps the AK47 (though it got nerved) or if you are lucky the hunting rifle (sniper that only drops from airdrops). All the other weapons are just useless compared to the above, so bows, crossbows and pistols are ignored!

I will be naming the pros and cons just so you can make a decision for yourself.(*In my opinion* If you don't have any friends to play with don't buy it...)\n\nPROS:\n\n-The PVP is quite good and comparing to other BR games, its the best out there,\n-If you have friends it can be an emerging experience and a lot of fun.\n-The gun mechanics are somewhat cool.\n-The variety of items in the game, even though there are barely some, have some use and you will most likely like them.\n-Car mechanics are somewhat decent.\n-A lot of places to loot.\n\nCONS: (Im starting from the glitches that happen from the loading screen untill we are on the arena)\n-When entering the game if you have a bad connection so many glitches will happen, like not having a parachute, landing under the map, landing and then 2 seconds into the game dying to the environment, etc...\n-Sometimes while trying to enter a car you will receive a message saying ''Something is in the way'' and you won't be able to enter.\n-Jumping from a 2 feet rock will make you lose HP.\n-Some players either are hacking or have an amazing aim, you will see this since they hit you from over 100 meters, every single shot and this is annoying because if you stop to shoot at them you miss every shot when on the other hand they hit every single one.\n-When you shoot at someone, and you are sure you tagged him, after he kills you, sometimes you will see his HP at 0 but he will still be running and jumping.\n-Entered a jip, waited for my friend he entered aswell, turned on the engine pressed W to go foward and died to ''Disconnect''.\n-The bombs dropped from the plane are bad since the day I bought this game which was over a year now, if they drop on top you you probably won't die unless you have like 10 HP.\n-There is a rank system which im not even sure if you play against your own rank. (I was on the worst one Silver V and saw guys that would hit someone 100 meters away and 2 tap them).\n-There is a level system which every 5 levels you get an unlocked case and you can open them to get some clothes, we should get cases every level because on the higher ones it becomes a grind to level up.\n-When you finish in the top 10 you get nothing, you only win something if you bet on yourself free coins which after finishing in top 15 (I think) gets you skulls to unlock the limited clothes they have on the skull shop, and it only has like 10 cosmetics.\n\n***SIDE NOTE***\n\nThe developers of this game are the worst, they only care about your money. After buying the game from SONY they decided to split the game (H1Z1: Just Survive and H1Z1: King of the Kill) this was the most stupid business stunt I have ever seen in my life (Since now Just Survive has pretty much no interest to them). They did this to have a team working on Just Survive and another team working on KOTK, LOL, since Just Survive is getting little to no updates I don't think they are putting much effort into it. KOTK is pretty much a carnival party at this point, all you see is players dressed up in a huge amount of colors that make them look like fucking clowns. The KOTK game became a pay-2-dress and everytime they update the game we only see cases, little tweaks to guns and no major/game breaking glitches getting fixed. You pay 20$ (or 10$ on sale) to play a game that its main focus is who looks the prettiest. Or pay 20$ (or 10$ on sale) for Just Survive to play a game that has basically no updates and the dev team doesn't really care about. In my opinion you shouldn't buy the game but after what you read you make your own decision.", "timestamp_created": 1483559659, "timestamp_updated": 1520537574, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 629, "votes_funny": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.834875524044036865", "comment_count": 73, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "44614896": {"recommendationid": "44614896", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142494667", "num_games_owned": 743, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520190679}, "language": "english", "review": "Daybreak their game.", "timestamp_created": 1536328133, "timestamp_updated": 1536328133, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 75, "votes_funny": 136, "weighted_vote_score": "0.789614021778106689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40615121": {"recommendationid": "40615121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044269519", "num_games_owned": 298, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500923953}, "language": "english", "review": "The developers had their chance to make a great Battle Royale game, and they completely screwed it up.

When finally inside the pre-game arena, make sure to scream as loud as you can and insult other players as much as possible. Perhaps let them know what size your weiner is?\n\n4.

It was quick, full of people, very competitive, always gave you that rush. It was good for alpha, but then you started to notice something. \n- The map sucks. Its like if you had spent 2 hours on far cry 2 editor. No details at all. Same \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 vegetation brush everywhere. \n- 3 main weapons: shotgun, ar15 and ak47. So poor.\n- Queues to play. Such long queues. Was it that expensive to buy more servers? Oh wait...thats what the next point kicks right in.\n- Developers only care about money. For real. Updates only had small fixes like \"ak now is a bit less powerful\" or \"car speed reduced\" and all the rest was about 100 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 skins for which you have to buy keys and crates. Its such a rip off. Its an alpha game, for \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s sake, and they charge you like millions for skins. Winning battle royale only gives you horrible loot which is absolutely worthless, because, of course, they do not want you to get cool content by winning and proving yourself to be good, no, they want you to spend more moneyz in their alpha game which will never be completed except for the fantastic crate&key system. They even have their in-game money. Why? So they can control the price of keys. It would be fatal for them if people could sell keys or crates.\nIts so disgusting to see that as soon as they get some fame, they instantly forget about the game and start looking for all kinds of ideas to rip you off. It bothered me so hard that my ingame name in DayZ SA is \"H1Z1Sucks\".\nSeriously, only buy this game if all you care is about BUYING content that otherwise you would get for free. In addition (but last) their \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665in brilliant bussinessmen came up with the idea of splitting the game in two, so that instead of having one alpha game with two game modes, they had 2 broken alpha games for each 20\u20ac. And the worst is, they tried to make us believe it was because \"they wanted to focus more\". \n\nOh, and as I write I remember another thing, the \"Green Battle royal\" or whatever it was called. They realised people only played for the BR mode, so they thought \"Hey, could we charge them for playing BR mode? Oh yea we can, but lets disguise it as a new mode with extra luxury weapon skins\". Then you win the br green and you check your AR15 skin and realise they only put 30 seconds in sprayin some green \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 brush over the model. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665in brilliant.", "timestamp_created": 1498579979, "timestamp_updated": 1498579979, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 354, "votes_funny": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.815237224102020264", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "41359588": {"recommendationid": "41359588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286672801", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520510334}, "language": "english", "review": "Am i the only one that thinks we should some sort of refund for purchasing this game, now its free?\n\ni havnt been on for a while( work and health reasons) but would like some retrubution for this.. or am i wrong?", "timestamp_created": 1523184686, "timestamp_updated": 1523184686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 375, "votes_funny": 47, "weighted_vote_score": "0.818634033203125", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26465732": {"recommendationid": "26465732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116696197", "num_games_owned": 387, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 10706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1521391925}, "language": "english", "review": "The devs seem to ignore all the issues and problems but still adding new crates and skins.", "timestamp_created": 1478471820, "timestamp_updated": 1525136010, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 316, "votes_funny": 28, "weighted_vote_score": "0.779432952404022217", "comment_count": 27, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28289324": {"recommendationid": "28289324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138206976", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 3787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502192581}, "language": "english", "review": "Steam trophy award 2016 for the buggiest game ever\n\nEDIT 8 april:\nOMG they finally made an update!

And it comes to no surprise, while PUBG has done a great job updating the game regulary, H1Z1 has had very slow updates, at times it felt like they didn't really add anything for up to 6 months. And to be honest, I get the feeling that they simply were pretty lazy, because prior to PUBG and Fortnite, H1Z1 was on top of the charts with a large and growing player base, but then PUBG came along and changed that. \n\nIt's not until now that big things has started to happen with H1Z1, because now they have to compete with both PUBG and Fortnite which more or less has taken oven the world at this point. The latest big addition came when the game left early access, a gamemode called \"Autoroyale\" which as it sounds, is battle royale strictly using cars. The game mode was actually surprisingly fun, so I have to give them that. \n\nNow, as the playerbase started to fade away for H1Z1 they took the bold move to make the game free to play, which in a way was needed to compete. BUT, the problem with this is the fact that they did it about a week after leaving and advertising that the game is finally out of Early Access, many people bought the game just a week ago and now they made the game free to play, which is a massive kick inbetween the legs to many consumers. And I'm pretty sure this was intentional. \n\nPutting things like slow development and somewhat questionable actions aside, the game does offer some fun both by yourself or with friends. It's by no means unplayable and can honestly be a fun and more \"arcade-ish\" take on the battle royale genre. And as the game now is free to play there is no reason why you shouldn't give it a go, since you don't have much to lose.
