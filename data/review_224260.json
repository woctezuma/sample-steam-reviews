There's dozens of weapons ranging from guns to melee. There's always room for trying new strategies for the hordes of undead. There's a modest number of maps but each map has a changing structure that makes it different each playthrough. And both objective and survival gamemodes are equally fun. But as a personal opinion, objective maps are too easy as sometimes you can pretty much speedrun your way through the map and leave everyone behind with the zombies. Overall, it's a perfect zombie game and hearing the accompanying \"pop\" when you blow a zombies head off is pretty damn awesome.

This is not how it works. This is not L4D. \n\nIf I buy a game that I KNOW it requires teamwork, I read the guides to have an idea what I'm about to do before joining a game. Just to not make the older players sick. I might perform bad, not everyone will succeed on their first try. ESPECIALLY in this game... But not these people. Hell I'll be happy if newbies just listened to older players instead of running around wasting bullets. Sadly no. You got hoarders, spray n prayers, little kids and people who don't understand English. This is %90 on public servers. BUT if you play with your friends or find at least 3-4 people that uses mic/chat by any chance, then you can go on for hours.\n\nI'd pay the shat out of this game just to have a decent player-base.

A game which is not gentle, that does not have a learning cure so much as a learning cliff. A game which shows nothing but brutality to it's players. This game is a labour of love, with many, many hours obviously put into it to make as best a game as the developers could. They knew what they were going for, a semi-realistic zombie apocalypse that shows no mercy and they went for it.\n\nOf course, this introduces problems.\n\nLet's start with the learning curve. As mentioned before, this game has not so much a learning curve as a learning cliff, so you might expect a short moment on how to explain game mechanics, or at least, hints and tips while the game loads for you? Reasonable to expect, isn't it? Well, no. You don't get that at all. There is no kindness, no compassion, no one or nothing to give you a holding hand; this game chucks you in the deep end, then expects you to know breast stroke. Now other games have done this, Dark Souls being the most infamous, but Dark Souls took a moment to explain what was going on. It told you how to raise your shield, explained how to equip, and how to use the bonfies. No such luck here. You're in a bulding that is secure, and the moment you walk out that door, zombies. Lots and lots of zombies.\n\nNow having one or two zombies at first to get used to them, to know how to deal with them, again, would be standard fare. Nothing wrong with being exposed to a new enemy type slowly, to let you understand and get used to. Not so with this game, oh no. Try a few dozen. And you don't know what to do beyond kill. You might have a few weapons, but they float through the air, seemingly not connecting to anything, which means that you have to spend a few swings getting used to weapons. And in a game this lethal and unforgiving, those few practice swings will cost you dearly. And you will die.\n\nNow one mechaninc that you might know is that being grabbed can only be resolved by pushing (which is V by default). What you may not know is that zombies can grab through wire fences and windows (wether or not this is a bug is something else entirely) and if that happens, you are beyond all hope. Another thing that you might guess that being grabbed and then bitten is bad, and it is, but being bitten is not well shown. Beyond the zombie jerking a bit, you may not even know you've been bitten until you begin to show the signs. And if you are bitten, death is inevitable. You have two minutes. Spend them well by either finding pills to buy you more time (no cure here), jump off a ledge, or simply beg someone to kill you.\n\nNow the inventory may take some getting used to. You have two inventory wheels, one for ammo, one for weapons. The bigger, bulkier, and heavier something is, the more space it takes, and you don't have many pockets. So of course you need to manage inventory space, which is perfectly fine, this is a horror survival game after all. Nothing wrong with that. In fact, I applaud it. I don't want to be carrying two rifles, three pistols, and a big ass sledge hammer. I'm not a goddamn space marine here, and this isn't the game for them. Ammo is counted in weight and mass as well, which makes sense.\n\nAnd, of course, the zombies. Oh, the Zombies. These are standard Romero-Zombies. Undead who feel no pain, fear, or emotion and operate entirely on instinct. Woth noting, hwoever, that the eyesight of a zombie is perfect. I'm not kidding;  they have perfect, near 360 degree awareness of everything that not even you or I should be able to see. Two stories directly overhead? They can see you. Small dot on the horizon in a darkened room? They know you're there. Pitch blackness? Sure as fuck they know you're there. \n\nAnd while this does make for a fun and entertaining horror game, there is one more flaw. Multiplayer. Now, I know what you're saying: But Left 4 Dead and Payday did it perfectly! How can this be possible!? Well here's why. For starters, Valve knew that players can't communicate well with strangers on the other side of the world. They knew that coordination was next to impossible. They knew that players naturally deviate from each other at all times. So how did they solve this? Simple. You always knew, at a glance, how your fellow players were doing, and where they were. They had glowing outlines that showed at any distance, and maps were linear to prevent fanning out by players. Maps in valves games were funnels, and even Overkill understood this by making the map around easy to navigate and open buldings made as simplistic as possible.\n\nMultiplayer is a mess. Players do not communicate well with others over large distances. Most players don't even have microphones, so that idea with walkie talkies where players far away can't talk without them? A waste of time since text speech does not work with walkie talkies, so you must be right next to them to work. Maps are cramped, narrow things that while linear, often curve in on themselves and encourage exporation. Again, not a problem, except that players naturally do not drift together, they drift apart because they have no sense of surroundings at the best of times and are given no way to drift back together.\n\nThis game strikes me as a single player game trying to do the work of multiplayer. It just can't work. It doesn't work. Bad bugs (or bad mechanics, that's unclear), an extreme difficulty curve beyond any sane resembelance and poor combat mechanics and jerky, overwhelming numbers of undead at all times mean that players will only have an experience of death, more death, and of course death, all without any real progression. This game isn't just hard, it's near unplayable through it's obscene diffculty spikes and poorly designed multiplayer maps.\n\nThis is not to say that it's bad, heck, I had loads of fun playing it, but it is very much a niche game. If you don't want to play this sort of game, skip it over, but I reccomend playing this game just for the experience.", "timestamp_created": 1397484670, "timestamp_updated": 1408094182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 314, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.896406769752502441", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15210167": {"recommendationid": "15210167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051410543", "num_games_owned": 585, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492352904}, "language": "english", "review": "You're in for a world of pain.\n\nNo More Room in Hell (NMRiH for short) is a zombie-survival game with intense themes. You can see blood, death, and despair everywhere. Body bags on the street, with crashed cars and stores that are boarded up. There's a few weapons left, and you plus up to 5 other survivors have to make it to an extraction point by doing many different objectives. One objective could be quick as hell. Another might take tons of minutes. \n\nThere are tons of zombies that are all really slow. It'll take a while before they'll get you, Barbara, but when they do, unless you're prepared you're pretty much dead. There are normal zombies, fast zombies, and child zombies. Normal are easy to kill, just hold down Mouse 1, release and then quickly press the V button (THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! It pushes zombies back, and has saved my life A SHIT TON of times) and then do it again until they're dead. Fast zombies are the same as normal zombies, but they go faster and attack faster. Child zombies are quick too, but they can't bite you, only make you bleed. Melee weapons usually take two or three hits to the head, charged before they'll kill one zombie. If you just sway your weapon back and forth you'll find yourself either empty on stamina, or dead. \n\nA gun is good, but they're not common and ammo for the right gun, YOUR gun, is even more rare. A Beretta 92 or a Glock 17 will take 2 hits to the head (Or 1 if you stand still for a while, this is called \"Deadeye\") but their ammo is common and they have a large capacity. A 1911 will only need 1 bullet to the head, but ammo for that is rare and so is the gun itself, and it's only got a capacity of 7+1, but it will bring a world of pain to the zombies. A revolver is handy but it's got a lot of recoil, 6 shots and rare as hell ammo. Then there's big guns, MAC-10, MP5, M16A4, CZ858, Shotguns and Sniper Rifles, all of which take a lot of inventory space and have rare ammo (Except for MAC-10 and MP5, who uses .45ACP and 9mm), and they're all rare too. What I'm trying to say here is that all you need is a pistol and a good melee weapon to survive.\n\nThen there are survival maps, which are about you and your team bunkering down and trying to protect one, two or three areas at the same time. These maps are very intense, and your team has to survive some waves with limited supplies and a horde of zombies. Hammer and planks are going to be your best friend, since they can slow down the zombies, but not forever. And sometimes The National Guard will drop in supplies for you and your team. This can include melee weapons, guns & ammo, medical supplies and other useful and handy supplies.\n\nHowever, do not download this game if you are easily scared, this is a pretty scary games with dark enviroments and scary enemies.", "timestamp_created": 1428187926, "timestamp_updated": 1428187926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 213, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.911895990371704102", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9382724": {"recommendationid": "9382724", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009346461", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1539206398}, "language": "english", "review": "At first this game will frustrate you, it seems virtually impossible to kill more than 10 zombies without dying yourself, and you find yourself walking around with empty guns.

The weapons are fun to use and actually require a decent amount of skill (what with the lack of crosshairs, limited amount of ammo, and wide variety of melee weapons). The zombies work well too, crawlers, walkers, runners, and kids all provide a bit of variety and can spice up the game/scare the hell out of you. All in all it's a very enjoyable game and I hope the developers continue to work on it and the community continues to support it. \n\nTIPS:    \n1. Use your sights.\n2. If you melee, PUSH the zombies away after every swing. \n3. Communicate, even without a mic it's really useful.\n4. Don't waste ammo. (Especially on the first few rounds of a survival map)\n5. Don't hoard ammo you aren't using, chances are someone else needs it.\n6. Don't attack the same zombie at once. It wastes ammo or it clusters people up so they miss their swings. \n7. Use the flare gun to call in supplies (Survival).\n8. Conserve your energy, if you're out of breath, back away for a few seconds.\n9. If you're infected call it out.

Nothing makes sense and everything is confusing. The default controls aren't incredibly intuitive, melee feels like it's worthless, you run out of stamina as with as little as two or three swings for some weapons, and although the guns feel great, good luck finding a decent amount of ammo (especially if you're playing online). But if you just have a bit a patience, remap some of the controls and understand that this isn't meant to be a fast-paced guns blazing action game, you might find yourself enjoying the game a little. Or a lot. \n\nSomeone, maybe one of the curators, I can't remember, said this game is similar to Resident Evil 2 only in first person, and I just love that comparison. I mentioned earlier that generally you might have a hard time finding a decent amount of ammo. If you're playing online with strangers, this pretty much always applies, however if you're playing with some friends, it's very possible you could get a nice stockpile of ammo going, especially if you're playing a survival map. In objective maps, however, ammo is very scarce for the most part. Occasionally, you might be blessed with more ammo than other runs, but the thing that makes this game always interesting and stressful (in a good way!) is that it's not usually very efficient trying to take on a horde of zombies, even with all the ammo you have. You're standing there, unleashing all of your might, but the longer you stand in one place, the more zombies start to come your way. It becomes too much, so your best chance is to try and run through and dodge as many zombies as you can, saving any ammo for when you really need it. It's really satisfying making it through the small openings you're given in a horde and potentially saving tons of ammo.\n\nI also mentioned above that guns feel good, which is very true. Guns are a lot of fun to use in this game, and popping heads with bullets into a bloody burst feels as good as Resident Evil 4. They even made the piece of shit Ruger gun sounds way more satisfying in the last update they did, so even though the guns are still a piece of crap, at least they feel nice to use.\n\nOne thing that I love about this game is the difficulty. It's not easy. My friends and I have beaten every single official map, with one map in particular taking what seemed like weeks to get through (FEMA) and others taking days of attempts (Junction, Zephyr, and... Most of the survival maps, actually). This might seem like a weird comparison, but this game almost has that old \"NES Hard\" feel to it, because even though a lot of the times your plans are  foiled by zombies growing elastic arms and somehow hitting you after you shoved them away and blasted them point blank in the face with a fucking shotgun come ON HOW DOES THAT NOT KILL YOU, there's still an incredibly rewarding feeling from beating a map that kicked your ass tons of times. Oh, but uh, get some friends if you can, at least one, because I don't think most maps can be beaten solo. Also adding to the NES hard feel of the game is that most survival maps can actually be beaten in 10-20 minutes once you know what to do. They're fun to replay through too, because every single weapon in this game has an achievement, so if you're not playing with greedy scumbag strangers online, you and your friend(s) can decide over which weapons to use, changing how the run will go, even if slightly. Also adding to the replayability factor is that a lot of the item locations on maps are randomized. Some might dislike that sometimes you can get a fully loaded FN Fal on a table and other times a fucking flashlight, but in most cases, it's just different kinds of ammo, so it's nice to have some variety for the many times you will have to try to complete certain maps.\n\nSpeaking of maps, there are a lot of custom maps for this game too, which is awesome, because sometimes you just want something different. Truth be told, a lot of the custom maps I've played, survival ones especially, are easier than official maps, so if you're new to the game and having difficulties, it might be wise to try out some of the more lenient custom maps there are. I personally recommend a map called Museum, as it has a LOT of supplies to start you out with, and I really do mean a lot, and there are supply drops every few rounds as well. Plus the map looks good.\n\n...And if you REALLY want to have a good time, download a map called \"Mansion.\" You'll know you have one I'm talking about if the spawn point is always around a poker table on the second floor. Here's what you want to do, open the console command with the ~ button and bind the kill command to a key, preferrably one that's away from most of your other commmonly used keys so you don't acidentally kill yourself. Anyway, jump off the balcony towards the small railing and kill yourself in midair and watch your ragdoll smack against the railing and spaz out while it does flips and twirls as it flies off. Pure comedy gold, I promise you. Even better if you have a buddy to watch/join the fun.\n\nAside from that, do what you want! This game has a lot to offer, and it's FREE! This game made me buy Contagion, a $20 game also about zombies and survival. It's a piece of shit, at least compared to this completely free game. A darn shame, but now you have $20 bucks that you didn't spend on shit, you could buy TWO copies of the soundtrack for this game if you wanted. \n\nA couple things to mention if you're still reading and are interested in the game:\n\"Mastering\" melee combat is essential. First off, everytime you swing, SHOVE IMMEDIATELY AFTER. This will almost always hit the enemy and push them back, stopping them from attacking you, because you see, melee hits don't always stagger zombies, so you could swing a giant fubar at a zombie, crack its skull, and it's still swinging at you. Don't let that shit fly. Shove, shove, and shove again. Also, melee attacks can be charged by holding down the attack button. If you charge a melee attack for a full 3 seconds or longer and aim for the head, it will almost always kill any enemy with  the exception of armored zombies. This works with nearly every weapon, even the wrench, but not your fists.\n\nAnd finally, some good maps to start playing are \nObjective:\nLakeside (Easiest objective map by far. It's short and pretty straightforward and gives you a decent amount of supplies.)\nChinatown (Not exactly easy, but a very fun map to play because overall it isn't very long and there's gun shop!)\nCabin (Also not extremely easy, but short.)\n\nSurvival:\nFlooded (Supply drops after every second round and wide open ranges for melee attacking.)\nMidwest (This map might seem hard at first, but if you search for the key to the locker in the gun shop, all of your problems are solved.)\nSilence (Great atmosphere, lots of areas that you need to find keys and blowtorches to get into for more supplies.)", "timestamp_created": 1444829798, "timestamp_updated": 1444829941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 66, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.838300049304962158", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36519385": {"recommendationid": "36519385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037920209", "num_games_owned": 763, "num_reviews": 564, "playtime_forever": 592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416728612}, "language": "english", "review": "When I play this game I imagine myself killing vast armies of EA representatives.", "timestamp_created": 1510694428, "timestamp_updated": 1510694428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 179, "votes_funny": 240, "weighted_vote_score": "0.855838000774383545", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38388335": {"recommendationid": "38388335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037468003", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 870, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513649723}, "language": "english", "review": "This game makes me hate children even more.", "timestamp_created": 1513550990, "timestamp_updated": 1513550990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 150, "weighted_vote_score": "0.811613857746124268", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23440368": {"recommendationid": "23440368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139218458", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1532560977}, "language": "english", "review": "I saw a zombie wearing a shirt that said, \"I'm Vegan\".", "timestamp_created": 1465327187, "timestamp_updated": 1465327187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 203, "votes_funny": 738, "weighted_vote_score": "0.858938276767730713", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "41058617": {"recommendationid": "41058617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033713757", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 13145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550515276}, "language": "english", "review": "Free zombie coop source mod that's not for everyone, but it's free so no funds needed to try it out.

[b] Classic [/b] features limited respawns based on gamemode and map, zed spawn is normalized allowing for massive hoards in open areas, voice chat will become ranged based unless two players are equiped with the walkie talkie, dead players cannot communicate with living players (depends on server). [b] Nightmare [/b] features most everything from classic except zeds spawn in greater numbers, zeds all have doubled hp and increased damage, chance of infection is greatly increased from bites.

This mode tends to require more players due to the nature of defending specific areas from being occupied by zeds or else you lose. Every once in awhile a supply drop will come to help bolster weapon supplies, can be abused if the map has a flare gun allowing a supply to come every wave. Players will respawn every wave.\n\n[*]Objective requires players to navigate specific routes in the map and complete objectives that'll eventually lead to the escape. This mode tends to be less enjoyable at first if no one knows what to do due to the vague descriptions and never learning the compass button. Routes are randomized from a few set pieces allowing for a slightly different experience each run. Staying alive is highly important due to spawns being less prominent so warning for those whom enjoy playing and not watching others (0-2 depending on the map).\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1522048439, "timestamp_updated": 1550516476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.781573593616485596", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12720163": {"recommendationid": "12720163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070774816", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 11673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1534279827}, "language": "english", "review": "No More Room in Hell is a zombie survival game. There are 2 modes, one called Survival and one called Objective. Survival is where you (and your teammates) have to hold down an area or multiple areas from waves of zombies until the extraction comes. If your area(s) go down to 0% HP, then you will not be able to be extracted and therefore, will have to restart. The other mode, called Objective, is where you (and your teammates) will have to do certain objectives leading to extraction. The objectives range from blowing up something to placing certain objects somewhere. There are 2 difficulties as well, one called Classic, and one called Casual.\n    \nClassic is where you spawn with nothing, and you don't spawn at all when you die unless a major objective is completed or a wave is completed. Casual is where you will always spawn with a melee weapon, and you have respawn tokens. You have 3 when you join/start, but every 10 zombie kills will earn you a token. Each token will allow you to spawn in 5 seconds near a player when you die. \n     \nThere are 3 zombie types in the game. The most common is slow, walking zombies. These guys just walk very slowly and attack if you get close. Be careful though, because these are common they can swarm you if your not careful. Less common is running zombies, which don't appear too often in the game. These guys run towards you very fast and sometimes require good timing to take down. The last is child zombies, which are basically childs that are zombies. These little guys are slower then runners, but faster then slow zombies. They will attack you, and it will not do that much damage but they can attack fast and can be a pain. They have a lower hitbox therefore requires you to aim a bit down to hit them. They have less health too and will usually die by one or two hits by a melee or gun to the head.\n\nThe game, overall, is really fun, especially with friends to play it with. The game, at first, may seem really hard to play, as guns and ammo are scarce, and melee you have the risk of getting hurt while striking. However, as you get more used to it, the game will turn out to be much easier. It is good to read the players survival guide for the game by clicking where it is located at the right where it says \"Players Survival Guide\" when you play the game at first, or if you need to be reminded about something. \n\nThere is a good range of guns and melee weapons you can find, and even get achievements for getting certain amount of kills with them. The game's engine is the Source Engine, which means that the game might be similar to Valve games such as TF2 and CS, such as the Developer Console. There is a few glitches in the game which may seem to make the game easier or slightly break the game, however it doesn't seem like a major thing. Most games have glitches sometimes, so it's fine. The developers of the game are constantly working on adding new content and fixing glitches. The developers also interact with the community in forums, and such as get players' opinions on certain things, which is nice. It's also free to play!\n\n(TL;DR Really fun realistic zombie survival game that has multiple modes and zombie types that requires teamwork and coordination.)\n\nOverall, I rate this game 10/10.

"english", "review": "To be honest, not much should need to be said about why you should get this game. It's free! It has zombies! Those alone should be reason enough to TRY it. As for keeping it, well, that depends on your taste, but the quality of the game can't be disputed. I, personally, prefer games like this, which offer a more realistic approach to a much bloated genre of games that put far too much emphasis on wish fulfillment and not enough on making the things you do actually feel meaningful. Why do I want to be able to effortlessly cut down hordes of normal zombies and have only a few special ones pose any sort of threat to me? To me, that's not fun. THIS, however, is. EVERY zombie in a horde should be a threat; that's what makes hordes scary. Each one of them can potentially kill you, so fighting a horde is a long, slow, careful thing that has to be done, all while watching your back for other zombies approaching from another direction. Because of this, the game pretty much forces you to play smart, which means doing everything you can to avoid being tied down by a horde and having to fight that fight.\n\nMelee could use a bit of tweaking, as the smaller the weapon, the more useless it tends to be. Yes, you CAN kill zombies with your flashlight, but let's be honest: if you're having to rely on that, you're pretty much dead already.\n\nThe guns are pretty much as good as you can expect from a game like this, which is to say...pretty damned good. They funtion realistically (relatively; don't expect ARMA level stuff, here), even down to being able to unload them to keep their ammunition (when you drop a weapon without doing that, any ammo in it is going to remain in the gun), which can be used for different guns. True to life, ammo is not universally interchangeable. The ammo for an AR-15 (5.56x45) is different from that of the CZ-58 (7.62x39), which is also different from that of the Sako-85 (.308(7.62x51), etc. Each gun has a set caliber that it can use, and nothing else will work in it. This is a good thing. It makes ammo scarcity a real issue to deal with. Just finding ammo (which is already fairly uncommon), doesn't guarantee that you'll find ammo for that 92fs you picked up at the Spawn Point, and if you do, you don't know how much you'll get. A full box? Half a mag? Two rounds? Who knows? This game is full of the pressures of making snap-decisions based on unknown variables and trying to make them work with what you can find.\n\nBeyond that the only thing I can say is that it's infuriating to have people take it upon themselves to put you down whether you're infected or not, but that's a community issue. I get the idea behind having the mechanic, but in practice it's rage inducing. Nobody wants to be the guy who gets team-killed because some asshat in the game thinks he's Rick Grimes and that it's up to him to determine if you're infected or not, thus meaning that your gameplay can be routinely interrupted by people who fly by the seat of their virtual pants, prioritizing their fantasy of being in charge over your enjoyment of your own damn game. This can (for me, at least), lead to you intentionally trying to find a server that is empty so that you can just do shit without being constantly fucked over by other people, but that comes with its own problems, not the least of which is that it's pretty much always going to be a losing battle to try these maps on your own.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game -highly, even- but with a caveat: You will find assholes who ruin match after match; it's inevitable, and just lack of teamwork like you can find in most games is also going to make things less than fun at times. Weapons aren't created equal, and each and every one wants to be used a different way. You have to adapt your playstyle around the ones you find enjoyable to use, or what you can get your hands on, and learn to use them well.\nAlso, map your keys.

Having said that it only starts to become super fun after you understand the game concepts and realise this is not Left 4 Dead you are not a zombie killing machine. Often not it is much easier to walk past zombies than take them head on as most maps will keep spawning them and it starts to become less about killing the horde than about managing it. There is good variety in melee weapons and ranged. From the amazing sledgehammer to the borderline useless kitchen knife. Also infection is present in the game so when you get bit by a zombie there is an above average chance you will be infected and the only way to halt it is to get the pills or the extremely rare gene therapy to halt it entirely. The enemy types range from bog standard walkers to runners and infected children which run really quick but are easy to kill and it might sound sadistic but slamming a sledge hammer on a zombie childs head never gets old as the physics usually catapult them in the opposite direction as their heads explode. Anyway the zombie types serve their perpose and the game is a lot more grounded than most zombie games on the market. In other games you'll see zombies that jump everywhere or spit shit.

Teamwork is key in any hope for survival.  Yet again, selfishness is another alternative.\n\nDetailed Review:\n\nThe wait is finally over for anyone who has been searching for a free zombie fps game!  This game has just about every aspect of a normal zombie inspired game, but is free (unlike most).  Even though its free, the graphics don't suffer.  Also, there are different game modes you can play which allows for great replay value.  A downside to the game involves the community which will be addressed later on.  This game sure makes up for the install time.\n\nAs many of us know, free games can be... kind of... crappy.  From the graphics to the rough game play, free to play games can make you cringe.  This one, however, is not like those awful let downs.  No More Room In Hell offers average graphics and smooth game play for free.  You cannot say that about a lot of games now, even games that cost an arm and a leg.  If you are familiar to Garry's Mod, then those are the graphics you can expect (many props can be found in GMod).  As long as your internet is half decent, this game will run smoothly.  This is coming from me with 150 KB/s internet speed.  Loading is quick and downloads take a few minutes.\n\nThere is a surprising amount of replay value in this game.  Normally, free to play games don't offer a lot of playtime.  With No More Room In Hell, there are many game modes involved.  You can either survive several hordes of zombies or battle to be extracted by the military.  Another bonus to this game is the amount of achievements it has.  For anyone who is like me and loves getting achievements, this game is great for you.  You can get almost 100 achievements which will have you coming back to get more.  You can expect to find yourself playing countless hours on this game.\n\nThe only downside I see in this game is the player base.  By this I mean the people playing the game (obviously).  These people that you are playing with are supposed to be there to help you fight off the brain dead flesh eaters.  Instead, you can find yourself screaming your head off as your teammate becomes one of those brain dead morons.  This is not very common, but should be expected.  This game is best played with friends, as many zombie games are.  However, you really should expect those \u201ctrolls\u201d in all games.  Do not feed the trolls and move on.  Chances are they will just crawl back under the bridges from which they came.\n\nAll things considered, this game is really fun.  It is a real time killer that you will actually enjoy.  For anyone out there will poor internet or a bad computer, you can more than likely play this game with ease.  I hope this review helped you get an idea of the game.

At the start you will keep dying and dying over and over again. But as you play longer, you grasp the basic mechanics of the game, such as to always shove after melee and to wait for focus when using the Beretta or the .22.\n\nIn the end, you come out like Rick Grimes. Everybody praises you for being the immortal badass. But a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. You need to be a good leader and tell people what to do, or they'll start falling like flies and in the end you'll be on your own. Without any help, you'll eventually become overrun and cornered as you beat their skulls in one by one to the ever respawning wave of zombies. \n\nAnother thing is the concept of sacrifice. It is possible for one person to hold back the horde to protect the group, at the cost of their own life. There is no other game I know of that has such realism. Games become only as dramatic as this.\n\nThat's not to say NMRIH has no flaws. NMRIH in itself is a very good game, but like many others, it has a horrible community. 10 years screaming into the mic. Griefers who sabotage the game.

Your character isn't immune, he isn't special. He is an civilian trying to survive, you can get infected and after some time you will turn into one of them, effectivly hindering your teammates or even catching them on suprise. And yes, you will die, a lot. Some of my friends get bored after one match and I can see why.\n\nThe game has got a rather big skill factor that you will see when you play the game more. It's very well made and it feels extremely rewarding to complete a rather hard map. But when you start you have mostly have no idea what to do. You will die, and die, and die again. It's boring to lose and lose again. But if you stick long enough you will see what you are capable off. \n\nThe main game has 2 modes, NMO and NMS, lets start with NMO.\nNMO is a mode that is based around objectives, usally it's the left 4 dead style. Keep on moving until the end. But this game makes objectives random per game. On the same map you could be walking in a different section and doing different objectives then you did last time. Reducing repetitveness from this mode.\nNMS on the other hand is more about defending [b] Zones [/b] while searching for weapons and suplies as the waves come at you. This is possible to do solo but this mode will be A LOT more easy if you got a friend or more to help you out. I think this mode is harder then NMO because you are more dependend on your team. You can't just run away if everything fails. You got a zone to protect.\n\nNow to the soundtrack in this game. It's a solid 10/10 for a free game and It is AMAZING. The soundtrack will fill you with despair, horror, but also hope when near the end.

Overall a great experience that mainly focusses on two modes. Objective mode where you have to traverse a set of objectives with slightly different item locations/objectives on other playthroughs and Survival mode where you have to survive waves of the undead while protecting a base before getting evacuated.\n\nWhat seperates this game from any other zombie shooting game is the little tweaks that make this game more \"real\" and harder to play on first tries. First off it's impossible to kill all the zombies in Objective mode, you have to find a way around them or kill a majority with melee weapons before proceeding. Your inventory is limited, you never know when you need those bandages or if a few extra bullets will prevent the bleeding through shooting.\n\nYou can get infected and you can fend the infection off with pills, putting a timer on your actions. You have to look at your ammo count to see how much ammo you have and what ammo type you need for your gun. So randomly picking up ammo with your limited space is not a viable option.\n\nAlso even if you are experienced with this game you WILL die sometimes, you can get bitten 3 times and nothing can happen but the smallest slip can let you get infected. And the faster infected look like the rest so their arrival can be unpredictable. There are enough spaces in the maps where being caught alone certainly means death.\n\nOverall this is a great experience, for the same price you can stare at a brick wall or play League of Legends.

I, myself am not a free to play type of person, in fact I think most, 90% of free-to-plays are absolute shit designed to try and suck money out of me. Not this one, this is up there in some of my favorite f2p games, and yes, I'll admit, this game isn't without it's flaws but it's one game that has semi changed my opinion on Free-to-Play.\n\nLet me start with the good, for a Source Game, an engine of 10+ years, this game looks great, apart from zombies looking like they came out of a low budget B-movie horror flick and the no texture bug which appears on the eyes of some characters (I laugh this one away and think of it as an intended bug for immersion) it's pretty good. In some of the settings, they've hidden away a few graphics options that are experimental such as Lens Flare but is worth enabling. NMRiH really immerses you into the thought that you are a survivor and must get through this with it's graphics, the vanilla maps have been designed very well for immersion in mind. The lighting creates this bleak atmosphere that not many other Survival Horror games create, Left 4 Dead (yes the lighting is still very good but not like NMRiH in any way), DayZ to name a few. It keeps to a certain design framework that really wants to keep you immersed and constantly on alert as every dark corner there may be undead lurking. It emphases the use of Flashlights which are possibly one of the best utilities seen in any game I've played. \n\nAway from the Atmosphere and the Graphics, the combat matches this very well. Ammo for guns is rare, something that really does fit a realistic scenario of such a thing happening and it requires you to make every shot count. Melee combat is interesting too as it has an invisible stamina meter, requiring you to time your swings and make every bit of your energy count. Weapons like Sledgehammers, FUBARs and Shovels drain it more but with the chance of one hit kills and possibly killing multiple zombies, other weapons, like Machetes, Hatchets, don't do as much damage but use little stamina, keeping you on in the fight. That moves me onto the next great thing about this game, the variety of weapons and how they each have a destined purpose. Pistols are great, they're all different and have their own specialties. The Beretta M9 is a 9mm Pistol and the ammo is rather common, it's a 2 hit kill and my favorite pistol due to the sights being better than that of the other 9mm, the Glock 17 which has a larger ammo capacity but worse sights, again in my opinion. Weapons are so varied with it's uses that they're all worth trying to match your game style. Would you like to pick up the M16 or would you rather take a more recyclable approach with a Compound Bow. \n\nOther mechanics in this game away from combat is the ability to become infected and must be warded off with Phlanx Pills (a reference to one of my all time favorite novels by Max Brookes - World War Z) or Gene Therapy, which completely cures you. You can barricade entrances with a claw hammer and some wooden planks, end your teammates (or yourself) to rid them of the burden that may encumber you later in game and more. You can even change your character and his voice. I'm not going to go much more in detail with the other mechanics, these are the best ones, so you'll have to encounter some of the other ones in game yourself. \n\nThis section is dedicated to the AI and the Level Design. I'm not gonna lie, the AI really needs patching up, it's fucking retarded and needs some work. However it's predictable and unpredictable nature (yes the AI is both) keep you on constant alert. An infected teammate has gone down, where the hell could he be? Well he's glitched out running in circles around where you turned. That's one major issue with the game. Away from AI, the levels are really good. If you're playing slowly, they can sometimes take up to 30 minutes to complete and can be quite the blast if you're last man standing. The maps, each and every one of them are unique and require different objectives and many of them have different paths for different playthroughs. Not major though, but something to change up gameplay each time. \n\nAll in all NMRiH is a great F2P game, a slightly cancerous community as I've encountered many annoying little kids in my mere 30 hours of gameplay but overall pretty damn good. 8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1465597875, "timestamp_updated": 1465597875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.79685211181640625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22402085": {"recommendationid": "22402085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190835122", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479755915}, "language": "english", "review": "*Joins random sever\n*Finds weapons\n*Kid screams in mic saying this game is scary\n*Gets attack by zombie\n*Bleeding\n*Ask kid for bandage \n*Kid types in chat how bad I am at this game\n*Leaves me to bleed out\n*Dies\n*Dead body turns into zombie\n*Attacks and rapes kid\n*Kid leaves server\n*Would watch my zombie self kill again", "timestamp_created": 1460583830, "timestamp_updated": 1460583830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 88, "votes_funny": 191, "weighted_vote_score": "0.801253557205200195", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34910244": {"recommendationid": "34910244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062398250", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1523719751}, "language": "english", "review": "\"GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE WAY\"\n\"OH MY FUCKING GOD\"\n\"oh you're infected, huh?\"\n*SHOTGUN BLAST*\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1505259197, "timestamp_updated": 1505259197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 46, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736559092998504639", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16603484": {"recommendationid": "16603484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068604864", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 8789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1528118236}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a new genre of zombie games (at least to me anyway) the game is unforgiving and and slow which makes this game unique. The maps are originally very bare with just enough weapons for 8 people (max per server), weapons are the standard melee or firearms, however, given the unforgiving nature of this game, you may not have enough bullets in your gun to protect you from the various zombies you will encounter, including runners, walkers, crawlers, children, and armoured zombies. Your best bet on survival is top notch accuracy and the ability to use all types of melee weapons (including your fists).\n\nThere are 3 different game difficulties that you can choose from when looking for a server; classic mode, casual mode and modded.\n\n-Classic mode: Can be divided into two types which are, objective and wave maps. Objective maps require the player(s) to complete objectives all over the map before they can be extracted. Wave maps are straight forward, survive all the waves to get extracted. If you die during a wave, with no respawn tickets, you will automatically respawn at the start of the next wave.\n\nWith both game types, consecutive kills with no deaths is rewarded in respawn tickets.\n\n\n\n-Casual mode: Similar to classic, however, the player spawns with a random melee weapon in-hand and start off with 3 respawn tickets. Players are also spawned at any point in the game whether it be an objective or wave map.\n\nNew players may want to join these types of game types as they are easier to get accustomed to and learn the ways of the zombieslayer.\n\n\n\n-Modded: Personally, I find this very lacking, repetetive and boring. Modded servers usually provide players with infinite ammo and all weapons. This gametype is usually played by those who are somehow very bad at the game.

And frankly this was my first survival horror game. I started playing on casual servers. Then after developing my skills, I started playing on classic. \nNow, I got left for dead one and two for free because my brother have them and he shared his account with me. Surprisingly, the game that got me into NMRIH in the 1st place is no longer interesting for me because NMRIH is so much better. Yes, a free to play game that is not that famous is so much better than the famous purchasable Left 4 Dead series. \n\nWhy? Because this game makes everything feels real. Simply, in this game, you have to make decisions about how to make the best use of teamwork and the supplies you have. It is not a run and shoot game.\n\nAdditionally, mastering the game is challenging but can be frustrating. With friends, mastering the game is challenging and so much fun.

That would be awesome, I'll give them a 9/10 but only because a couple of the models had texture issues.\n\n\nThe game modes and maps, there are 2 game modes, a classic survival mode and a more linear objective mode, both are great, tbh I don't know which I like more, Survival mode is easier but Objective mode feels more like a normal game. most if not all of the maps that come with the game are excellent and most fan made ones are good or at least decent there's even a Night of The Living Dead and Day of the Dead map (with a Bub cameo), there is a mall map too but it isn't the mall from Dawn of the Dead but that's ok, the maps provide great atmosphere with help from the music which is also pretty good and atmospheric, I must say bravo developers bravo indeed, another big prop I have to give this game is that it allows you to play by yourself, the last game I played didn't and that sucked, I don't always want to play with people and in the zompocalypse sometimes..Hell a lot of times you'd probably be on your own. 10/10\n\n\n\nThe weaponry and other items, The weapons in this game are great and pretty various, everything from a kitchen knife to an Automatic shotgun to 3 seperate types of Grenades are in this game, while there isn't a ton of gun variaty there is enough to keep everyone happy and even have several player preferences, it even has a bow and arrow which is easily one of the best but hardest weapons to use. Other items include Flashlights, Hammers and Boards to board up doorways and windows, and medical supplys such as first aid kits to heal, bandages to stop bleeding damage, pills to stave off infection for a decent time and a sort of Anti-zombie epipen that completly cures you of the virus, all of these items play an essential role in surviving, there aren't so many items that it gets confusing but there's also not a lack of items either, there is just enough, another pro of items is that you can't use them if you don't need them, this saves players from wasting stuff which is great, 10/10\n\n\nGameplay and mechanics, there aren't many noticable mechanics tbh, it's mostly your typical FPS, grab a weapon, aim, and fire, use items when needed, and do whatever you have to do to survive, the few mechanics that are fresh and somewhat original are being able to board up doors and windows, this is a great mechanic and nice throw back to Night of The Living Dead, another interesting mechanic is that you can hit a button to check your ammo, literally your character takes the clip out and will say how much ammo is left very nice touch, the final and pretty unique mechanic I like is that you have the option to blow your brains out, if you hit K while holding a gun your character will put it under their chin, everything gos pretty quiet, press the mouse button and BAM! you commit suicide, I gotta say this is fantastic game design for 2 reasons, 1 because in the zompocalypse a lot of people would do this, whether out of fear of trying to survive or being cornered by zombies and not wanting to be eaten alive, or because of infection and not wanting to turn. 2 because most games wouldn't have the balls to put this mechanic in, it's a very dark thing most devs wouldn't want in their games, luckily this is a mod game and doesn't have to follow most video game ettiquete.\n\n\n\nOverall this is probably one of if not THE best FPS zombie game I have ever played, I love everything about it, it's basic but not too basic, it isn't perfect things in the game could be expanded on but as it stands now it's a very solid game, I've seen big name game companys put out games MMMUUUUUUUCH worse than this in the past 6 or 7 years alone, I highly encourage zombie fans to play this and I also highly encourage the Devs to keep working on this game, with enough support this could become a big game, I'd rate it 11/10, I think George would be proud of this game, if he were still alive and knew of this game he might even support it, R.I.P George Romero.", "timestamp_created": 1503550290, "timestamp_updated": 1503550894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.711522936820983887", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32184977": {"recommendationid": "32184977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045862275", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497342830}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like zombies, shooting, objectives, and having teamwork be a key role of survival, then this game is just for you.", "timestamp_created": 1496609836, "timestamp_updated": 1496609836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705882370471954346", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30603611": {"recommendationid": "30603611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043957660", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1537920527}, "language": "english", "review": "A great free zombie survival game with a slower pace, dark atmosphere and lethal combat despite the limitations of the ageing source engine. \n\nIt effectively does what it sets out to do.

You can do objective style games like left 4 dead, or you can do pure survival (my favourite). The servers are great, you can really test your self with a straight up survival feel, finding guns and weapons on the floors and dividing ammo like a team. Or you can just spawn guns and unlimited ammo, hell go god mode if you want the wide range of servers allow it all!

Intent on creating as realistic (or, in the words of the developer, \"Romero-style\") an experience as possible, nearly everything is accounted for in this game, outside of the usual \"stamina\" and \"limited HUD\" features. Each individual item has its own weight, and is allocated to an inventory wheel, which the player can access at any time. A shotgun, for example, will weigh more than a machete (and consequently, take up more space than that machete on the wheel). Even your total ammount of ammunition is accounted for, and thusly limits your inventory space. Don't take this to be an inhibiting feature, though. If anything, this system adds to the terrifying immersion of the game. Certain items that are normally a \"given\", such as the flashlight, must be picked up manually to be used at all (but can be accessed quicker than other items by the usual 'F' key once it's picked up). The zombies themselves, as they always have in Romero's movies, are generally slow, and do not pose any threat if they're alone. As you progress through the waves, however, this \"lone target\" situation becomes decreasingly common, and replaced with crowds of zombies, often numbered in the tens to even twenties. Unlike other horror (or even generalized co-op) games that permit cooperation but do not enforce it, No More Room in Hell sternly (but not forcefully) nudges players into a peacefully-woven experience, complete with suppressing and covering fire, shared supplies, and coordinated strategy.\n\ntl;dr - No More Room in Hell is one of the best zombie games you'll find this decade.

It nails almost every aspect that makes a zombie game terrifying (lots of gore, difficult to kill enemies, relatively frail characters, scarce weapons and ammo, claustrophobia, reanimation, etc.). It's quite impressive how the developers were able to create such a great game, out of the relatively old Source Engine and without any financing whatsoever (except for their paid sountrack).\n\nI will now list the pros and cons of the game:[/b]\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n\n\u2022 Spectacular atmosphere, where horrible sights are abundant.\n\u2022 Great objective-based maps that alternate between different sets of objectives to complete in order to finish a level.\n\u2022 Very good soundtrack, mixing tension and desolation with its electronic vibe.\n\u2022 Satisfying combat feel and mechanics\n\u2022 Simple and functional co-op: the more players there are, the easier it gets to complete the objectives, and zombies don't focus on only one player. Also, helping other people to get past a horde, healing them, preventing them from becoming a walking corpse, feels great, as well as when they help you in return.\n\u2022 Zombies are disgusting, very dangerous and hard to kill, making you hate the moment they grab you, or when they decide to swing their arms at you. The sheer number of them helps build the desperation in the player's mind.\n\u2022 The inclusion of zombie children is nice, because it helps with immersion and realism, as well as freaking the player out.\n\u2022 Scarcity of weapons and ammo keep the tensions high, especially when there are 8 players in the server.\n\u2022 Both firearms and melee weapons are very satisfying to use and pack a punch.\n\u2022 The minimalistic HUD is excellent and surprisingly comfortable to use.\n\u2022 Bleeding and infection are some good game mechanics that up the difficulty and realism\n\u2022 Realism mode on co-op is hard but very, very thrilling to play, once you have the skill for it.\n\u2022 Nightmare difficulty is brutal and unforgiving. A paradise for adrenaline junkies.\n\u2022 Some of the achievements are really good and can prove a real challenge, like \"We Got This!\" or the speedrun achievements.\n\u2022 Even after completing all objective maps several times and learning all the tricks, it's still a thrill to complete most of them. As an extra challenge, you can try finishing every objective map on your own, which feels like a fantastic accomplishment (for example, \"nmo_brooklyn\").\n\u2022 An abundance of free, fan-made maps can keep you entertained for a long time, because many of them are really hard (namely, underground, subside, sweden, urbanhazard, in_the_dark, anxiety, ghostbuster, ravenholm, emergency, torn, camilla, house_of_forester, and many more).\n\u2022 It's free to play, as if everything before that wasn't enough for you to try it out.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n\n\u2022 It's still a mod, so some clunkyness, bugs and glitches will be present at all times, breaking some of the immersion.\n\u2022 Although satisfying, the combat is finicky and requires some serious practice and experience to fully dominate.\n\u2022 Hit detection is bugged. Pushing, melee hits and shots don't register consistently.\n\u2022 Runners, the biggest source of challenge in the game, are very exploitable, they lack attack animations when running, you can basically kite them all on your back while walking.\n\u2022 The random chance of infection can be incredibly frustrating, especially when you get infected on your first bite, and you are in the begining of a really long map, like nmo_anxiety. Yes, the chance increases the lower your health is, but I've had many instances where I got infected on full health, first bite, and others where I could finish hard maps like nmo_underground_a9 having been bitten many times on low health, and showing no signs of infection.\n\u2022 Objective maps can be broken with ease. Just throw a vital item over a fence and you're done, no more progress. This is a problem that server admins, have to face many times, and I, personally, punish players severely for breaking objective maps.\n\u2022 Survival maps tend to be somewhat boring and stale, not to mention how easy it is to beat them with 5-ish players, unless Realism is enabled, but very hard to solo them. Also, they are very laggy when playing online, where more than 100 zombies can spawn at a time.\n\u2022 The tutorial is limited to an image of the main keyboard controls during the loading screens, which isn't the best way to teach players. It all ends up in a good old trial and error type of learning curve. No info on game mechanics, like charging your melee weapon, whatsoever.\n\u2022 Zombie models lack variety which breaks the realistic gameplay to some degree. It's kind of dumb when you encounter the same old man zombie for the tenth time on a single map. Also, there are only two skins available for zombie children.\n\u2022 Third person character animations are a little bit funky. Walk, run and melee attack cycles are stiff.\n\n[b]So, do I recommend No More Room in Hell? DEFINITELY. If you like zombie/co-op/FPS games, this is one of the best I've seen, and it's really impressive for a mod. Even if you're not particularly excited about zombies, but you're into horror games, you will love this one. If you can look past all the bugs, which are not as noticeable as I made them look in the review, then you're in for a treat. This review is also a personal opinion based on my experience with the game (no less than 2000 hours), so it's ok if you end up disagreeing with me. I won't give a numeric rating, because I think that no review will guarantee that you'll like or dislike a game, you have to try it out for yourself.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1428201360, "timestamp_updated": 1548090113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.72554779052734375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18548671": {"recommendationid": "18548671", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101256398", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513464891}, "language": "english", "review": "Where can I start:\n\nGreat Graphics\nLow Hardware requirements\nVarious maps that are balanced for the modes they offer\nGood ammount of weapons and ammo types\nGood AI and gameplay\nAll of this for free (might not be much for a couple guys, but it's free so, it's allot)\n\nThe only negative issue I could point out is the fact that the community might not be as willing to team work as you, a bunch of idiots going around getting bitten by zombies, etc etc. If you wanna win or have some random fun, get some friends, otherwise, just try to help your team.", "timestamp_created": 1445174408, "timestamp_updated": 1445174408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667844891548156738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13123453": {"recommendationid": "13123453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115633391", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433582535}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!\nFor a free game its an awesome game, the game is better than games that cost money\nHighly recommended", "timestamp_created": 1417190233, "timestamp_updated": 1417190233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.766494154930114746", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40569914": {"recommendationid": "40569914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142788303", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512059211}, "language": "english", "review": "If you guys are fan of zombie survival, you shall download it.

Well this for one is very fun to play and I definetly recommend this to anyone who is wanting to experience a zombie, survival, strategy and immersive style of game. \n\nThere are 2 basic mods for you to play in, 1 being a survival game mode. You start off typically in a house or not depending on what map you choose, and you have to scavenge for tools, weapons and materials in order to survive (Hence the name survival). There are waves in this game mode - Starting with wave 1, once you kill all the zombies that have spawned wave 2 will commence (Waves getting more difficult as you progress). More zombies, more lethal zombies such as running zombies and runnings kids.. Yes I said it. RUNNING ZOMBIE KIDS are in this game which makes the gaming experience 10x better already, they are harder to kill as you often don't see them coming and they run fast as hell. Inflicting harder hits than your normal average zombie. (So watch out for those little fuckers).\n\n2nd game mode is objective. You start off with nothing in your inventory, having to find melee weapons such as machete, chainsaw, sledgehammer, knifes, crowbars and so on. All of these weapons have different swing times and damage outputs (bigger heavier weapons doing more damage but slower swing). You can find guns whether they be automatic, semi auto, bolt action, 3 round burst but nothing crazy like a minigun, RPG or grenade launcher. However you can find grenades and molotovs also a Bow. You are given the 1st objective such as find a key to unlock the door, you then have to proceed to the next objective getting more difficult as you progress through the map until you reach the end where your picked up and saved. \n\nThe actual game itself: Finally getting to the point here bare with me. There is no Hud or mini map when your playing so it becomes very immersive, the only sense of whereabouts you are is the compass you rely on. There's markers on the compass pointing to the direction of the next objective. Sometimes none at all if it says 'you must find (an item) to proceed through the gate/ barrier' for example. You can run, walk, crouch but no prone. As you run or jump alot your stamina will run out causing your character to be out of breath and only able to walk slow. You can select different looking characters (none altering your play style) and can choose from a selection of voices. There are in game voice commands you can say.\n\nWhether you play solo or co-op is upto you, the max number of players is 8 in a game. The average zombie walks slow and hits slow but don't be fooled by their behaviour! as you can soon overwhelmed by hordes of hundreds. Running zombies are not common but not rare to find, make sure you shove them away asap causing them to stumble, but inflicting no damage. If one bites onto you there is a chance you may become INFECTED. Meaning you have to find pills to delay the time it takes for you to become a zombie. As you 'turn' vains will appear on your screen and it will darken until you rise from the dead. You then turn into a running zombie. If you can't bear the guilt of turning into a zombie ofcourse you can turn the gun to yourself.\n\nFinding different guns will require different types of ammo. The more items you hold the heavier your bagpack (Inventory) will become, noticeable via a weapon wheel filling up with items. If you want to pick up a heavy item such as a sledgehammer and your bagpack is only filled half way, you might not be able to pick it up as it's very heavy and takes up alot of space in your bagpack. There is no food or drink level to your character.\n\nThere are many different interesting maps to play, forest, dark forest, prison, research facilitys, military bases and 1 more importantly i'd like to mention. A particular map called 'Toxteth' is in the game which I thought was just a coincidence but it wasn't. Its based on a street in liverpool in an area called Toxteth. Where I was partially brought up. It's based on Harrington Road by Toxteth cemetry where i'm very familiar with. I dont know why the game makers decided to make a map based in this place but i'm guessing it's to make it look like the riots we had back in 1981. The street layout itself looking disturbingly familiar to how it does in real life. \n\nBad qualities I HAVE to mention are:\n1. Game graphics aren't the best\n2. Wall textures on some maps can visibly break and look purple\n3. Mod servers with unlimited ammo and health ruin the game - My personal opinion\n4. No tutorial making it a little difficult for new players to understand the game. My best advice? stay close to others and mess with your settings before you find a game\n5. Because of a slightly higher learning curve, new players become dis-interested quickly. Stick with the game!\n\nAll considered this is one Hell of a game and most importantly it's free!", "timestamp_created": 1528658234, "timestamp_updated": 1528658234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.754245400428771973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36220067": {"recommendationid": "36220067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152451135", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516920314}, "language": "english", "review": "Gather your friends on Steam and play this game, it's not a recommendation.\n\n\n\nIt's an obligation.", "timestamp_created": 1509637560, "timestamp_updated": 1509637560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.754723072052001953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24288765": {"recommendationid": "24288765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048070885", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1531920017}, "language": "english", "review": "Suicide had never been so dramatic.\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1468384479, "timestamp_updated": 1468465058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 50, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758917748928070068", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26097316": {"recommendationid": "26097316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279631650", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495799392}, "language": "english", "review": "rather accurate simulation of actual zombies, balanced guns, balanced zombies, \"challenging\" puzzles  (like the thing where you have to use a blowtorch to unlock a gate) and overall very fun to play.

I've met a lot of amazing people since, and about two thirds of my Steam friend list is now NMRIH-players. As any other game it has its flaws, but they are few and my experience with this one has been nothing but positive, honestly. The maps are creative, and there's servers for everyone, whether you want to play objective maps or survival maps (with waves of zombies). Some even play on servers without zombies and with friendly fire on, as some kind of death match. There's a variety of weapons as well, everything from an ordinary hammer or a kitchen knife to things like a chainsaw, a m16 or a compound bow. The community is great, with few exceptions (you may stumble upon some annoying, toxic and/or selfish people when you play with others - there's no getting away from that - but luckily it happens very rarely in this game).
