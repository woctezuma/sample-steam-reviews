The many skills involved in this game are aesthetically pleasing when executed correctly and the tactics (on defense or offense) are fun and proven to be even challenging at times. As one of the rare multiplayer \"Free to Play\" sports games, It could have easily been top of the Twitch streams daily, had they been managed by a competent company.\n\n I wont even touch the actual gameplay bugs or meta issues for this review, but something else I believe many new potential players need to adhere to.\n\nFirstly, this game has the most disgusting P2W model I've ever seen point blank and period.\n\nIf you pay for the features in this game, you are getting a substantial advantage over other players who don't. Kind of like a normal P2W game right? No. The bigger problem is that the game REQUIRES you to make a decently high investment (of around $100) in order to unlock the primary features of this game, and not owning them will SEVERELY limit your gameplay expirience. Features that come to mind (but i know for a fact I'm missing more) are skill slots, clothing attributes, enhancements (the newest P2W feature), and CARDS. \n\nProbably, one of the most abhorrent P2W feature in this game is the \"Card\" system. Not only could you pay for cards (that are actually worth using, the common ones are objectively trash since the company purposely made it so) , but there is a RNG element that is HUGELY not in your favor to get good cards. It has been debunked on the forums and various steam discussion that the chance to get the cards your character needs are 0.1% (rounded)! Unfortunately, the RNG and P2W doesn't stop there! You now have to now PAY for REROLLS on the sub attributes cards have and hope to get subs that actually complement your character. This will take several rerolls for the general census and cost even MORE money on top of what you spent already. \n\n*To follow up on this, last week Joycity has made a nerf to the shooting performance of EVERY position and their base success rate. This means that if you don't have the Legendary or All star cards (The best cards in the game), your character will now miss even WIDE OPEN shots on a CONSISTENT basis.*\n\nSecondly, the community as a whole is a REALLY pathetic phenonmen to behold.\n\nThe people who would spend hundreds of dollars on a free game only so that they can have dominance over other players are sad (to say the least of course). \n\nThe people who spend hundreds and/or THOUSANDS of dollars to a company that does not give a complete sh!t about them and their fellow players (the spenders are aware and vocal about this) and JoyCity made it IMPLICATIVELY clear that they DO NOT care about whether or not they are returning customers by not addressing the several critical issues that the game has, yet STILL pay the company to feed on their elitism and insecurities are INSANE.\n\nThese players are not few and far between either. It's the MAJORITY of the playerbase who are abrasive, stuck up, tight knit, and arrogant about their status of being \"extravagant\" Pay to Win players. \n\nIf you still play this game after reading this, fair enough. Some people need to learn things first hand, but nonetheless I still feel obligated to warn anyone who is interested in this game:\n\nFreestyle 2 is a classic case of a potentially good game being ruined by a terrible company.\nOne of the worst communities I've been apart of. It's just straight toxcity, snobbery, and desolate.\nIt is dangerously easy to rack up an unecessary expense when playing this game.\nListen to those who made the mistakes so that now you wont have to make them.\n\nPlease comment below if you have any questions or even objections to what's been said.\n\nThanks for reading and have a great day.\n\nEdit 12/21: Muthafuca says, \"not sure how is this p2w.. ive been playing this game for years. havent spend a single dime and my character beats any cash players out there. and theres tons of events thats gives away a lot of free stuff like skills slots , sub attri cards , free spcs, free gcash. i dont get why people still complain. lol seriously..\"\n\nThis is something that I failed to mention. JoyCity DOES have periodic events that give away free stuff. However, Muthafuca fails to point out though that these events are for the MOST part TRASH (just look at the current events going on right now on the website). I'd like to also note that he does not object on my comment that sub attri cards are a fraud like feature. (I've personally won the 100 sub attri card lottery and still failed to get a good reroll). As a matter of fact, MuthaFuca did not even argue against ANY of the specific evidence that I have provided in this review. \nHis main objection is that; because he has accrued enough items and rewards from events over the years, his character was able to compete against \"cash players\" as a result of that, making the game NOT p2w. It's a weak counter arguement saying that because this game gives away rewards from events periodically (That are OBJECTIVELY bad among the community, the rewards that he specifically speaks of are EXTREMELY RARE) he \"can't see how this game is p2w\". It's actually bothersome if he read each point I made (I'm doubtful) on why IT IS p2w and still came to reach that conclusion.\n\n\n*Regardless, you still have to give credit where it's due. Giving away free stuff (bad or good) to the community is a generous act and I commend JoyCity for doing so.*", "timestamp_created": 1545258526, "timestamp_updated": 1547149036, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.748645901679992676", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22930871": {"recommendationid": "22930871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044816548", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 15240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499213148}, "language": "english", "review": "The first negative aspect is the toxicity of the game.

For new comers, this game is very fun, very appealing, very unique and very attractive. A free to play basketball game with cool skills and smooth animations. This game is very fun if you and your friends are bored and just want to mess around and try a new game. THis game will make you laugh and you will have a great time until you get hooked...\n2. After a few days of playing you start to get frustrated because you begin to lose even though you try and your random teammates begin to yell and are toxic at you. \n3. The community in this game is very very small, as you can see if you search up Freestyle 2: street basketball steam charts. Averaging around 1000 players, and this is spread amongst a few servers: N.A, Europe and Asia. \n4. This small community means you will play against the same players very very frequently. Additioanlly, many veteran players will create new characters so you are always versing the same players, just different characters. \n5. The game is slightly pay to win. You can easily drop $100 on this game if you play it often. Players may spend money on clothes that give stats like rebound, 3 point etc. Or they may spend money on a gamble to obtain legendary card sets which provide large stat bonuses.\n6. There is a really really big underlying problem that is hidden to new players and that is the server imbalance. THe N.A servers are on the west. Any players living on the west (California) get ~30ms ping. If you live central you get ~60ms. If you live east(New York) you get ~90ms. IF you live in south america you get ~100+ms(A.k.a you're screwed and don't play unless you like playing in the past compared to everyone else). Having a low ping offers really really big advantages in this game. If you are a PG and you have 10ms, you can outreb a center who has 90ms. \n7. Gamekiss is money hungry and always creates new events to make them profit, but never fixes bugs within the game. Events like \"SPend 50$ and get additional items\". Additioanlly, gamekiss frequently reuses events that have been created before but just with a different theme. Some examples include bingo, dice roll. And theses events encourage you to pay for extra dice rolls or extra bingo rolls. Some bugs that have been in the game for a long time that is never fixed is the F9 key. The f9 key resets the ball in a waiting room because sometimes the ball bugs and cannot be picked up. The fact that there needs to be an f9 key suggest that gamekiss does not really care about the game and the player experience. The ball should never bug out and need to be reseted. Additioanlly, there are many desyncs in skills. Players see different things happening on their screen compared to other players which causes lag blocks, lag steals, sliding.  And these desyncs have nothing to do with internet but rather the skill being used itself because the desync happens everytime someone uses the skill. (unless the coincidence is so great that each time the player uses the specific skill, backwards two step, their internet lags). \n8. The match making is extremely unfair, and this can be due to the fact that there's a small community so you always verse the same players.

This game is truly satisfying if you're a competition junky. You don't even have to like sport games to enjoy this game.  The gameplay and game mechanics all work well, untill that point where you hit level 24. As a beginner, I started out playing against other noobs and various pro players that had their smurf accounts in the rookie/major league. I had some epic losses, epic victories, various intense close point games that went into second overtime. \n\nEventually, I managed to get to level 25 with a 76% win percentage overall, I felt like a solid player that played his role ( PF ) well. In good matches, I'd block about every shot, bad matches I'd let a few slide.   All the fun in the game stopped though when I entered the  Pro League.\n\nMatch after match, you get to play against level 50 characters that not only have the most ridiculous skills that you could think, they also have so much experience that not in another 1000 matches could you hope to destroy them. They also have, in almost EVERY case, dropped over 200-300 euros on cash shop roulette style items that grant bonus stats, cards and card upgrades that grant..bonus stats, extra skill slots, etc.  You name it.\n\nSo in quick summary. You might love the game in the beginning, you might think you're a genius rookie player destroying the alt characters of pros. But once you actually get to the pro league, prepare to bend over and take it, over and over again untill you yourself are level 44-50 and have unlocked all the skills + slots. Surely by that time, you would also have dropped atleast 60 euros on the game.", "timestamp_created": 1428592112, "timestamp_updated": 1428592112, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 192, "votes_funny": 31, "weighted_vote_score": "0.797944724559783936", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30404190": {"recommendationid": "30404190", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964963951", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491583191}, "language": "english", "review": "This is from the perspective of a new player - i've played a couple hours or so of FSBB2 and here's my honest review. \n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] It's essentially 3-on-3 basketball. If you love basketball as a sport and as a game, this right here is it! \n\n[*] Simple at the start, gets more complex as you gain levels and \"skills\". This includes player skill as well as actual skills that you buy for your character ingame. \n\n[*] Additionally, customization is great. Loads of costumes, the ability to pick your skills to do stunts with, as well as \"freestyle\" skills, which you can think of as EX moves which use meter in fighting games;  do enough in a match and they become available for you to use. Cards are also a part of customization, you can load up cards that help you with certain statistics. On level up, you get to distribute points to certain characteristics as well, further making your character truly unique.\n\n[*] Positions function as classes in this game. There're primarily offensive positions and defensive positions, as well as assist positions. All of them are viable, though some are more preferred than others. This gives some distinction between characters but as mentioned in the previous point, you can make your character have strengths that are adverse to contemporary assumptions. (A 3-pt shooting center? Why not?)\n\n[*] Personal preference, but I like the aesthetic and music. It's fitting with the style of FSBB2.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n\nOh dear, here we go.\n\n[list]\n[*] Perhaps the most destructive aspect of the game is the community. Predominantly filled with Filipino, Thai, and Indonesian players, English fails to become the primary language in this game. The community is very exclusive in nature, and unless you're part of their culture, you'll be isolated and alienated. Furthermore, many players are extremely toxic in nature, playing the game only to win. They'll personally admonish weaker players as soon as they make a mistake, and they take absurd pride in their own abilities even though they make mistakes as well. You wanna destroy a multiplayer game? This exclusive, toxic-filled community is how your game dies. \n\n[*] Pay-to-win. If you're a F2P player, be prepared to lose. A lot. Unless your team has veteran players or Pay2Win players, there's absolutely a slim margin chance of you ever beating your opponent, especially if they're Pay2Play. The greatest example I can give is that basic stats become skyrocketed the moment you have buffed equipment on. These equipment buffs are equivalent to around 30ish player levels at least, and that's not including the card and pet system as well. Between players of equal skill, the one with P2P equipment will always, ALWAYS win. That's just the nature of the beast. You'll be outrebounded, out blocked, out scored (your blocks will become ineffective). \n\n[*] Lack of a \"skill-less\" channel. You know, the above point can be completely circumvented by the addition of one simple thing - channels that remove all additional buff stats (but lets everyone keep a set number of skills). With this, everyone can play on an equal level. People will be forced to play with others outside their circle and the community will be more accepting. The only drawback with this server is that GameKiss will fail to make any form of profit from it. Who doesn't want to be overpowered?\n\n[*] This is a stretch - but recent games like Overwatch have added special \"swear filters\" that replace the swear words with text to bemean the aggressor. A lack of such a system here (seriously, does anyone even use the report function) allows players to be as toxic and as horrible as they want without any repercussions. \n\nTo be honest, I cannot see myself even reaching level 50 in this game with the current drawbacks. As I level more, the players become more unforgiving and loathing. It's embarassing to even be associated with them and their culture - I routinely kick toxic players from my team even though they may be performing well and giving me wins.\n\nI do love this game, and I can spend HOURS practicing my skillsets on my own - it's just that as a multiplayer game, the community is absolute garbage and leaves me wanting nothing more. \n\nFood for thought: why is it that SEA communities are always incredibly idiotic and taxing to play with? Most of them are asshats and ruin the multiplayer experience for everybody.", "timestamp_created": 1489044302, "timestamp_updated": 1489044354, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.703481853008270264", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38361593": {"recommendationid": "38361593", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998359809", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 104240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1595, "last_played": 1551815009}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll be honest, this game is alot of fun.\nBUT, and theres a HUGE but in the end there;\nThis game is pure P2W, in the first 24 levels you'll be mostly facing normal non-p2w players but than it all begin.\nIn the level 24+ channel you'll face characters that you basicly got no chance against, for example, a normal PF should have about 200-210 rebound in level 24+.\nYou will probably face a 230+ reb gkash P2W users who will just ruin the whole game for you.\n\nThose who say this game is not P2W just dont know this game.\nI got enough time on it to easily say, I do not recommend it unless you dont mind spend 40-60$ every couple of months.\n\nP.S: I would like to mention that \"Special Characters\" are achieveable thro' normal playing metods but still the fact that you may face somone who bought himself a huge boost of rebound or lets say 3pt stats is just making it P2W.\nIt is still fun if you dont mind the difference.", "timestamp_created": 1513461916, "timestamp_updated": 1515325747, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.730374395847320557", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15261282": {"recommendationid": "15261282", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030932351", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451576083}, "language": "english", "review": "Bear with me as this is my first game review on Steam:\n\nPros:\n- Great customization (Skills, Freestyle variability, Clothing, Stat allocation)\n- Requires teamwork (Heavy)\n- Crew matches (Like GvG in MMORPGs)\n- Easy to pick up, Hard to master\n\nCons:\n- Community can be toxic (Will explain more later)\n- You can pay for stats\n- Fluid gameplay relies heavily on latency (ping)\n\nFreestyle2 is a great Multiplayer Online 3v3 Streetball game that pleases my thirst for basketball games.\nIt is very easy to pick up (You only use direction keys + 4 basic keys + 2 or 3 more for specific skills),\nbut hard to master.\n\nIt relies moderately on basketball knowledge, such as actual basketball tactics like Pick and Roll, which can be executed in the right situation. To win, you will have to try your best to fulfill your one of five (C, PF, SF, SG, PG) position's purpose.\n\nPositions and their roles are generalized in FreeStyle2, although adventurous stat allocation may lead to fun and creative plays (like improving 3 pointers success rate on C or PFs). \n\nC: Rebounding and blocking, setting up plays under the paint\nPF: Similar to C, but takes an offensive role\nSF: All-rounder (Dunk, rebound, middle jumper, 3s)\nSG: Also an all-rounder with heavier emphasis on 3s\nPG: Playmaker (Passing and loose ball grabbing)\n\nPlaying the position that fits you and doing it right comes with a great rewarding feeling.\nAlso, there are many team compositions which are strong, but you will run into hell lot of weird ones online (Triple Cs)\n\nIf you aren't good at what your position is supposed to be doing by Major (past level 11), you will most likely be dealt with offensive words, telling you that you suck and that you should quit.\n\nThe playerbase isn't large enough to have the greatest matchmaking system and tiers - and this is why sometimes you will face teams that will totally shit on your face. Knowing your position and having individual skills is very important in this game and when a single teammate is not pulling their own weight, it shows definitely. \n\nI highly suggest trying each of the 5 positions before moving onto Major (level 11+)\n\nYou can pay for extra stats (btw you can also do this for free, but not as much). \nDoes it help? Yeah, I guess.\nDoes it win games? Maybe - it makes minimal difference.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nLet's say a player purchased items and also obtained cards to improve his 3 pointers.\nIf you are guarding him perfectly, he won't score any 3 pointers.\nIf you don't and give him open shots on 3s, you should really blame yourself.\n\nTeamwork (Strategy, Individual talent, knowing how each other reacts in certain situations) is much much much much holy freaking so much more important and impactful than stats.\n\nGamekiss will be adding controller support very soon, and I am so excited for that!\n\nGive this game a try.

This is not NBA basketball,this is street Basketball,which basically means 3v3 on one court 5 minute basketball matches,no fouls,no overtimes,no free throws. The gameplay is really fun,addictive and easy to understand,but hard to master. There are 5 classes for you to choose,plus 3 more if you want an advanced class of sorts. The game has MMORPG elements such as skills(fade away,double clutch etc)and things like tricks that can be used for doing 3pts or dunks or blocks (Twister,The Shot,etc). Plus you have a level up system,which awards with attribute points so you have better chances of doing 3pts dunks or blocks.\n\nBut once you realize the faults of this game,you are better off uninstalling it.\n\nFirst off,the game is Pay-to-Win-ish,a F2p game for me should have at least micro-transactions for cosmetics and stuff like that,not for special characters like point guard son goku over there.\n\nSecond,the game has a lot of bugs,connection issues,freezes,which need to be fix ASAP.\n\nThird,the community i say is more like CS:GO's and LOL's community long lost son who was adopted by an Asian. It's filled with ungrateful assholes,12 year old's who say that they are fucking your mom,and just toxicity all around. And it dosen't help that once you leave rookie and have an unbalance between veteran players and rookies (basically think of it as a Team of LVL 12 novices vs LVL 50 veterans)\n\nFourth. BITCOIN MINER\n\nFifth. HACKERS. I have at least spotted 3 hackers in 3 games. If this doesn't get fixed,it will be S4 League all over again.\n\nIn conclusion,without the Hackers,the shitty community,the bugs,the Bitcoin Miner,and the skill gap when you leave rookie servers.

Maybe it could be a bit more balanced, but it's nice to see the game reward team play.\n\nOfcourse there are negative points too.\n\nNegative:\n- Paying actually makes you better: Or atleast makes you seem like you are. Paid characters, like Ginger, for example, WILL punish you if you make a mistake, they are deadly because of the bonus they are given. Maybe in higher levels of gameplay that becomes less noticeable, but in lower levels it's really noticeable, they barely miss. And also there are skill slots unlockable by paying, and that gives more options to people that pay to unlock them, giving them an advantage over free plays. I'll put this on capslock: THE GAME IS NOT FULLY PAY TO WIN. That's not what I'm saying here! What I'm saying is the feeling that I got, that if you're a free player and paying against a paid character in a similar player skill level it's more likeable that he will easily punish your mistakes thanks to the character he has than you are likely to punish is, since you don't have as much stats and special bonus as he has.\n- Matchmaking is... weird: I dont know how matchmaking works on this game, but more than a few times I got to play against players that you could see by the skills they were using that they were atleast 10 levels above the players on my team. And I also felt the reverse on some games, that I was being matched with people levels below. Most of the time it felt fine, but I think it was like 80/20, so I thought it would be worth to mention.\n- Menus: Menus can be a bit confusing for newer players, since they are presented with a huge BOOM of stuff.\n- Clarity: The game isn't very clear on some stuff. For example, I had to go google for quite a bit of time why I couldn't level any stat after putting 5 points into it and the game doesn't tell you what keys to use on your controller, so even if it supports it, it's kind of better to play on the keyboard. That kind of stuff.\n\nOverall it's a good and fun game. I recommend it, even if you don't like basketball that much, give it a shot and try to bring your friends to play it with you, only makes it more fun.

I've played in Thailand servers, in Gamekiss (NA) servers, in 4Game (Russian) servers and my country always had a big community in this game because we are big on basketball. There will be a lot of comparing\n\n[h1]Before my rant, remember: I HATE BASKETBALL.[/h1]\n\nYes, I hate basketball. I've played this game for so long (the Freestyle 1 version) even though I hate basketball. You know why? Because this game is super fun even if you don't know anything about basketball. There is constant action, it's super rewarding to block, rebound and when you hit a 3-pointer, it's the best feeling ever.\n\n[h1]Freestyle 1 was actually rather bad.[/h1]\n\nIt was full P2W, clothes that give attributes were all costing money, the OP moves that were difficult to block were all expensive and you HAD to buy them with real life money. There were serveral exploits like when you receive a pass, you get a speedboost. Exploiting that, you could always step back faster than your opponent and make yourself unblockable. Level system was awful, you only got your real position at level 15 and the grind to 45 (max level) was like the whole game. High level people could do anything and everything so you had to block them every time because they would hit every shot. You know why that was awful? That's right, the speed boost exploit.\n\n[h1]Freestyle 2 possibly improves every mechanic that existsted in FSSB1.[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*] Skills costs like 3k at the start, meanwhile you get like 50k points at the start by registering, eliminating the grinding element of the game.\n[*] Freestyles (Skills that only makes your shot/dunk different, making it harder to be blocked) can now be used only once or twice per game because you have to meet the requirements to do them. However, once you do them, it's garanteed points, so I think that's a nice touch.\n[*] You choose freestyles on your own, instead of them spinning in the exact same order for the whole game.\n[*] Music is constantly playing in game, making you feel in action. Also, the soundtrack makes you super pumped, while you can also configure it\n[*] FSSB1 Games were all the same: PFs/Cs rebound, pass it to SGs and they shoot 3points OR PFs just dunking and you can't block them because they have paid for the awesome almost unblockable dunks. In FSSB2, or at least in early stages of FSSB2, it won't be like this. SGs can be blocked easily, there are way more rebound patterns for rebounders to learn, etc.\n[*] Bigger skill variety\n[*] Can be played with a controller. I haven't tried it yet, but I think it might be really fun\n[*] Awesome rewarding system, making you feel progressing, most daily quests  aren't considered grinding and there are constant events. You also constantly get items and a lot of points, also making the game not P2W\n[/list]\n\n[b] EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE BASKETBALL, YOU WILL ENJOY THIS GAME [/b]\n\nIt's super rewarding. I watched a streamer play it with friends in front of 13k thousand viewers yesterday and he had a blast, meanwhile not even knowing that you can't shoot while you are getting defended by someone. He still had fun, I saw the excitement in his eyes meanwhile he was watching whether  the ball will go into the basket or not. [b] ALSO, IT'S SUPER FUN TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS[/b]\n\n[b]Even if you dislike basketball, dislike sports games like I do, you might still have a blast. It might still be super fun for you, or at least fun for 3-10 hours. You have nothing to lose, it's  free to play. Grab some friends, put your game pants and gunnars and go play it! This game is awesome and the devs definitely stepped up their game, adding new elements and improving  the old ones.[/b]\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1428834580, "timestamp_updated": 1428834580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.74957430362701416", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21432706": {"recommendationid": "21432706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004829118", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460775414}, "language": "english", "review": "My game was stuck on the loading screen on 40%.

I only experience small amounts of latency issues that really changed the tide of the match but it was rare. \n\nMy true gripe with the game is the balancing as you level up, not so much the balance once you're at the top of level and have unlocked all the skills and attributes. During the first few levels on the beginner server, the game is fun but it's ruined by ball hogs and people who don't understand the sport or the game at all. I think out of 50+ Matches I had in the beginner server, very very few of the matches were competitive. Either your team stomped the other team or your team got stomped because you were paired up with people who didnt understand the fundamentals to the game (would try to do half court shots with a C, SG's would just stay under the rim for a rebound) But the games that were closer in score were actually really fun. Once you're fresh out of the beginner server, thats when the game gets even worse, you still have people who don't understand the game at all but not only that, you are matched up against people who have unlocked very strong skills that you don't have access to until you grind out several dozen matches. These skills literally make the player exponentionally overpowered compared to the skills you have when you are a fresh level 12 (Alley-Oop spam, Back Step dribble, etc.) So you have to endure through these matches because more often then not, you will be paired up with people still learning the game and have no idea how to play against teams that are already overpowered so they resort to afk exp farming. That alone is abused like heck, people just matches just to afk and get the match experience because they know they will most likely lose to higher level players. \n\nI'd love to recommend the game because it can be really fun, but it just gets worse until you get to much higher level and everyone balances out and the game becomes more skill based. But enduring the grind of the early levels coupled with players that don't understand the game and the afk farm, just ruins it all for me.", "timestamp_created": 1428969764, "timestamp_updated": 1428969764, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510355889797210693", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24891981": {"recommendationid": "24891981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177475769", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1533477246}, "language": "english", "review": "Do not download this game it has a BitCoin Miner\n\nfucking bastards who made this game \n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1471112739, "timestamp_updated": 1471112739, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520307481288909912", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20596516": {"recommendationid": "20596516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077488157", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 32944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1540304496}, "language": "english", "review": "I have this game now only for 2 days but if youre an BBall Fan you will love it.\n\nI played today 16h i mean wth...\n\nAnime Style and Street basketball.. \nget it !\n\nUpdate :\nStill playing.

IT will suck away your already non-existant life and make you miserable. This game is not for the weak. The skill difference between top players and beginners is like a pro player in League vs a Bronze player. With the ASTOUNDING 50 active playerbase, you will eventually get put up against players that will destroy you sooner than you know(probably 1 week into the game).  Those that cannot survive a TOXIC COMMUNITY WHERE EVERYONE THINKS THEY ARE THE BEST and insanely unbalanced games due to THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS BY MOST PEOPLE SO THEY CAN BE OVERPOWERED should just leave. Backed with the fact that the company running this game wants to take your money, you will be pounded in AND out of game. Sure, the gameplay itself is fun and addictive. But still IT ISN'T WORTH IT. As a player who has achieved the PINNACLE OF FS2(becoming a major tournament champion), I would trade back these 2000 HOURS WASTED for a pack of condoms. Don't do this to yourself.

Stopped playing. \n\nUnfortunately, the issues that are obvious aren't obvious enough, apparently. There is no beginner server, you have to play from level 1-23 (or 24, can't remember), which is a big gap. When you are level one, you have almost no skills, no stat points, and no idea how to play. By the time you reach level ~15, you have a basic understanding of the game. \n\nThen starts the next problem, after 1-23, you have 23-50. \n\nThen you start to regret playing the game. Community is extremely toxic since you play with your level 24 against people who could have hundreds of hours on the game over you. All of the skills unlock at 24 but you need in-game points to buy them, something you need to play a lot to buy. Even if you were to buy them all, you need to level up to get the skill-slots. Most of the time you will get stomped on in whatever role you chose, get made-fun-of by your teammates and called a noob and worthless. You will not learn anything unless you meet the rare 1/50 nice person who will play with you anyway. Most of the time, you go back and make a new character, just to play in the low level server again. \n\nIf you decide to go through the game with friends, it will make the experience slightly better. Only thing is you and your friends have to dedicate to losing a lot. It takes dedication to get better in this game, learning the jank controls and precise timing (especially if you don't have a ping of under 50.) That dedication can certainly be broken by losing to P2W characters non-stop for a whole night.\n\nAlso, the game is P2W. You get more stat points for purchasing special characters and more stats for buying points on your clothes. Pay money, get better/more stat points. Also, the game is dictated by what skills you attach, and you can pay to get more skill slots therefore have an even bigger advantage.\n\nI would avoid this unless you have two friends who enjoy sports games.", "timestamp_created": 1504159667, "timestamp_updated": 1504159667, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649631023406982422", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48257342": {"recommendationid": "48257342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168567609", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 25245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547682133}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b] Illegal Gambling to Win. [/b][/h1]\n\nI will review the gameplay, pay model, and community here, in that order.\n\n[u] Gameplay [/u]\nThe gameplay is fun. You can practice for hours mastering different skills, and skill combinations to compete with other players. Games are pretty quick, and the arcade feel and cartoon graphics will initially draw you in as you realize how much potential this game has. Every other aspect of the game will do the opposite and push you away.\n\n[u] Illegal Gambling to Win [/u]\n[b] This is quite possibly the worst and most predatory business model gaming has ever seen. [/b]\nYou will need to spend $20 - $40 to create a character. A regular character! A special character can cost you $200 - $1000+ as you need to gamble and get lucky. \n\nThen you will need clothes, $5 - $10 for each piece then add another $3 - $10 to add stats.  \n\n$20 for skill slots. You can purchase 2 more skill slots for a monthly fee of $3. And you will need to pay $15 a month for a VIP subscription that adds another skill slot, and if you keep your subscription for a year, you can get another skill slot.\n\nAt this point you are about $100 deep and you now have an $18 monthly subscription!\n\nAnd now we get into cards. If you want to actually be competitive you will need cards that increase your stats even further. Expect to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars gambling for the cards you want. To get the best cards, you will need the full set of 3. Once you have those cards you will also need to re-roll the secondary stat lines, that actually improve your character more than the primary stats. You can spend a few hundred more getting those.\n\nThis will not be the only system you will find yourself gambling in by far. Even things you get with in game currency is attached to a gambling system. Toys that have a small chance to activate every game you will purchase with points in loot box form. The freestyle skills, which give you special animations with a higher chance of succeeding will be granted at random with coupons.\n\nThere are 3 different gambling balls you can purchase to access 3 different item types. \n\nEven the events are gambling. While they may provide some cash shop items during these, sometimes, the majority of them will involve gambling. Right now it is a \"Wheel of Fortune.\" \n\nEven the new enhance system is just another loot box system, that requires you to keep on pumping in cash to access the rewards you got from the loot box. \n\nIt is no mistake that this game is cartoon and anime themed with all of these gambling mechanics. Korean games have a very long history of aggressively pushing gambling to the extreme on games targeting kids and teenagers. \n\n [u] Community [/u]\nIf you are new, you can expect to have a terrible time while trying to learn this game. It doesn't help that at level 24 you are thrusted head first to play in the pro lobby where you will compete with people twice your level who have invested tons of money. \n\nYou will find that some players will automatically kick you from their lobbies, and when there are only 8 lobbies, you may have a hard time even playing a match. \n\nOr you will find that there are a lot of individuals who get mad if anybody except for them touches the ball. They will throw full blown tantrums. \n\nOnce you do get the hang of things, you will still run into completely toxic individuals.\n\n\n\n[u] A few other problems to note [/u]\n[list]\n[*] Servers are based in california so no matter how good you are, you can not compete with 10-20 ping individuals\n[*] Game crashes frequently\n[*] Racial slurs as usernames \n[*] Very little information on game features\n[*] Skills not working properly\n[*] Very few people playing (2-24 people in total in pro lobby)\n[/list]\n\nStay away from JoyCity Corp.", "timestamp_created": 1547230755, "timestamp_updated": 1547230755, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665882349014282227", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30051400": {"recommendationid": "30051400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144783197", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 12509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488602634}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game. 10/10\nPlayers 3/10\n\nThe people in it?

Secondly, if you are still considering playing the game then good, you don't actually need to do any in game purchase, the only thing you need to play the game is patience and practise. As a die-heart player since the release and the termination of FS1, I indeed enjoy this game a lot. Though sometimes bug does annoys me, but the overall gaming experience is quite entertaining. With few basketball related games on the market, this game is a really nice choice.\nMore detail version of the game review starts from here:\nPros:\n1. Nice user interface design.\n2. Easy to understand what is going on while playing. (Of course you need to at least know how to play basketball in real life)\n3. Great sense of rewarding.\n4. Really need to grind to master the skills and the different play styles with different positions as teammates.\n5. P2W rarely exist in the early stage of playing this game.\n6. Very nice character customise system.\n7. Good music.\n\nCons:\n1. Very unfriendly towards newbies. (Potential name calling all game long)\n2. P2W becomes more and more obvious because of the latest updates.\n3. Players with money can outplay you every single time even you have tried your best since they have better cards. (This happens even when you hit lvl50, and the good cards are just too OP.)\n4. Need a lot of patience and luck if you are a \"I won't pay sht for gaming\" player, this especially applies to the card drawing. (I mean, to get legend cards that suit your positions is just almost so depressing at times. I waited until lvl43 to finally get some good cards with pure luck.)\n5. P2W when you hit lvl40.\n6. SW side step is just OP.\n7. I don't even want to mention SG after updates.\n8. PF who knows how to dunk makes you look silly because you can only guess the block if you don't have OP block attribute.\n9.ISO games are really boring. If you are C/PF/CT, go get rebs, other people stand and watch.\n10.

Despite the community is a little bit bad, but, just stay strong and ignore them, like you're deaf or something. It's not a big deal, but the big deal is dealing with yourself. It's F**KING HARD to ignore them, and I've played this game for 700+ hours, you know how much pain I've gone through. But it's really fun, trust me.

The leveling system feels fleshed out and rewarding.\n3) It's a visually beautiful game. The cel shading, while causing depth issues with my bad eyes, is a really nice theme and makes me feel like i'm in a basketball manga.  \n4) All the positions feel unique\n5) Very skill based.\n6) You can mute chat \n\nCons\n1) Major issues with matchmaking and queue time. The suggested queue is 2:30 but outside of peak hours in pro channel sometimes it'll take up to 10 minutes to find a match. \n\n2) Ded game xd. Small would definetely describe the community. Not only massive queue times, but expect to replay teams. I've played the same team four times in a row before. That also applies to joining teams. This game is like a shitty highschool where everyone knows eachother. If you play about 50 matches in a week it feels like you've pretty much versed the entire active playerbase. Before you know it you'll be instakicked from a random lobby you matchmaked to enter cause the host thought you were ass on Tuesday. \n\n3) The game doesn't teach you how to play defense. The game tells you to stay in front of your opponent and that's it.  Most new players will be left on an island trying to figure out how to block long directional layups and directional dunk or correctly face up. The most effective guide to defending is on YouTube because this game gives you no good advice in it's practice mode.  \n\n4) Clunky Controls. I have almost 200+ hours in the game and movement is still awkward, clunky, and boxy on every character I play. Say, you're chasing down a shooter running to the corner, and you're inbetween the corner and the wing, your first instinct is to run in a straight line at the shooter. You'll be going in the direction of the shooter but if you're using arrow keys there's no guarantee you're running at the shooter in a straight line which means you might have to slightly shift directions with your keys and lose speed. \n\n5) Crashes. This games crashes like a drunk cousin on your couch. Some days my game will crash up to 5 times in a row at tip off. This also happens with other players all the time sending you continously back to matchmaking.\n\n6) Very very very P2W elements in the game. GK tries to give out free stuff during it's events to distract you from that. You can grind missions all day for like 3 card balls or spend $10 right now and get 14. Or log on all week for a single prism card when they're on sale right now for 10 for $5. Most people wonder how the game is P2W if it's skill based but, stats and good cards matter and make a difference. \n\nFinal thoughts: \nFS2 is a brilliant concept with fun gameplay but poor execution in general. I'd only recommend the game in a few scenarios: \n-With a group of friends you'd have fun with win or lose. \n-If you're a basketball fan who can't afford 2k. \n\nBut for the most part just taking the game seriously or a ladder daddy as a free to play isn't really fun at this point.", "timestamp_created": 1537720475, "timestamp_updated": 1537720475, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593195259571075439", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15274409": {"recommendationid": "15274409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073820151", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462022431}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, cool game and when u look at it u think oh it is a shit game but infact it is so enjoyable I love it to bits and the crew system they have in the game is amazing I do recommend this game to kids above 10+ years of age.", "timestamp_created": 1428561559, "timestamp_updated": 1428561559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594952046871185303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25028098": {"recommendationid": "25028098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116714353", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1544252219}, "language": "english", "review": "This game in short is a great experience by yourself until a point.

It starts of slow because rookie channel is very basic and you are in rookie channel for a good amount of time (for like the first 24 lvls or so, in my opinion way too long) but once in pro channel is when the fun starts. You can get a group of 3 friends in a private room or just play with randoms to get a game going.  \n\nNow there are many cons to this game as well. The game is definitely dying because the devs are not doing anything to really help this game or the players. As a result, there are not many new players making rookie channel seem very dead and can often be hard to get into a game. Pro channel is a lot better but not like how it was 2 years ago. Next, this game is p2w. There's no doubt that spending some cash will get you an advantage over others. Characters don't matter, it's really the card system in the game that can really boost your stats. There are also good amount of hackers in this game now due to the lack of management. Lastly this game is heavily reliant on ping. If your ping is anything over 60ish, playing big man will be difficult. You can get away with it in rookie but pro channel won't be as forgiving, this is coming from a player whose main position is PF with a ping of 80.\n\nIn summary, I really do like this game... a lot...but at it's current state it's no wonder that it is dying off. Maybe a miracle will happen and devs will actually get their sh*t together but that is very unlikely.

Since I was 12 years old, Freestyle has been my favorite game.\nIt has been with me throughout all my teenage years, and I don't regret a thing.\n\nEver since it first came out in 2006 (published by Activision), the game has had issues maintaining a good population due to lack of advertising and support from the foreign developers (JCE).\n\nThat's all hopefully going to change now that it has been released on Steam. It's a shame how we had to wait so many years for this because this is one of the most competitive games in the world.\n\nEverybody who plays this game strives to ultimately be the best, and it's a team game so you have to find 2 other players who share the same mindset as you and want to be the best just as bad as you are.\n\nA lot of this game consists of managing egos of not only your rivals, but your teammates also.\nThere is only one ball in the game of basketball, and scoring is only one part of it.\nYou have to have a good overall team that can not only score, but rebound, defend, block, steal, and pass at the right times.\n\nThis game is all about customization and making your player unique. There is a big item shop in the game that allows you to buy headgear,tops,bottoms, shoes, and accesories to make your baller look unique.\n\nThere are also Freestyles that allow you to change basic animations like dunks and shots so you can turn your simple one handed dunk in to a crazy 360 between the legs dunk!\n\nThen you have your skills. Skills are new animations and upgrades you unlock through leveling your character.\nSkills are the most important part of the game since they give really useful animations like diving for the ball or fading away.\n\nWhen you first start the game and you go in to Rookies, you will be playing versus new players such as yourself who are also learning the game and it will be a cake walk for those who learn faster than others.\n\nBeware though, there is a huge learning curve when you reach the big leagues (PRO Channel).\nPeople do NOT like losing in Pros because it will result in their win % going down and the person that beat you having proof of them beating you.\n\nI was never a guy to make many friends on this game, in fact I made a lot more enemies than I did friends and I am very hated but my advice to you new players is, make some friends before you reach Pros.\n\nTry your hardest to communicate and socialize, post on the forums. MAKE FRIENDS. You do not want to be that \"random\" \"unknown\" person in Pros because nobody knows you and you will be kicked out of teams that have good players when you try to join because they simply don't know you.\n\nYou will be stuck on the \"Noob Treadmill\". That means you will be stuck playing only with players who are really bad and don't care who they play with, and other unknown players like you are which means you will lose A LOT and people will never see you as good.\n\nSo make friends before you get to pros! Get your name out there.\nIf you pick up this game and decide you like it and you're either a PG,PF,or C then you can add my character in game, I will help you. My IGN is: Zarry\n\nSo yeah, that is it for my long review and although my time on this game is coming to an end, I am happy it is finally getting the exposure it deserves because I know theres a kid out there right now maybe even reading this whos 12 or 13 years old that will fall in love with this game and aspire to be the very best player just like I did.\n\nGood look in the pros, newbs.", "timestamp_created": 1427922326, "timestamp_updated": 1427922326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 132, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.711421668529510498", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 8, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 3157, "total_negative": 1322, "total_reviews": 4479}}
