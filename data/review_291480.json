Arsenal is an in-game progression system. You earn points much like experience, which is put towards a gear category of your choosing.\n\n2. Kredit guns are found in Random Kredit Boxes, and can also be fairly tough to get.\n\nBoth these branches are fairly balanced against one another, and as any other game with a progression system, Warface requires effort to unlock advanced gear.\n\nHope that clarified the system, but I'll be sure to forward your feedback to the devs. Game is updated monthly and if something is out of place, we'll be sure to step in and correct that."}, "49264931": {"recommendationid": "49264931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198241485326", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1016, "last_played": 1551738306}, "language": "english", "review": "good enough.\nruns alright on my shitty laptop.", "timestamp_created": 1551284471, "timestamp_updated": 1551284471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53608250617980957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49295809": {"recommendationid": "49295809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203178886", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550347945}, "language": "english", "review": "Broken economy.

Miami i get 2 bars.\n   B*  Its riddled with South and North Korean players. Nothing against them as people but when i unload a mag on them and watch their player character flinch with no damage marker on my screen and then i am the one killed on a server that is 30ms ping and i die im pissed.\n  C* half the time after i reload i cant aim down my sights or shoot, yet when i play this game on PS4 i do not have the same problem.... HMMM interesting since the first day i got it on PS4 i was instantly on the VIP cause i got it at the right time.  ( PAY TO WIN? YOU BE THE JUDGE..... ) and on PS4 ive played on both the Dallas and Miami servers.\n\n2.) it has fun mechanics riddled with bugs,  all the abilities each class are cool but.......(go back to server issues for why) \n  A* the slide mechanic is nice (doest happen on my PS4 VIP Dallas or Miami server). but it only works half the time. may be server related im not sure ive only had it work for me once.  that being said the closest Server i have to me is Dallas. PS4 is  different story they have a Miami  server or at least the last time i check they did\n\n3.) i honestly dont even feel like explaining anymore. this game isnt great it isnt good it probably was at first but from what ive read of other reviews and from what i have played i see why ppl dont like it.

My one and only complain worth while is connectivity issues.  From time to time, I get disconnected and stuck during game.  This doesn't happen all the time but it does happen and it only happens in Warface that I have noticed. I haven't experienced this with other games. Also, it would be nice to have all updates go through the Steam que like most other games.  The separate My.com client is a bit inconvenient when you have other games that need updating at the same time.  It's not a big deal but would be nice.  All in all,  Warface is amazing and absolutely worth downloading if you are into FPS games at all.  CSGO is the only other FPS I play consistently because it's so bad. Meaning, the aiming is difficult unlike any game I have ever played. It's challenging and I'm terrible at it as well. lol.  But I keep gong back. Ugh.  Warface community is far better than CSGO.  That alone keeps me coming back to Warface.  CSGO community is toxic and full of the most moronic, self entitled, inbred, American trash.  And I'm 100% American btw. lol . WARFACE FTW!!

I thoroughly enjoy almost every class with the sole exception of the Medic class since I find being stuck with a shotgun a bit... Annoying in most Co-op missions and spec ops at hard and higher, sure we can use a really good secondary but EVERY class can when you give a little more thought about it and with that I'd like to suggest adding slugs since those bad boys can make the Medic viable in ranged co-op missions and spec ops, sure it'd make them almost into a sniper class in terms of damage (if that route was taken) but still I find it kind of needed to make Medic a bit more relevant since all I see are people picking mostly assault and hardly EVER see a medic class until the first fail in a Spec Ops (yes I don't use it either because I hate shotguns in this game at least).\n\n\n| The Actual Review | \\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\n\nANYWAYS I'll get back to how I feel about the overall Pve element of the game, It feels really polished in terms of gunplay and system optimization. The LIVE customization for weapons in the middle of weapons is really nice and really sets it far apart from most other shooters which I thoroughly enjoy changing from a 2x to a 1x depending on where I'm at in a mission. The graphics look great for being a F2P while also having really well done optimization so you can run steadily at 60+ fps on high with a lowend gaming rig. If I could think of any cons it's that the American Servers are combined with the Mexico server so you get about 40%-60% of the time people who speak Spanish whilst in a Spec-ops mission making it harder to give callouts for enemy positions which I really can't complain too much about since I rarely talk as is to randoms (do have my callout moments though).\n\n\n| How I feel about the P2w stuff people are going on about this game | \\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\n\nMy thoughts on people who claim this game is P2w, yes it is and no it's not at the same time, most things can be earned legitimately throughout grinding the game which in turn is a long and hasty process but mind you this is a FREE TO PLAY, if you want a game that has \"unfair\" p2w pvp look at Counter Strike Nexon Zombies then tell me that this one is with just 10 items locked behind a lootbox which mind you that the non-special variants are FREE TO GET.\n\nIn Summary I highly recommend this game if you have friends to play with or you're just looking for an amazing PvE Shooter on Steam if you have a lowend compute-- Hell even if you have a highend gaming computer this game is still an absolute blast to play with buddies.\n\n*Edit* Specs & Graphical Settings\nGtx 1060 3gb\n16 Gb of Corsair Vengeance Ram (DDR3)\nFx 8300 overclocked to 4.1 Ghz\n2 Tb Firecuda Hybrid SSD/HDD\n\nI run the game at high 1080p locked at 60fps", "timestamp_created": 1550420370, "timestamp_updated": 1550421049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49110357": {"recommendationid": "49110357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257897978", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550619561}, "language": "english", "review": "Do not download it unless you want brain cancer\n", "timestamp_created": 1550620401, "timestamp_updated": 1550620401, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506578981876373291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49362488": {"recommendationid": "49362488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130078048", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412052610}, "language": "english", "review": "Dead game, Red pinger's, teleports.

The gameplay is amazing, the indicators are pretty good and the missions are mostly enjoyable and satisfying when you complete them. All of the pros that I just mentioned are controlled by Crytek, and my.com has nothing to do with these... Luckily...\n\nSo, what's wrong with my.com you might ask? Almost everything non-gameplay related.\nI am gonna start with free stuff first and then progress to most issues that people have with donator and \"P2W\".\n\nThe vendor system is very grindy. To truly be able to get a gun that is able to rival every box gun currently in PvP, the player MUST buy at least a mega-vip booster in order not to die from boredom sitting and completing the PvE missions and PvP for around 100 or even 200 hours.\nAnd that is if you get lucky with that gun, there might be a case in which you will never get it untill you got all other guns, and in that case the VP cost will be pretty high.\n\nThe warbucks boxes apart from containing the worst chances possible of getting a gun, are mostly bad in general. Lets take the nerfed TWM/AWM for example. In the past it required one shot to kill a player, now it requires 2. That is a big disadvantage because everyone who bought kredits have their bolt-action snipers like AX308 which can oneshot anyone. All of the bad guns are mostly put in the warbucks containers because no one ever uses them nowadays.\n\nI understand that there are better guns which can rival the \"P2W\", however, the chances of getting it temporarily for a good time are insanely low comparing to a kredit container (not talking about permanent), and they are somewhat handicapped comparing to, once again, the guns from the kredit boxes.\n\nThe warlord armor (and the high cost of repair system in general) takes most of the fun away from the game. I am a PvE player myself, who plays without a predetermined team. I fail hard missions around 5 times per mission because my team either couldn't work out a strategy or died early on, leaving me soloing a hard mission. By failing one of these I would get around 50 warbucks as a reward (with 75% VIP booster from daily rewards). The warlord armor (not the complete set) costed 100 warbucks to repair, and my gun costed 30 warbucks to maintain as well. I loose around 70 warbucks per failed mission, which means a lot because the profit margin for these with first daily win reward is around 300 (not talking about doing these twice).\n\nThe special missions are a nightmare compared to the hard missions (on easy when playing public) because it takes around 30 attempts to complete the mission, once again, ON EASY, while playing with a random team. I wouldn't mind attempting these over and over again if not for the insane repair cost and how much I loose by doing these.\n\nNow we shift towards the DLCs from steam and stuff bought with kredits.\n\nThe tournament packs (the DLCs which offered armor by supporting the developers) didn't have a repair cost. When my.com took control, they not only enabled repair costs for these, but also set them to the repair cost of the warlord armor (basically made it pointless to buy a tournament pack). \n\nBefore my.com took over the publishing, the cost on gold weapon repairs was free as a reward to those lucky enough to roll them. Now, there is a repair cost, making it pointless in rolling a golden gun apart from diminishing number buffs which are not noticeable at all and some extra cyborg damage in PvE.\n\n(As for the 2 points I just mentioned, I actually do not know how my.com thinks this will improve their profit margins. It seems like it will, rather, decrease them by a huge amount. Lets move on down the list because there are still more things to discuss.)\n\nMy.com silently nerfs weapons over time and then release newer donator weapons which are more op than before, forcing players to roll them from, you guessed it, the random boxes. Those weapons that were actually good before are now pretty bad... You get the point.\nThere are many more things to cover but I feel like I am just wasting my time making this review. I've read many responses from the developers and they actually haven't adressed any issues pointed out in other reviews. I can guarantee you that if they reply it will be their poor attempt at defending themselves in order to get new players play the game and donate money...\n\nP.S. I didn't mention easy and normal PvE missions as for these I do not use a warlord armor, however, if I did, the repair cost and loss margins would be pretty high.\n\nEDIT 2: So I was playing some casual warface (I only complete easy missions now since there is no point in doing anything else) and a player from south america commented upon seeing someone's golden gun \"It's a shame people actually donate money to this game\"\n\nThis is pretty much the whole community in a nutshell. I have talked to both players who are dedicated to the game (from russian servers where this game originated and people who donated money to the game and actively support the developers with microtransactions) to new players and what they think about the game aspects. New players commented about, of course, the P2W aspect of the game, the microtransactions and everything, and veterans and active donators complain about the server issues, terrible lag even with a pretty good internet connection, and that \"It's almost impossible to kill someone on PvP efficiently if you don't have all 5 ping colums\" quoting one of them.\n\nHowever, NONE of them pointed out the amazing features of the game, the whole gameplay, the indicators, the UI, NONE of them said that this game was a good game and they are amazed by it. That's how bad my.com screwed everyone over. \n\nEven though I am still playing this game (just for the gameplay of course) I wouldn't recommend it to never players. If you still want to try this game out after all of this please, make sure not to donate anything to my.com... 6 years of screwing everyone over at the russian server, and 1 more year to the western side. I am fed up with all of the intolerance of the publishers to the players, and I think everyone should be aware of how badly they handled pretty much everything the game has to offer.\n\nEDIT 3: (After KIWI operation has been completed and multiple actions to get the online up have been done)\n\nTL DR, I can't recommend the game still. And I am mostly sure that I will never be able to, for a simple fact that mail.ru have a bad history of investing into the worst games up to date. For no TL DR continue reading.\n\nKIWI on launch was the worst paid operation in the history of warface. First of all, they launched it on SUMMER!! That's right, when everyone is on a vacation, when everyone wants to enjoy the overseas. Secondly, the rewards were grindy and non-profitable. Last but not least, from my perspective, KIWI trade hub is only open to those who bought the expansion in NA, but available to BUY for everyone in the russian servers (correct me if I am wrong).\n\nThey made an auction called the \"Summer Marathon\" which involved killing 100 players in multiplayer, every day, for at least 45 days of 60 days that the marathon has been going for. The rewards were kinda bad, except for Krazy Horse for the sniper, which is basically a oneshot semi-sniper (its not the meta, even with the max damage it still has x0.8 multiplier on hits, while box guns have x1.0 multiplier on each hit). It's really grindy for NA, but on RU, where everything is controlled by mail.ru (my.com) they actually somehow enjoy it, which I find very confusing.\n\nThey rebalanced AWM,giving it max damage(still has x0.8 multiplier which is the SAME as the semi-sniper called Krazy Horse mentioned above (also full damage only applies to golden version of the gun))You release Krazy Horse for free with better rate of fire and then you give AWM same stats?No space in review left.", "timestamp_created": 1525513841, "timestamp_updated": 1534543853, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 279, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.946142435073852539", "comment_count": 26, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 0, "developer_response": "Hello,molchu.

(unless ofcourse you pay)\nDo you enjoy playing versus hackers?\nDo you enjoy getting votekicked by regular players because you do not have the best score or for no apperent reason?\n\nIf you can answer all these questions with a yes then Warface is the game for you!\n\nThe game starts out pretty nice. There are special rooms for new members where everybody uses almost the same (underpowered) weapons and armor. For the first 30 or 40 matches your chances are fair and you might even start to like the game. When you get to lvl 13 you are placed in the rooms with the members that pay for the game and get all the overpowerd gear. From this moment on your chances will strongly decline unless you are willing to pay.\n\nI started playing back in 2015 when the game was under Crytek. The game was pretty nice back then. Updates were plenty, hackers got banned quickly and you could play the game without spending a single euro or dollar. Paying members got their stuff a bit faster, could get some nice skins and some other perks but everybody had the same chance during the game. \n\nSinces the start of 2017 My.com took over and the game changed for the worse. (As you can see from all the negative reviews that came pouring in) First I waited patiently because a migration from one developer to another can take some time. After about 3 months into 2017 the game is becoming almost impossible to play. Warface is changing from a free to play game with chances for everybody to a free to play game with chances for those who are willing to invest fast amounts of money (id say \u20ac60 and more if you want to be able to play every class with decent weapons). Upkeep of your weapons and armor is now exceding the amount you earn from missions. Paying members are able to use these armors and weapons while the free to play members are left with and unfair disadvantege.\n\nUntill now hackers are free to use whatever hack they want. During 'ranked' matches normal players are getting carried by hackers and My.com doesnt do anything about it. If for some reason you take the time to report this to My.com they send you an automated messages trough their support system that makes it seem like they are taking your problem serious while in fact the same(!) hackers are continue playing. If you send another message to support (about the same or a different subject) they send you the exact copy paste message back. \n\nTo make it all worse, there is apparently a bug or hack that grants you certain ablities (kicking, banning) to use against regular members (although i have only seen this during the ranked matches). I have reported this over a month ago to My.com and the same member is still abusing this bug today. In the more then 2000 hours I got on recored playing this game I have seen a strong decline during the last months. If you are in doubt of playing this game or if you should or should not spend money on it I would strongly discourage it.\n\nMy advice would be to not start playing warface or at the very least not spend a single euro on it.\n\nUpdate 21-08-2018:\nThere are still hackers in the game, a problem My.com fails to solve for over more then a year now.\n\nUpdate 22-08-2018:\nYet another couple of hackers in ranked.", "timestamp_created": 1491908471, "timestamp_updated": 1534958941, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 215, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.904743671417236328", "comment_count": 22, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35938540": {"recommendationid": "35938540", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970237221", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 199897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1544502892}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played this game for 3000+ hours, loved it.

Okay whatever, I was on a break anyways. Fast forward 10months to today. Lag, empty servers, nearly everything in the store requires ingame currency called Kredits that are exclusively from microtransactions. Don't get me wrong, theyve always been there. Just lesss pronounced and definitely not the primary way for you to get anything. \n\nI can look past a lot of BS, but this is like an old friend who has been replaced with someone else. I don't know them anymore. I am scared that I will never laugh as hard as I did playing this game during the themed holiday events again. Santa/Reindeer themed armor, candy cane knifes, santa boots, buralp sack helmets with spooky faces, OP squirt guns, toy shovels, etc. \n\nThis developers maknig a lot of changes, and I feel like a lot of them are terrible. Mainly, the excellent pefromance of the servers allowing for split second twitch gaming decisions that are REQUIRED to complete many of the ingame bonuses. This a warning old friend.

Bad connection, random DCs from the server\n\n2. P2W\n\n3. Toxic community\n\n\n[b] 1. Bad connection, random DCs from the server:[/b]\n\nThe connection is just really bad even if im close to the server. The ping bar just goes to 1-4 (1 lowest, 5 highest, I can't even reach 5 tho im close to the server) randomly. Every 20 minutes or so I keep getting the message Lost connection to server. The game gives you EXP, Warface $ and vendor points only if you finish a match, but with disconnecting you won't get anything. That being said I can not progress in game or if I can the only way is thru PvP since they are short in time but I can't play any Co-op or Spec ops because it takes around 30-50 minutes and I would just disconnect, waste my 40 mins and get nothing. Completely ruins the game.\n\n[b] 2. P2W [/b]\n\nThere are a lot of guns, gears in this game that is true, but the thing is all the guns that you can get for free is almost completely garbage compared to the guns that you can unbox for REAL LIFE MONEY. Before you try to buy any random boxes in this game, let me warn you. The chances of getting a permanent normal gun from a box is 1%, to get a gold gun its around 0.1%. These percentages might seem okay but keep in mind you are actually paying real money for them and the boxes are random and aren't cheap (5 box is around 2.8 euro). Its basically gambling to get guns that are better than free guns that you just unlock by playing.\n\nThe game got a repair system. Example if you have a gun thats durability is at 90% you will need to pay 400 Warface dollars to repair it to 100% which is okay. Since My.com came here they decreased the money rewards from matches and increased the repair costs, its legit impossible to maintain your weapons if you don't have VIP (which is again can be obtained by paying real money or by getting it from an event but that is extremely rare and its for few days not like months).\n\n[b] 3. Toxic community [/b]\n\nIn EVERY single match there is a guy calling someone a hacker or ping abuser/lagger. Players tend to kick the other player who isn't that good in the game and with that he won't get any match rewards because he was kicked.\nIt is just generally annoying that like 70% of the community calls someone a hacker or they just go nuts and spam the chat EVEN players with almost 1000 hours, its just sad (I thought those players were smarter and actually won't cry about everything). Because of this the mood in the game is bad.\n\nBefore I wrote this I checked the My.com support but that did not help, they are bots. . .\nThe game is about money now. Yes I do know its a Free to play game and they need the money but this is just too much man, they even removed the auction house that was a place where you could get permanent guns even for free if your lucky enough.\n\nP.S.: Hitreg is garbage too", "timestamp_created": 1505586633, "timestamp_updated": 1505586757, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 85, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.853841304779052734", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 0, "developer_response": "Hello.\n\nSorry about your experiences in the game, let me go over each point one by one.\n\n1.

Having played FPS games and observed them since 2002, I have a good understanding of responsiveness, smooth combat, progression, and balance for weapons. Now onto the show.\n\nFirst off, there is a massive problem with the progression system. Its pacing is off putting for players. Nobody is going to want to play 15+ missions with ~15-30 mins playtime each to progress a few pieces of gear that are only useful for slight improvments to your weapons (Supressor, LMG weapons, Same class gear for 4 missions). All of that time doesnt make up for what you spent in time.\n\nStarter weapons are really bad, but understandable. New players get a base weapon kit to work with, breaking out of the same weapon threshold take ~10 hours for a gun that is an \"improvement\". Father in their progression does provide access to more weapons, its those weapons however that make a difference in harder missions.\n\n//Speaking of weapons, progression SHOULD NOT include better stats weapons, only access to weapons that provide more flexibilty in certain combat situations.// (Developer Recommendation)\n\nAnimations. Are. PERFECT. Reload animations and such is the bread and butter for a good FPS game. With that, its sliding anims, and crouch animations in third person are a little clunky. First person has great animations however.\n\nMovement... its not good. Its always delayed and you feel as if you are going slow for a sprint. Movement input should be direct and not tied with animations, but to shadow the input. Vaulting feels weird and not smooth.\n\nPvE is broken, to an extent. Normal and easy are what you would expect, however hard makes it similar to special operations in difficulty on normal. Its not good, NPCs can one shot if they have a shotgun. Scripted events in the game, like the helicopter extraction or mission objectives are buggy and dont trigger when you complete them. Its a recent problem however that I've seen.\n\nP2W is also broken, but expected. Marketting throws in your face as you join the game to a gargon of info about store related ads or the progression keeps reminding you that your playing a F2P game and paying is somehow that way to getting out of a rut. I personally never purchased something purely to observe that progression as far as possible to get enough info to write this review. Again, weapons that are bought have a HUGE buff to stats and effects. PvP I havent tried much of, however from what I did play its a toxic, broken mess of a system. P2W is real in PvP, its real in PvE, and its downright horrible for F2P who dont want to spent money on a game.\n\nGraphics, system options, and neverending content is good. Warface i think always tried to provide the \"new\" to warface, even though you had problems with base game mechanics. Great job to them for that. However a section of their development team needs dedication to bugs and balance to the game in general. (Quoting previously said remarks above)\n\nAll in all the game is good, but not good enough to match standards of \"Good\" FPS games. Its fair in terms of a rating. If you join this community expect toxic behavior with people, P2W aspects invading everything you do (PvP and PvE), and hard putty paywalls and \"snail\" progression.\n\nIm Sorry Warface.

Arsenal is an in-game progression system. You earn points much like experience, which is put towards a gear category of your choosing.\n\n2. Kredit guns are found in Random Kredit Boxes, and can also be fairly tough to get.\n\nBoth these branches are fairly balanced against one another, and as any other game with a progression system, Warface requires effort to unlock advanced gear.\n\nHope that clarified the system, but I'll be sure to forward your feedback to the devs. Game is updated monthly and if something is out of place, we'll be sure to step in and correct that."}, "41918387": {"recommendationid": "41918387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088055421", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 50895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 29, "last_played": 1551044006}, "language": "english", "review": "The game Warface is slowly becoming impossible to be played. I can remember the times when the game could be played several hours a day. At those times the game was owned by a different company which took care of it. Nowadays, the game is administered by a different company and playing it is very bad. It is obvious that the owners of the game take care only of money from the game and not of people who play it. What is the problem? The thing is that most people who play the game cheat and this makes playing the game difficult for players who do not cheat. Cheat is used by so many people that it makes it impossible to play a normal game. The Golden Age of the game is over. It used to take some seconds to connect to the game. Nowadays, however, it takes several minutes. Why? Because people do not want to play against cheats. Neither do I. That is why I have decided to undertake the process of sending this message to everyone who has mentioned the word Warface. Moreover, I will also add some links for cheat in the game to the message. Why have I decided this way? Because the more cheats in the game, the less profit for the company that provides K oder Randombox. The company should take it into consideration and act in favour of fair players!!! The message for them: Do not invest into new weapons or maps since nobody would invest into them because of cheat players.\nSo make an effort to stop cheating players! No chance for cheats! Enable making a detecting server for Warface and choose an administrator to check the fairness as it was the case of Far Cry 1. Pay the administrator for every unfair player who was marked and announced. Those steps would make the fair players happy.

It is not worth your time, effort and especially your money. [/h1]\n\nUpdate; WARNING: Thanks to Daedalus007 for pointing it out for me.\nThe game launcher, [b] my.com game center [/b] has been reported as a malware by many sources. One such source is: https://www.virusresearch.org/remove-my-com-game-center-malware/ . I am no malware and antivirus expert in any way, therefore I can't confirm the allegations. Yet, I still believe that it should be addressed here for people to be aware of the possibility of malicious programs. Will remove if there's evidence proving the contrary. Until then, just be cautious of what you are installing on your PC.\n\nTL;DR: Not worth your time. Decent game converted into a P2W model that is exarcebated by slow, crippling progression; high repair fees, random boxes w/real money, and power creep; which plainly conveys the cash grab nature of my.com. Along with server issues, bad netcode, toxic community and a lack of strong anticheat, it is a miracle that this cash cow is still up and running.\n\nWarface starts out as your generic first person shooter, akin to the Call of Duty formula, where you play as a soldier of Warface, a peacekeeping organization that defend the world from Blackwood, which is your typical bad organization that exploits the population in the favelas, indulges in unethical experimentation and forges massive plans in order to gain world dominance. You and 4 other players form a squad to undertake dangerous missions, be it in tight urban streets or complex buildings with high tech equipment. Every mission have you go from checkpoint to checkpoint, dealing with massive amounts of Blackwood soldiers and ultimately fighting a boss; which in most cases is just a a giant bipedal mech or an helicopter.\n\nThere are four classes that you can pick from. These include:\n[list]\n  [*]Rifleman: uses rifles and provides ammunition.\n  [*]Medic: uses shotguns, heals and revive teammates.\n  [*]Engineers: uses SMGs, patch you up with kevlar and has the highest operational speed for technical actions such as planting and defusing bombs.\n  [*]Snipers: uses sniper rifles to kill from afar.\n[/list]\n\nThe progression system is tied to XP for ranks and VP (vendor points) to unlock free weapons, armor and attachments. You can also rent/buy other weapons and armor that are exclusive to the shop, either with warface dollars (ingame currency) or kredit (real life currency). Armor and weapons must be repaired, except for the default equipment.\n\nPVP is also present, as it should be.  There's a diverse amount of PVP modes, including classic team deathmatch, free for all, plant the bomb and many other modes; even the trendy battle royale mode.\n\nSounds good so far. The COD formula is generally bland, but pretty effective for a fast, arcade-y game that people can casually enjoy and engage. If co-op is your cup of tea, maybe you can give it a try. Sometimes it can be fun and engaging playing with friends and screwing up every once in a while. But that's it.\n\nSo here, let me ask you a question; Why do you play games? Is it for the challenge? For the story? Gameplay? That's up to you to decide and I can't tell you what you must and must not do. However, almost everyone play for something in common: to be rewarded and this game is definitely not rewarding at all.\n\n{Kind of contradictory from someone that has more than 700 hours invested in the game. Yes, I know. But I do have my reasons, and one of them is being that I have friends that play this game. I casually dip in and play sessions with them as it is quite entertaining, which echoes what I stated before (...can casually enjoy and engage...). Silly quirks like killing your friends with a defribilator is what gives it a somewhat small unique experience not found elsewhere.}\n\nEvery game session, either PVE or PVP, grants you little amount of warface dollars that is further diminished by the fact of having your equipment's repair costs very high. You are often left with a measly amount of cash or with a net loss in general. Kind of off putting as it is more punishing than rewarding.\n\nThe shop is just riddled with kredit random boxes (or more commonly referred to \"lootboxes\"). If this fact already swayed you away from even playing the game; congratulations, you are far more intelligent than me. To be fair, it also have a catalogue of weapons that you can [b]rent[/b] (not buy) with warface dollars. And there's a few random boxes which can be bought with warface dollars. However powercreep and stealth nerfs are a thing in this game. In many instances, your current weapon will be outclassed by a new shiny weapon that can only be won from new kredit random boxes (or recently through direct sale, but realistically, with that amount of money you can buy a couple of AAA titles in steam when steam sales are on). There's a slight, but noticeable pressure pushed unto the player to buy their stuff with your hard earned cash.\n\nOn to the next problem: Servers. \nMore often than not, you will encounter many players with red ping. Maybe the word \"many\" is an understatement. Let me use another word, more befitting of the situation: [b]most[/b] of the players have red ping. If you live near the servers, you'll be in for a good time. But far from the servers, outside of NA? Red ping for you I guess. The difference in ping and latency is quite noticeable in this game, unlike other games which uses a better netcode. Players with a good ping often have the upper hand as they are able to see before a player that has a red ping.  Sometimes this looks like wallhacks to the red pinger.\n\nAnd on the subject of wallhacks, the anti-cheat employed in Warface is weak, very weak. There are cheats created regularly for this specific game. And even if cheaters are caught, they just create another account because that's one of the downside of a free to play model. And from the paragraph before, it is quite difficult to discern whether it was cheats or just a serious issue of bad netcode.\n\nWhich leads to a toxic community, full of themselves and calling other people names or allegating people that they hack in order to feel better. If you hated the COD community, this is certainly not going to be what you are looking for. The convoluted mess of their servers and bad netcode, anti-cheats, cheaters, and flamers is what and will deter legit players from even playing the damn game.\n\nI don't like to tell people what to do and not to do. But for this specific instance, you must not play this game. Look elsewhere. I am sure there are better games out there.\n\nI rate this game 5/7 (really, I wouldn't even rate this game seriously. It sucks and that's the short version of it).\n\nEDIT:Many spellchecks and corrections.", "timestamp_created": 1537580104, "timestamp_updated": 1539056567, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 138, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.862483441829681396", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 0, "developer_response": "Hi there! To start with, thank you for putting that much effort into writing the review. You seem to describe the gameplay pretty well in the first several paragraphs so I'll skip on to the points you've raised and would probably want to see addressed. :) Oh and before we get there, I wouldn't dismiss your point just because you've got over 700h, after all, writing this review helps the community choose games to play and helps us improve what's lacking for our players.\n\nOne of the first troublesome points you've raised is the lootboxes. I'll start a bit farther: we do have paid content in the game, though to prevent overflooding the game with too many or easily accessed guns, paid non-cosmetic content is most often locked away behind Random Kredit Boxes. Kredit weapons are pretty neat, there's no denying that, but they are ever bound in a tight competition with the Arsenal weapons. A brief disclaimer: Arsenal equipment is unlocked via general progression. It's simple: play matches -> earn points (WF$, XP, Arsenal points) -> spend arsenal points on advanced gear.\n\nSmoothly moving on to repair costs, I'd like to clarify \u2014 and you, being a veteran member will likely recall \u2014 that these were introduced alongside rental weapons. This allows us to keep both the newcomers and veterans on the same level, as they're faced with the same expenses. We closely monitor live results and each mission awards enough WF$ (non-premium in-game currency) to repair your gear, unless you happen to equip late-game items for an early-game mission.\n\nMoving up to servers, we've actually committed plenty of efforts to delivering better experience to our worldwide community: there're multiple servers all around the world. Having said that, some players may still experience connectivity issues based on their location, routing and other factors. We're doing our best to provide more opportunities to players in different locations.\n\nIn regards to Anti-Cheat, let me specify that we have our own instead of using a third-party app. It allows us to update it more frequently and thus fish out more violations than an average anti-cheat would. Should you encounter any rulebreakers, make sure to send us a message by tapping \"Report player\" in the game, right during the match. That flags the match for us and we can collect the required data to process your report.\n\nLastly, the community. I'm sure you'd agree that competitive environment in a PvP or PvE game can spark up some negative emotions. It's natural that in a PvP match, one side is going to win whilst the other is going to lose (well, draws aside). Some players manage to keep a cool head whilst others don't. While we try to remain tolerant in all cases, we do not condone excessive inappropriate behaviour and offensive language. You can report players through the same \"report player\" button and select the appropriate category.\n\nHope I've managed to address your key concerns with enough detail \u2014 as much as the reviews allow me to do \u2014 and we'd be happy to hear from you more on our social channels: Discord, Steam hub, forum."}, "15301173": {"recommendationid": "15301173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119631858", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 226509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545517648}, "language": "english", "review": "UPDATE: 5/13/16\nI RAN OUT OF SPACE TO TYPE THINGS\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n***State of \"Pay to win\"***\nKredit items have made their way back into the game somehow, box weapons are now available in kredit boxes as \"earth shaker skins\", it's the same exact weapon just with a different coat of paint and buyable with kredits. There are also now \"berets\" that are reduced repair cost Warlord helmets which are arguably the best in the game. Quite frankly this kinda bothers me, because over the past few years they were trying to steer clear of this sort of thing, only to start bringing it back.\n\nRewards are mostly the same, progression is hindered without buying Mega VIP.\n\n\"fuck you, buy our boosters\".\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n*\nSkilled mission without boosters\n$330-ish (varies depending on region the mission is in) \nAR-GAR rifle permanent purchase\n$42,000\n\nRepair on LMG4 after 12 minutes in skilled game room\n$160\n$330-160=$170\n\n$42,000/$170=247 games, provided you complete every single skilled you run also assuming you do not have any other degradable gear on. At an average of 12 minutes per mission it would take you 50 hours just to be able to get the AR-GAR rifle permanently.\n*\n\n*=reward amounts have changed slightly, but the idea is the same, kinda hard to make money without VIP.\n----------------------------------------\n\n***Cheaters***\nFairfight is in need of serious tweaking, cheating is going back to near pre-fairfight levels, you will find a cheater in every other room throughout the day in PVP.\n\nThere have been actions taken recently to enforce TOS, so be wary.\n\nDO NOT SHARE YOUR ACCOUNT WITH ANYONE\nDO NOT JOKE ABOUT CHEATING IN CHAT\nDO NOT WILLINGLY PLAY WITH CHEATERS (leave the game immediately if you see somebody blatantly cheating)\n\n\n***Lag/bugs/performance***\nThere have been some improvements to recent \"freezes/frame drops\", but they are still present and hinder gameplay massively. Netcode hasn't changed much for the better, so expect to scream at your screen frequently when you see blood pouring out of an enemies face and not getting 1 hit marker. Or \"tanking\" and teleporting. Bugs are everywhere in this game, from the spectator bug to weapons switching themselves back from selecting a smoke.\n\n\n***Gameplay***\n--------------------------\nPVE\n\nAI has degraded massively. PVE isn't nearly as fun as it used to be, it's almost as frustrating as PVP at times. Compared to last year, bots don't behave intelligently or normally like they used to; some walk off of spawn areas on elevated postions and basically suicide, others will walk directly to players and draw their pistols, they also like to twitch in place and have dance parties gathering in circles.\n\nBoss AI is the single most frustrating thing to deal with right now, they went from something players could learn how to deal with to being random and straight up bs sometimes. \n\nHeavy gunners target the nearest visible target or the last player to damage them, when they reload they can turn away from you... if they turn their back against a wall you can't damage them and have to spend that much longer waiting.\n\nMech's have a similar targetting system now, which makes hitting them so much harder when the mech is turning constantly.\n\nThe crown system is really only useful to players without a clan or that isn't able to make it on the clan ladder, the crown weapons are basically just a way to get box level weapons if you don't already have some (you will eventually get at least one by rank 20-30). Crown gear is nice to have but you end up wasting them because of how the rental system works (unless you plan on playing 24 hours a day). The bosses now make getting crowns kinda hard with pugs/random players.\n\nQuickplay matchmaking is based on rank, you won't find rooms easily unless you are higher ranked.\n------------------------------------------\n\nPVP\nSince Ranked matches were implemented the standard browser is VERY empty, making quickplay the only way to play certain game modes.\n\nTDM is your standard game mode. Aside from the small map sizes, the mode itself is fine and enjoyable.\n\nStorm had the potential to be a fun game mode, but coupled with the terrible autobalance system Warface has...\n-Instant respawns; if you get on the bad side of autobalance and your team decides it doesn't want to play the objective, offense and defense is impossible. You can be the best player in your server and it would be impossible to capture a point alone when you have an endless horde of players on defense spawning in as fast as they mash the spacebar.\n\n-Extremely one sided maps and general bad design. Some maps are extremely hard on offense (High Hill).\n\nDestruction isn't very popular, even though it's not a terrible game mode.\n\nPTB is popular among higher ranks, simple and competitive.\n\nFFA isn't as popular as you would think it would be, but it's fun enough.\n\nDomination is probably the least played mode in the game, it isn't that bad, it's just not that good lol.\n\nCapture is another elimination based game mode like PTB.\n\nRanked matches are currently the biggest POS in the game, you get matched with players of any rank, and half the time your opponents just leave the game giving you a free win, and there is absolutely nothing gained from ranking up at all.\n\nPVP currently is not very fun or rewarding due to terrible netcode and cheating, I do not recommend playing anything other than PTB regularly\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n***Weapons/Gear***\nThis game has a hard time differentiating between weapons, and class based gameplay is hindered by gear and certain weapons. There are probably 3 or 4 smg's that are literally the same thing, there is a vest that negates a sniper shot, there's an SMG with the same damage as top tier rifles. \n\nThere is almost no reason at all to use certain weapons in the game if you have a box weapon or a good shop weapon. Nobody is using anything other than the best they have, you won't even see certain weapons being used in the game in PVE or PVP. Weapon stats from worst to best have wayyy too much of a gap... Why are half of the guns in the game even in the game??? (most of these are vendor items)\n\nWarlord gear dominates pretty much every other piece of gear in the game, but you can't maintain them all without VIP. Vest's with explosive protection pretty much save you from 1 grenade and leave you with 10% health to be 1 shot by the next player who see's you. Rapid fire protection sounds good in theory, but is pretty much useless unless somebody is using those bad vendor guns I mentioned.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n***Community/Service***\nThe forums (\"Warface hub\") is basically a place for players to vent their frustration about lag and cheaters. Community moderators have been \"hired\" for a lack of a better word, but they don't have all the answers and are basically there to lock threads and delete posts.\n\nThe support site is basically \"we work whenever we feel like it\" and pre-typed responses. Don't expect a helpful reply in a timeful manner.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n***Final word/TLDR***\nA unique gem in the f2p market that is plagued by bad management and low quality of service. Cheaters are an issue just like most free to play games at some point or another. And \"Pay-to-convience\" in the form of progression.\n\nThe ONLY things that makes this game worth playing is the game mechanics, weapon collections, and (if you are a vet player) the bonds you make with clanmates raging about this game. I won't change my recommendation, because I still think this is a game people should at least experience once. If you can bring yourself to buy the boosters and devote time to the game, PVE at the very least can be enjoyable with friends.\n---------------------------------------", "timestamp_created": 1428729202, "timestamp_updated": 1463185088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 322, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.900062918663024902", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23724790": {"recommendationid": "23724790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067903371", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518106566}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n- Uses a server sided anticheat called Fairfight to prevent hackers\n- Low system requirements but awesome graphics\n- Fast rank system matchmaking with auto team balance feature.

For example, the regular weapons -- the basic ones, ranging from low to mid-high tiers -- are no longer bought permanently but leased out temporarily. That helps you choose how much you want to use the weapon for and thus combine it with your armor repair costs, paying essentially less WF$ (in-game currency) for repairs in general.\n\nApart from that, we've had an Atlas of War introduced to the game with the goal of letting the players pursue some content in a rather thematic fashion: you unlock missions and then complete them, getting various rewards. At the same time, you mix it up with management games / mini-games like Squads and whatnot, letting you have a chance at finding some great loot.\n\nBut hey, if you feel like discussing some of the changes further, drop a comment below or let us know in the Steam hub, I'll gladly get to it and clarify if needed.

It used to be balanced so that if you only played for first time bonus and played well, your repair costs balanced out. You didint really make any money but you werent losing it either. But now the game has tweaked the algorythm so that you have to pay to maintain your gear no matter how you play. You can sit in the back and never get hit and still have a $1000 repair cost while only earning a max of $220 with in-game fist win bonus. Play the same level again and only get $120. So if you dont pay for the boosters, you quickly run out of cash and you have to run the lame level 1 gear. Those around you paying to play will just run the map.

I understand that free to play games are designed to grab at the wallet while you play... but this is literally Pay to Win.\n\nPlayers who drop lots of cash on \"renting\" weapons and gear are all but invincible. While players who spend no money get locked into their spawns and left to suffer.\n\nTLDR version; You might have fun for the first few levels, but eventually you get to a point where if you don't spend your money, you get screwed. And things go south really quick.\n\nNow, let's have some talking points...\n\nFirst, map design; Linear, boring, and pretty much exactly the same concept for each map. A large open center with two paths down either side of the map. Although if you aren't on the PVP team that is winning you may never see outside of your spawn, as all spawns are accessable by the opposing team.\n PVE maps are all pretty much the same as well, a single linear path, with objectives to complete. \nAny CQB area becomes a cluster F@#& as ALL player collision is ALWAYS on. Which means your team mates just keep pushing you back and forth until a grenade shows up and ends your misery.\n\nNetcode? Horrible. I understand excessive rubber banding when my ping has gone further south than antartica, but when I am showing a 42ms ping, why am I getting 1/4 of the way across the map and then suddenly returned to spawn, no death, no reason what so ever? \n\nHow about interface? Nope... it took me three or four goes at loading this game to realize that JUST TO ENTER MY OWN USER NAME, I have to use the games LAUNCHER, and go to the WEBSITE to do so?!?! Why is this NOT in the ACTUAL GAME? There are HIGH LEVEL PLAYERS still using the u_4###### name because they obviously haven't figured this out yet!!!\n\nRenting weapons with in game currency? WHY??? If I had spent my money on a weapon, I want to keep it! I understand a temporary \"loan\" via the leveling system to entice buying, but seriously? If I spend money on a product in a game, I expect to keep it! Also, why is there a gear \"damage\" system that syphons off your base credits constantly so that you are basically stuck without ever gaining the funds to be able to buy even the base level gear that would give you a chance?\n\nI know I haven't posted any reviews before this, and my voice is probably one detracter amoung many fans, but I cannot stay silent about games that are obviously pay to win! If I had to give this a game a rating out of ten, it would go something like this.... 7 out of 10 for basic game play (whcih is kind of fun), but minus 11 for the netcode issues plus the obvious push to try to take my money without delivering a good product.", "timestamp_created": 1519444090, "timestamp_updated": 1519444090, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 118, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.849607288837432861", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43686376": {"recommendationid": "43686376", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090543768", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1522497311}, "language": "english", "review": "Installs my.com spyware on your PC that is almost impossible to completely delete.", "timestamp_created": 1532288888, "timestamp_updated": 1532288888, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 286, "votes_funny": 36, "weighted_vote_score": "0.863333821296691895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 0, "developer_response": "Hello,RazerEdits.

Why downvoting then? \nUnfortunately, as I wrote once in one of the posts - Paying for free to play game is fine and I could do that just like I did for another one I am playing but ffs, guys!\nThe amount of money you would have to spend here to achieve anything is way too much. Especially when bloody game devs are doing everything to make people pay EVEN more. Weapon costs aren't small and once you get enough of money to buy it, you realize repairing it is so expensive. \nRecently they removed an option to buy some guns for permanent use which means that you will need to re-purchase them after some time. This is not fair especially to the players who wants to play for free and achieve something in a normal way, after a much longer time that those who pay. The gap between old (even 1-2 month old) and new players is going to be huge. Just imagine an old player who bought some stuff before that change, permanently and a new dude who can not do that anymore. How much money and time they will need to buy the same stuff?!\n\n\nEnough of talking about P2W. There\u2019s another one thing that I just have to talk about here. Those are hackers.\n\n[h1]Cheaters[/h1]\nI am going to compare Warface to Unturned (I know it\u2019s kinda different game) but it\u2019s just a perfect example. Unturned is also F2P and I played it for a very long time as the admin (still do). \nAll this time I had this feeling that there\u2019s a lot of hackers and other people were just laughing that I am bad, wrong. Once I said there\u2019s probably 40% people cheating and guess what. This magic moment happened when game dev decided to add BattlEye anti-cheat. 8K players got banned in the first two weeks!\nI am pretty sure it would be exactly the same in Warface. You would see hundreds or players banned and crying on the forums. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRi5kZgDwSU I am still kinda new here but I can see some weird crap going on.\n[list][*]People insanely good\n[*]Other skilled / high-rank players complaining about hacks\n[*]Game devs trying something that simply, does not work[/list]\n\nAnd they want money for this? Nope. I don\u2019t think they are that poor. Instead of wasting time on their own anti-hack solutions, they should invest some money in a solid anti-cheat. (At least this one goddamn time).\n\n[h1]Things I love and hate[/h1]\nI absolutely love game modes like Bag and Tag, Storm or Domination. Some of the maps or features, that how things works in this game are just amazing. For example helicopters with spotlight, scanner machine or plane showing the locations of people on Bag and Tag, fighting in the snowstorm on Domination or interacting with some machines. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=914890695 Small things like badges aka challenges, unlocking new guns and stuff - that how many of them there is, sliding or helping a teammate to climb up! It's really awesome. \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=914866776 These things will definitely keep me in the game for some time yet!

I love you as much as I hate you. \n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1] Game is awesome, have some cool features worth of checking out. You can have some fun but hackers, P2W/P2P features and changes made by publishers are going to kill it and make you want to uninstall it.\n\n[I]I\u2019m going to keep this review updated, as long as I am playing the game so game devs have their chance to fix some stuff\u2026\n\u2026 Or ruin even more.[/I]", "timestamp_created": 1493192012, "timestamp_updated": 1493404671, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 95, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835983097553253174", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48092540": {"recommendationid": "48092540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082254338", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546503792}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this before it had steam integration and I played it a lot. So believe in me when I say this is the worst example of a pay to win, slow-ass progression system game you will likely play (which isn't Battlefront 2 in early access).\n\nMULTIPLAYER\n---------------\nNow there are only two REAL modes in this game and that is multiplayer and CO-OP. Now let's just throw multiplayer out of the window.. why you ask? This game is pay to win unless you have the audacity to grind through this game. Now grinding ain't that much for me in a general sense, after all I level multiple accounts and characters on MMOs and MOBAs like league, AQW, runescape and WoW, not to mention I have grinded all of Warframe at this point. So when I say that grinding on Warface is a pain in ass that you might as well be rich and buy it's overpriced items with your \"hard earned money\".\n\nMultiplayer is a complete s***fest since it doesn't matter how good you are at the game, a moderate guy can kick your ass with the paid items. Not to mention the level items require high levels which you can't grind good XP off of multiplayer since so many losses are going to be in your face. Not to mention that XP isn't much of a high amount if you win, since it's mainly based off of your kills. Overall multiplayer shouldn't be touched but it's the only option IMO... why's that?\n\nCOOPERATIVE\n---------------\n\nCooperative is probably the only alternative to multiplayer that is quite popular. You play as a small team infiltrating or defending certain objectives. The only problems are that you barely get any XP from these missions unless you get your first win bonus, not to mention the amount of variety they have in these CO-OP missions is so lacking that it might as well be the exact state of Battlefront one's season pass. Everything get's repetitive. Barely any more maps, same old things you will see. From playing all that crap, there's defending a limo, attacking a helicopter, attacking a big guy, attacking a big fat guy and running through streets like every map is a favela but it isn't. The only intruiging one that I bashed out because it had a challenge was the Tower where you go up a floor and it was basically a survival. Although you would mainly see hackers beat these levels rather than a team's legitness, not saying anyone can't do it because they can with good tactics.\n\nPROGRESSION\n---------------\nNow it is nice to see that the progression did get faster albiet only a tiny bit. XP and Cash are slowly earned through doing missions or multiplayer and if you already did those before today then you will get even less since you get a first win and barely anything else other than.... VIIIIPPPP.\n\nGIVE US MONEY\n-----------------\nLiterally everything in this game is made so you can't be f***** to grind anymore for XP or cash or wait for an item or wait for your team to revive you or anything like that. This game slams the money option in your face everywhere, you want to revive without medic? REVIVE COINS AND YOUR ALL OUT. You want this sweet a** weapon we gave you for 30 days in a daily login bonus THEN PAY US YOU LIL'B*****. No one wants to spend money on a free to play game unless that game is worth playing. A good example of not slamming it in your face is League of Legends and Warframe. These games don't slam the \"pay us you lil'b****\" option since nearly everything in those games can be grinded out and not so hard that you feel like skipping, They put good effort into their games and they even reward you daily with not just login bonuses but more. Whereas Warface only has daily login and it usually has the SLAM \"PAY US\" already in each one.\n\nREPAIRING\n-----------\nNow anyone likes the feel of getting that amazing weapon or armour piece that they took so long to grind for, but no one in the entire world wants to use their hard earned cash that they just acquired to repair some shit they grinded for, you might as well stick with default items if you want to efficiently grind this game. Think about it, on average every game I played, about 10% of the cash I got was used for repairing... ONE ITEM. And this is without the first win bonus. The only way to get more from cash is doing multiplayer but free to play players don't like getting their a** handed by pay to win fa*****.\n\nMy Honest Opinion That Could Save This Game and The Reality\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf they did these things, the game would be on it's way to a peak game...\n\nRemove\n======\nRemove repairing bu*****\nStop slamming us with little incentives to buy your overpriced items and DLC\n\nChanges\n=======\nReduce prices and give daily discounts\nAdd more maps to cooperative\nIncrease XP and Cash rewards to make the grind hell more enjoyable but not to easy\nAdd a seperate multiplayer mode where you and others have default items and armour making everything balanced\nGive more bonus rewards to teammates who help out their team with their abilities (more XP and cash for helping team with your class abilities)\nAnd finally have the XP and cash output balance between having won the game and having kills or assists or team helping. If one wasn't sufficient, it wont drop the output that much and you can just get more out of the other entries. For example having lost a game doesn't mean you should have a massive loss in XP or Cash, just have the Win XP/Cash output be less significant in this output of the game.\n\nReality\n========\nNow the harsh reality comes in when you put these factors in, the majority playing multiplayer are pay to win fa***** who waste money in this game and it's a quite a lot of people, hence these a**-hat developers will never change the game to make this less of a cash grab. So the majority of these changes which could completely make the game barable will never happen...\n\nAfter all the years playing this game, I rate this a 1/10.", "timestamp_created": 1546597829, "timestamp_updated": 1546597829, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 94, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.828283011913299561", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 0, "developer_response": "Hi there, thanks for sharing your review with us!\n\nCould you please elaborate as to what made you feel that way?\n\nThere are two branches of elite equipment available in the game: Kredit and Arsenal.

Admins never follow up on reports.\n-Purchasable weapons limited to what you can already unlock through VP.\n-Repair cost often more than the WF$ you can earn by winning a match even if you come in first place.\n\nSo basically this is what it boils down to. This game has a lot of potential. But I don't think the devs are ever going to do anything more with it. Crytek games were basically made to show off the CryEngine and it's capabilities. This game has a lot of balancing flaws that I don't see getting fixed any time soon. One of them is the annoying fact that the in-game repair costs will eventually eat away all your WF$ if you play for more than a few hours at a time. Regardless of how well you do in-match. I often place 1st or 2nd on each match and only earn a measly $200-$350 WF. But my repairs cost me in excess of $400 each match. So you do the math. Once my money runs out my weapon degrade and I am forced to revert to the stock weapons which suck so horribly that they're pointless to play with at higher levels. So I'm forced to log in the for \"First Win of the Day\" Bonuses on each game type every day, play and win a match in each type, then call it quits for the day. So I basically get shoved into a corner of keep playing and end up paying real money for fake digital money, or not play hardly and try to build up enough in-game currency so I can play for a few hours at a time. Not to mention whenever I do play I can barely get any experience or money because a lot of times the servers are so horribly balanced that I just end up getting game-r-aped by super high-level people who head shot every single person they kill and win matches with 60/10 K/D ratios. Most of them aren't cheating they're weapons and gear are just so OP because they pay to win.\n\nThe player balancing issue could be solved if they added more ranking channels for mid-echelon players. Like the first 10 levels you are playing against other level 10 or lower people then you get moved to the \"experienced\" player channel that ranges from 10-80+ or howerever high the level cap is. So you've got noobs, okay players, and game-gods all on the same servers. This results for very unfair and unbalanced gameplay. \n\nWill I keep playing it? Probably Idk... I'm getting so frustrated with this game, I'm wondering if it's even worth the time anymore. It seems okay at first but once you get into the nitty gritty, this game has a lot of issues that aren't being addressed by the devs at all and will ultimately be the undoing of this game.

When I saw the trailer I was very confident and excited about this little title crytek have decided to launch. It showed me pretty interesting mechanics and things I have never seen in a free to play game. And when i actually saw that crytek made it i jumped up and i told myself : this means a new era for free to play games. \nWell , i was wrong . I was so very wrong.\n\n[h1] The game [/h1]\n\nThe game focuses on straight infantry combat. You start the game and jump right in the tutorial with no explanation about what is going on . Some female voice tells you everything that you need to know about classes , movement mechanics , weapons etc. After you finish the tutorial you get a weapon which only lasts a week ( I will talk about this MAJOR problem later on ) . You get to choose whether you want to jump in a game through matchmaking or through dedicated servers. I truly recommend dedicated servers because you can find a game faster and you skip the 20 minutes wait time until you find a server that is empty in matchmaking.\n\n[h1] The gameplay [/h1] \n\nThe gameplay itself has some next-gen elements in it , such as : helping a teammate climb a higher structure by boosting him up , reviving ( not really next-gen but oh well ) and also [b] SLIDING [/b] . I said SLIDING in bold text because i want to point out that it is OP ( OverPowered )  , meaning that when you slide , you can also shoot. This makes it so that when you see a dude , slide and shoot towards him and he's dead. No matter his skill , level etc , he will not notice you and you will get an easy kill. It was slightly nerfed since i first played this game in the closed beta , but it is still OP. \nThe game also has classes , which are primitive and remind me of Battlefield 4 . You get the same generic classes you see in every shooter ( medic , sniper , engineer , and rifleman ) . The one that somehow stands out is the rifleman , which is somehow a support from Battlefield , but with the ability to give himself ammo without droping it . \nAnyway , you've probably played other shooters and you know how they handle. \nThe gunplay is very unbalanced. You start out with some shitty weapons which are actually waterguns because all their stats are set to 1 ( out of 100 ) , and all of your enemies are higher levels with weapons that seem like very small miniguns combined with Counter Strike AWP's . In other words , you will lose every single battle if you don't have proper cover. \nThe maps are very small . Actually , they are smaller than Nuketown in Call of Duty . No need for more words here\n\n[h1] The main problem with the game [/h1]\n\n[b] MICROTRANSACTIONS EVERYWHERE!!!! [/b]\nYes , you will be swarmed in little ads with weapons or clothing that doesn't do anything . These items will continue to appear on the screen until you buy them . And the worst part ? You will struggle to kill and kill and kill for money , money , money , and when you have enough money to buy another shitty item with all the stats 2 , you will rage and throw your PC out the window when you will notice that it will only be available for one week . Of course , until you buy a Premium account that will cost extra money ( real money ) \n\n[h1] The final verdict [/h1]\nOverall , i DO NOT recommend this game. Don't let the screenshots and trailers fool you. It's not worth it. It will never be , because this is what the corporations do to the developers: They make them create unfinished games like this one\n\n[h1] 3.5/10 [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1412963666, "timestamp_updated": 1420976117, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1603, "votes_funny": 145, "weighted_vote_score": "0.887784719467163086", "comment_count": 108, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48680871": {"recommendationid": "48680871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150290963", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 97779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 41, "last_played": 1550799704}, "language": "english", "review": "Back in 2014 when i first started this game i wouldve recommended it in a heartbeat.

I instantly became hooked and met some of the most out going people on there. At one point, people were sending extra controllers to eachother because controllers were breaking from playing so much. December 3, 2014 Xbox 360 Warface was shutdown after people put hundreds of dollars into the game. Being a huge let down to all of us dedicated players, some of us moved onto the pc version. Some stayed some didn't (Most people didn't) I was one of the ones who stayed. The point i'm trying to make is I am as loyal as loyal could get to this game. But do you think any of the devs listen to what needs to be fixed and what needs to be balanced?\n\n-Me- Excuse me devs, but um some of the guns are very unbalanced and they need a buff or just nerf the op ones\n-Devs- Yea we got you were going to add 102 new gold guns next month so its more balanced\n-Me- No no I don't think you get it.

its a free-to-play game that is so worth getting\n- [u]Gameplay[/u] - the game has overall smooth gameplay with easy to learn controls\n- [u]Co-op Missions[/u] - I've previously had this game on Xbox and after all the time playing it I've almost never played Versus and mostly played Co-op missions, every day never Co-op missions drop 1 easy, 2 normal, 2 hard, and 1 extreme, to get to the next difficulty you have to beat the previous ones, you play with 4 other people taking on tons of the Blackwood forces in unique maps and have 1 or 2 bosses to deal with, mostly Heavy Gunners, but also Giant Mechs, what makes the Co-op the most fun is that everyone can't go one class and you have to work together with you different abilities to survive \n- [u]Special Operations[/u] - everyday you'll be awarded a curtain amount of operation coins that give you access to Cyber Zombies and more, adding this gives more variety to the game\n- [u]Unique Classes[/u] - this game has 4 unique classes for ever gamemode each with their own specials abilities and and unique loadouts, 1st you have the ammo man, equipped with a assault rifle, pistol, knife, grenades, and ammunition, which you can use to give your self and teammates more ammo, 2nd class and my personal favorite is the medic, instead of an assault rifle he comes equipped with a shotgun, and everything else except for the ammunition, he comes with a medic pack(to heal yourself and other) and defibrillator to revive dead players, the 3rd class is the Engineer, which comes with a SMG different knife and no pistol, but he comes with land mines, and Armor(to restore to teammates and your self), 4th and final class is the Sniper, comes with a Sniper and regular loadout, and nothing special\n- [u]SafeHouse[/u] - this is small feature you may not ever notice but once you do you'll be happy you did your hideout is basically your house with a training course and pool table, dart board, tv, and everything else a normal house would have\n- [u]No Glitches[/u] - game runs absolutely smooth, not a single crash or glitch I've experienced\n- [u]Versus[/u] - or multiplayer, is extremely balanced with lots maps and detail\n- [u]Graphics[/u] - game has great graphics that keep you in the moment\n- [u]No FPS Drops[/u] - in my playtime I've never had a drop of FPS and as I said runs smooth\n- [u]Soundtrack[/u] - the soundtrack for this game is amazing and will get your blood pumping\n\n[h1][b][u]Cons[/u][/b][/h1]\n- [u]Limited Unlocks?[/u] - this is really stupid where you can rent weapons for a limited amount of time, or you can permanently buy it which is the obvious choice to make\n- [u]Kredits[/u] - these cost real money and are a lot of the currency for the game\n- [u]Crowns[/u] - WTF are these Crowns for, these things are extremely hard to get, if your lucky you can get about 8 per Co-op mission but to purchase anything with them you need like 900 but the biggest bs about this is that Crowns only buy timed items, meaning that you can buy a sexy orange gun with it but and only use it for a day before it disappears from your inventory so what's the ####### point of these then, it would make sense if you actually lets us buy permanent items with these\n- [u]Versus Needs More Game Modes[/u] - versus needs a lot more game modes as there are some but you need way more of a variety to keep you playing, though the game has a lot to offer so this isn't a big issue for me\n- [u]G-Face Account[/u] - I don't like the idea of having to make an account to play this game though most Free-To-Play games have this so I'll just deal with it so it's not that bad\n- [u]Lost EVERYTHING[/u] - For starters this is a update as of 6/28/17 I stopped playing the game for a bit then I logged in at a friends house and ALL of my data in the game has been wipped, and wow wtf, considering there's a G-face account I had to sign back into why didn't it save my data and all those hours of work down the drain, so just be careful still good but that's a MAJOR problem that needs to fixed so just be wary while playing the game\n\n[h1][b][u]Final Verdict[/u][/b][/h1]\nThis game is amazing considering the pure fact thats its free and its hard finding negative reasons to give in the review and its hard to not get this game, my final verdict for this game is a 10/10 for Free-To-Play games its flat out amazing and even if it wasn't free i'd still buy it since its just so good, so stop what your doing and make sure to get this game right now before you regret it!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1453786853, "timestamp_updated": 1498670814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 145, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.838223636150360107", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29707173": {"recommendationid": "29707173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078854135", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486328569}, "language": "english", "review": "Well they deleted my account...so i deleted the game...", "timestamp_created": 1486257169, "timestamp_updated": 1486257169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 121, "votes_funny": 150, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835132837295532227", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35805174": {"recommendationid": "35805174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062144269", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 6336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511028975}, "language": "english", "review": "Dead thing now. \nYou literally lose money when you play.

This also means that your permanent weapons will slowly break because you can't earn enough money to fix them, forcing you to play at high levels with the starter weapons. It just won't be fun at all after my precious TWM breaks.  You have to pay to get good or permanant guns now. I saved up 7,000 dollars, only to see it dwindle away as I played, because of not earning enough thanks to my.com, and expensive upkeep. Second, lots of people are having their accounts deleted. My.com made Warface buggier than an ant hill (at least the launcher, 60% of the time I can't launch the game).

New weapons introduced in each updates following the editor's change were really unbalanced (2 different class' weapon can be used as they were only one). They keep telling us that this game is not Pay2win... It's not true from what I can actually see. High tier weapons needs time (but a lot of time !) to be unlocked and compared to the weapons that can only be acquired with Kredit, something is still missing. Unlocked weapons is still low powered when facing to the \"Pay2Win\" weapons. Of course, pro players can handle them without any problem, but please think about the new players... will they be capable of acquiring these weapons ? Not at all, they need to pay (the best option for them) or they need to play a lot... Overall, this game balance is not perfect...far away from that...

But please make a difference between the needed money to run it AND complete cupidity just to farm money from our hands. DON'T put a price where we shouldnt have price and put a decent amount of Kredit where u seem fair to add (Weapon box, skin box,etc) And last, put the price u want for the \"extension\" (Steam bindle, Operation,etc.) Btw, the idea of operation is a good start (like CSGO's Operation) but unlike CSGO, Warface doesnt have 100000 players everyday online, 4000 is like the max cap for Warface. Think BIGGER, but do it steps by steps.

And the list of Cons is quite considerable.\n\nCons:\nPoor mobility. Yes there are mechanics such as sliding and climbing but its very sluggish. Similar to early battlefield games. For me the more fluid you can make your movement mechanics the higher the skill ceiling in your game is. \n\nWhether or not you get into a game with a great connection or a terrible one seems to be a complete crap shoot. You can select your region which gives the illusion of a good connection but it will still connect you to people way farther away than it should which results in one of you having a terrible connection. This results in you seemingly getting shot around corners or can make you feel like you get deleted after emptying a clip into someone. \n\nThis game is a complete money-sink. Some games do the in-game purchases in a respectable and fair way. This is not one of those games. From the get-go you can tell that the primary concern of the devs is finding different ways to push players to their limit with their snail paced progression system. There are a good amount of different guns, equipment, and attachments in the game but you can only work towards unlocking one thing at a time through levelling up. This means if you intend to play this game without spending money you had better be ready for a very long grind. It took me 9 games to unlock a single scope and throughout those 9 games no progress was made toward permanently unlocking anything else. Throughout the grind you have the option to spend in game currency on temporary weapons that you can use but the money goes fast. You better hope you wind up choosing a gun that turns out to be good or you'll have wasted precious currency for literally nothing. \n\nOf course since you progress through the game seemingly in slow motion, taking forever to unlock any equipment even close to being top tier, this opens up the opportunity for pay-to-win scenarios. With money you can practically skip the grind altogether by being able to buy currency boosters, guns, gear, crates and skins which can put you miles ahead of anyone who doesn't feel like going bankrupt for the sake of doing well in a video game.\n\nThese are my big issues with the game. There are still many many little things about the game which will slowly drive you insane if you choose to push through. \n\nSome of these include:\nshitty prone mechanics\ncertain game modes are completely dead or unplayable\nI've heard cheating tends to go unpunished\nlong respawn timers. I don't see what this could possibly add to a game like this.\nspeaking of respawning, its quite common to spawn surrounded by aggressive players because the respawn points are fixed and not static\nthe gameplay is divided unnecessarily into 4 different classes with each class providing some part of what you would expect every character to have such as healing after a gun fight.\nThe matchmaking system leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nThe verdict:\nFor a free game warface is good for a day or two of play. If you want to persist past that you'll probably want to invest in some boosters to get you through some of the horribly painstaking grind. But before you consider spending money on this game you should ask yourself these questions: Should you have to pay to have a consistently enjoyable time in this game? Does this game actually deliver an experience worth paying for? Would you be better off spending that money on a different game with a much higher production value and level of developer consideration? \n\nTL;DR The game has its positives but they just dont outweigh the many many negatives.

There's no denying that Warface is a progression-based game: you have to level up your toon and expand the armory, build up a solid pool of guns to play with. Nevertheless, we've got a plethora of systems in place that let you enjoy gameplay while you are levelling. If you go back to level 1 after you've been 'up there', it's definitely going to be upsetting, but overall a first-time experience is by far a rather enjoyable ride \u2014 speaking of levelling, that is.\n\nYou raise a solid point: we have three 'base' currencies in Warface: the traditional Experience Points (self-explanatory), Warface Dollars (basic currency for buying/renting gear), Vendor Points (much like XP points, just for unlocking advanced gear).

I just downloaded it to try it now that its on steam to see if there are any big changes and here is what I found.\n\nThe game still has the same horrible cash shop as before and I really dislike cash shops like this where you can buy weapons and gear for real money, or you can buy them with ingame credits that takes a while to earn and the weapon only last for about 7 or 14 days (alot of guns are permanent though). The game does have decent balance between all the guns but I still don't like the cash shop system it has and you need to repair weapons. \n\nI play a bunch of different games so I don't have the time to no life in this game for 7 or 14 days and grind. The best kevlar and helmet can only be bought for the co-op currency and only last 14 days. That system really sucks for me since if I buy something that last 14 days but I only play 7 days then I obviously lose on it. I am also not interested in the co-op part of the game. \nThe cash shop also seems to rotate a few weapons every 2 weeks that are only available for real money and only last 7 days. \n\nThe game has very small maps, granted some people might actually like that but I really hate these incredibly small maps where you can spawn and throw a grenade to the enemy spawn, it also just encourages a bunch of nade spamming and camping and spawn killing.\n\nThe dedicated / peer 2 peer / lobby server system is a good idea with potential but as it is right now after you play 1 map it takes forever for the next one to start on most servers because people always seem to leave and the host has to start each new match manually it seems but this could be cause the game is in beta. There are also always people that lag in every single match.\n\nThe games graphics are not that good on max settings. I know graphics are not everything but when they keep using it as a selling point and even on steam they keep bragging about \"cryteks cry engine\" for example this is what it says under features of this game: \"Expect the best \u2013 Crytek's trademark quality meets free-to-play gaming\" You kinda expect them to deliver but they really don't, this game looks like its from 2008. \n\nSo to sum it up: Game has bad cash shop, small maps with nade spam and campers and spawn killing, lobby server system with hosts that is buggy, laggy and slow. Graphics are not as good as they advertise them to be. Overall \"feel\" and \"smoothness\" of the game is really weird in my opinion and I just don't enjoy it that much. If you play this game then please look at the characters movements and stuff in the game and you'll see how sluggish, weird and awkward everything is.\n\nKeep in mind this is just my opinion of the game, feel free to download the game since its f2p and try it for yourself, I am sure plenty of people will like this game.\n\nOh for all the people defending the game and saying its in beta, then yeah it is, but its been in beta for like 1 year now and the same problems exist now as they did back then, so to me that is no valid excuse.

Sorry, I have a job guys...\n\nAnd, let me tell you, those premium items are WAY better then the starting gear. They offer a huge advantage and the higher difficulties for the tower challenges demand those premium items.\n\nThe catch? While premium items are superiorly powerful in every manner, you only to get experience it for a day. Either the time limit will expire or it will take another week's worth of credits to repair them enough to use for another, singular day.\n\nWhile grinding out said costs to return to \"premium\" items you will face those that are \"premium\" which will beat you down and make you lose resulting in less credits and more grind.

I first started playing this game when it was up for open beta on the Xbox 360 many years ago. I even played with the main developer if my memory serves. I recognized it had issues then but knew it was still in development and needed time to be refined. Not long after I broke my Xbox and switched to PC. A few years later I remembered this game and redownloaded it. I was shocked to see the problems hadn't been fixed. So lets run down a few. \n\nBad level design: The co-op levels are well designed and feel chaotic and organic enough to serve a mission format. I have no complaints about that. The Versus maps, however, are atrocious. They are cramped, full of easy to exploit lapses in design like a sniper position in the shipyard map that allows you to snipe the enemy team's spawn, poor spawn placement allowing spawnkilling to be not just easy but encouraged to gain the advantage at the expense of any chance for the team being camped to ever recover, not optimized for the classes allowing snipers to be effective in all maps at any distance, and horribly cluttered. I feel like I'm playing a custom CS:GO map made by a guy explicitly to give himself an advantage. \n\nPoor weapon design: the weapons feel pretty much identical, not like you could ever test them all seeing as they're basically completely hidden behind paywalls, but I'll get to that in a moment. The 7 rifles I've managed to play with were basically identical and somehow felt like they were worse the longer it took for me to obtain them. Despite having changes in their stats according to a very unhelpful graph displayed below them, I never felt like I was at any significant advantage for changing from one gun to another. Aside from that the guns show barely any disadvantage for the method of use you choose to use. You can hit enemies from across the map with a shotgun and inflict enough damage to kill them after 4-5 rounds. The sniper rifile is easily aimed at close range and can be used to shoot at whatever range you require of it. The rifles can be fired like sniper rifles much easier than should ever be possible. There's a handgun gifted to you after logging in a few days in a row that is completely unbeatable. Short range, mid range, long range, it's practically a one hit kill. How is that balanced? \n\nThe Community: I can understand the lack of voice chat. It is much easier to maintain a less toxic environment. That being said, the lack of voice chat has inadvertently allowed creative trolls to come up with more nefarious ways of causing chaos and annoyance, and the game has given them many tools to do so. One of the singleplayer missions requires all the players get onto a platform that lowers down to move on to the next part of the mission. All players must be on it to progress. So as you'd expect, one player chose to simply run in circles a few feet away from the platform for 9 minutes before I gave up and quit. Ok, so how is a troll being a troll a complaint for the game? Well, the game removed our only means to communicate with him, and our only means of mitigating the issue, namely kicking him. Yes. The game gives you the option to vote kick but doesn't allow you to do it if you're far enough in the mission. How on earth does that make any sense?\n\nMatchmaking: I should not be forced to play against players several levels above me who have had significantly more practice and playtime than I could ever hope to get. I'm a level 4, playing in a game of level 1s and half a team of level 12s and higher. Oh and to top it all off, we're outnumbered because the matchmaking doesn't bother to balance the game as it goes along. TF2 and CS:GO do this. I get matchmaking isn't perfect in those games either. I've played games where it's 7 vs 3. The problem arises when it's consistent. I have played more games in extreme imbalance than I have balanced. This should not be that bad. \n\nMonetization: ...Jesus christ. I cannot even begin to force myself to write out all the blatant pay to win practices this game employs. I'm talking Battlefront and Clash Of Clans levels of pay to win. \"Kredits\" that allow you to buy armor that increases your resistance to damage, boots that make you faster, boosters for your guns, and XP boosters. Hell, even revives for Co-Op are pushed for you to buy. I guarentee they would charge by the bullet if they could. I get they need to make money. That's fine. So, then, how is TF2 so successful? Is it because the only thing you can buy with real money is cosmetics, accessories, and weapons that may appear to be better but have downfalls that keep them balanced? I suppose we'll never know. \n\nConclusion: This game is free and I want a refund. I am profoundly disappointed in the direction this game has gone in the years between the beta and now. I do not recommend you download this game even if it is free. Do not buy any in game items. This game is an absolute waste of time and energy. I gave it every chance and was let down every time by it.

However, though it may be a free to play, you will suck if you don't invest money into the game, the decent gear costs too much to use now and they pretty much give you complete garbage weapons to use if you dont buy K (In game currency). This wouldn't be so bad had it not been that even if you want to buy the good weapons, you have to try to buy them with random boxes using real money. Yes, you have to gamble real money for decent weapons........... face palm. Worst part about the whole thing is the fact that your odds of getting the weapon are 1 in a thousand, and the boxes cost about 60 cents each. I have invested over 60 dollars, and have not recieved any weapons from the random boxes. I will never invest another dollar into the game, and beg you not to waste your money, instead just go buy a full content game.\n\nHad it not been for this major flaw, the game is actually well put togeather. Good graphics, runs great. \nOne last warning, Hit register in the game is officially the worst of any fps game you will play, I have a 3 white bar connection which is decent, but anybody with a redbar connection (which is about 90 percent of the players) will tank MOST bullets, and they can shoot you behind walls do to latency.

The maps tend to be fun and worthwhile investigating, and the class system adds an interesting dimension that sets the game apart from it's other free to play counterparts. \n\nCheating hasn't been an issue for me - only occasionally have I played with actual cheaters, and even then there's a game function where you can vote kick them. So far that's always worked for me.\n\nAnd I don't think it's a pay to win game yet - in fairness, you can get decent equipment just by playing the game - but it takes serious effort. Unlocking guns is done randomly from a pool of guns from all classes - meaning if (like me) you tend not to play all the classes, you still need to unlock their guns before you can get to yours. It's a pain, but doesn't ruin the game. Whilst a fair amount of the shop's content can't be obtained without using real money, the majority of that content is essentially useless - stuff like skins. \n\nHowever it does seem to be heading more and more in the P2W direction: for example, warface used to have this really cool \"auction house\" where players could sell guns for in-game currency - allowing you to get hold of nice guns without blowing real money on them. However, my.com got rid of that, as it was loosing them money. If you want the nicest guns (with stuff like extra damage against cyborgs - crucial in the spec ops missions) then you need to use random boxes - most of which are obtainable by using real money. These actually are a total scam! Again, my.com changed things up - now there's a far higher chance of getting temporary weapons, and a crazy low chance of getting permanent - for almost every box the chance of getting a permanent weapon is 1%, and getting the gold version 0.1%. \n\nOverall it does seem like the game has taken a huge swing towards temporary/rental guns, something I really dislike. I love the security of amassing an armoury, and for me renting a gun is never as enjoyable. It also feels like a ploy to try and get you to play more - you rent a gun for a certain amount of real time, meaning you feel compelled to play for all of that time so as not to waste your money. \n\nIn the final update, there was also a penalty added for quitting the quick team matches, stuff like time delays before joining new matches, and probation periods. This feels,, iky too. For me, quitters haven't been an issue in the quick team matches - there's a fairly constant flow of people in and out, and if anything I've found this just keeps the gameplay stimulating - swapping tactics for new players. I've never had a team that I think has lost due to quitters. \nConversely, there are numerous occasions when I want to quit a match - I try to value real life over virtual, so if food's ready, or something else beckons then I'll usually quit. Realising there's now a penalty for that seems, slightly invasive and needy. If anything it's probably going to make me spend less time on the game, as I'll be reluctant to start a match if there's a slight possibility I'll need to leave it. \n\nWhere this penalty would be useful would be in the Co-Op missions - where quitting (for me) is a constant issue: so many times I've reached a boss fight, and found that most of the team have quit. As these missions are longer anyway, and are therefore more of an obvious commitment, I think it would actually be really useful to have a penalty on these ones.\n\nNow the moan's out of my system I feel freer to re-iterate that I do still think this is a good game. Whilst I'm annoyed by recent changes, and am afraid that the game is going to further deteriorate - at the end of the day, I'm still playing the game. It's still fun, if annoying sometimes, and I think it's important to remember that it is free! The developers have created something I enjoy spending my time on, and it seems a little petty to dig into them as if I have some sense of entitlement just because I've invested time into the game. \n\nSo yeah - download it: hopefully you'll find it fun, and if not, hey, it was only 5 mins instillation time you wasted. \n(And presumably how ever long it took you to read this atrociously long review.

After 1250+ hours I can't really say I reccomend or don't this game, a lot has changed since my.com took it over, repair costs used to be less then money earned in-game but not so much anymore. Now you have to either buy vip boosters to actually make money, (which I do not mind so much, as I've played the game for 3 years I feel its fair i support them for giving 1000+ hours of entertainment to me, I just do it on a subscription type basis, ill pay for boosters on a 30 day span)  but for a new player this is definitely a turn off to the game. I'll give some Pro's and Con's.\n\nPros:\n1. Runs excellent even on potatos as expected by Crytek\n2. Great realistic animations\n3. Plenty of content to play with in the game (9 pvp gamemodes, Spec-Ops, and Co-op missons)\n4. 2 separate server rooms for \"Rookies\" and \"Professional Players\" this gives you a good enough amount of time to learn the maps/gamemodes without getting destroyed if there weren't separate servers. \n\nCons:\n1. By far my biggest complaint is the servers, for some reason they have Hong Kong as an NA server which makes no sense, so you either get stuck in a hong kong lobby or you'll get chinese players in for example, a washington lobby at 200+ ping, they will tank an entire clip to the head and not die. \n2. Poor marketing - I feel this game has a bad stigma around it because of my.com now, but it has always had potential, perhaps if the fanbase was larger they wouldnt need to do all this p2w stuff now.\n3. Extremely low drop rates for Kredit Box guns, as well as Warface Dollar boxes, 1% chance for Normal gun, 0.01% chance for Gold equivalent. Ridiculous. If I'm paying hard earned money I'd ATLEAST like a higher chance of getting something useful, instead of 1000+ days of flash bang that i'll never use. \n4. Most maps are pretty generic, if you want to play on better maps focus on playing PTB, Storm and Blitz, IMO those have the best maps. \n5.

Four classes; rifleman, engineer, medic and sniper with their class specific abilities you can find more info about from Internet.\n2. Three in game currencies; warface dollars (in game money), crown points (will tell you later), and kredits (real world money).\n3. A dosen gamemodes every first person shooter game has, for example; plant the bomb, team death-match and the newest addition, battle royale mode.\n4. Weapons (primary, secondary and melee) with attachements and armor gear for your character.\n5. Maintenance system for weapons and armor, repaired with warface dollars.\n\n\tFor new players, the honest recommendations:\n\n- It's free, you don't have to pay to play the game but you won't either get access to all content available in the game. These things can range from \"Random Kredit Box weapons\" (and their achievement stripes) to \"Global Operations\" (DLC like events).\n\n-It has both Versus (PvP) and Coopperative (PvAI) modes. Versus mode includes quickplay, ranked mode, and custom games. Co op mode also has longer missions called Spec ops which are more story driven experience rather than fast paced, straightforward coop missions. \n\n- It has good ESports potential with all the allowed weapons and armor avalable for every player in Tournament server, which makes the competitive play fair and balanced.\n\n- It has a progression system for player, known as \"vendor\" system and generic \"rank\" (not to be confused with ranked-versus mode). Vendors include unlockable weapons, armor pieces, and attachements, which of all you can unlock by just playing the game.\n\n- Runs on Cryengine 3 with DirectX 9.0c, meaning the optimization and graphics are very good, but also support for older hardware and laptops. Some AMD (GPU) users are rumoured to encounter freezes in game but I cannot confirm that as Nvidia user, go ahead and give a shot.\n\n\tThen the critique:\n\n- The game is indeed P2W because most random kredit box weapons are statistically better than free ones, with the exception of SAI GRY AR-15 assault rifle. There are \"crown weapons\" that are better versions of kredit box weapons, but they cost rare ingame currency known as \"crowns\" that can only be earned from coop mode. They are rentable meaning that once they expire, you have to buy them again.\n\n- Random kredit boxes are loot boxes that contain timed weapons, xp, progression boosters, and ultimately the main prize; a kredit box weapon that is generally better than any other free weapon. However, the odds to get the main prize permanently is super small 1%, and 0.1% for golden variant some weapons might have! As the boxes' name tells you, you have to buy the boxes to have a slight chance to get the main prize, which is GAMBLING in its purest. Fortunately boxes with golden variants will grant you the gold version once you have bought 1000 pcs of that particular box! Unfortunately this golden gun has cost you over 500\u20ac if dropped from the 1000th box... \n\n- Inaccurate in-game statistics for weapons, attachements, armors, ect. \nThe in-game stats don't represent the real performance of most guns for example there's no accurate values for recoil, reload speed, weapon swapping speed, min/max spread, damage drop, minimum damage, pellet count (shotguns), random box odds, or repair costs. Also some attachements have \"hidden\" stats such SIG Sauer P266C's \"Custom Pistol Silencer\" (that reduces the nowhere mentioned damage drop by 50%) or \"Advanced SMG Scope\" from rare vendor attachement category (that reduces the nowhere mentioned min/max spread of smg by 20% while aiming). \nSome community members have hacked into the game files to find us gamers the real stats for each of weapons, which are available for readers in the community maintained wiki of Warface.\n\n- Cheaters\nThe game uses the CIS side publisher, Mail.RU's private anti-cheat aka MRAC which effectiveness is unknown since possibly banned cheaters are cencored for the sake of their privacy. If someone cheats, he/she almost certainly won't get banned immediately from the game but the players are forced to report the cheater via in game report tool (which effectiveness is questionable at least), or by submitting a ticket on publisher's support-page with proper proof (a dosen screenshots or a video).\n\n- Repair costs\nThere are still weapons and armor that are too expensive to be used by free2play players; every profit they make will drain to gear maintenance, which forces them to buy progression boosters only available via kredits.\n\n- Lack of regional servers\nPlayers who connect from the other side of the globe to EU server will make the matches go nuts due to unnecessary complexity of lag compensation and hit registeration calculations to also favor laggers. In worst cases, players teleport all over the place, and back to where they stood, or tank point-plank shotgun blast without showing any hit markers.\n\n- Bugs which still haven't been fixed, yet being reported. The Steam version of the game which is basically EU/NA server, is very buggy due to the previous publisher's (Crytek Frankfurt) changes in the client compared to RU server which is apparently Crytek Kiev's main development/test platform with numerous PTSes available for russian players. Possible reason for this propably is because the debugging/bug tracking being also done with RU version despite bugs existing only within EU/NA server client.", "timestamp_created": 1511949607, "timestamp_updated": 1511950137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732954978942871094", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 0, "developer_response": "Dear cryprotree, thank you so much for such a profound, well-thought and logically structured review.
