It was fall of 2015 when I got it. I was excited, to say the least. The hair on my head was long still, as I had not gotten it cut in a while, so forgive me for not always remembering exactly what I had seen. It got in the way often.\nWhen I bought it I was told by my best friend Renee Ellis that I should also purchase counter strike: source and Half Life two. Now I'd never played these games in the past, but I wanted to try them, and not just buy them for the graphics and textures for Gmod. With CS: Source, it was fun. There were quite a few hackers though, which quickly became tiresome. I soon uninstalled it after. \nAfter this, I began Half-Life, which was where things took a sinister turn. I was unprepared for this entirely. \nIt was a sunny setting, with clouds and fluffy dogs everywhere! I had heard the rumors that this game was only for hardcore gamers who like a gritty story, but was not expecting such a cute setting. Maybe my friends were trolling. This was weird. I played an hour into it, when it crashed. The error report was telling me to:\n\"Restart the program.... or else.\"\nThis was weird. So I tried again, only to find another error appear on screen and it crash again! The report got worse this time around. \n\"Don't close me this time.\"\nI was confused. So I closed it again. Decided third time's the charm and verified my game files and tried again. But alas, another crash. This report sent chills down my spine though. \n\"Don't turn around.\"\nI quickly spun around, but was not ready for the shock of a man standing behind me. It was not my step dad here to beat me with his belt for yelling too loudly, but it looked almost like.... Gabe Newell. I asked him,\n\"Gabe, is that you?\"\nHe responded with spit coming out of his mouth.\n\"RESTART THE GAME!\"\nI ran from my chair screaming for my mom to help me. She came downstairs into the basement I live in to ask me\" What's wrong my sweet banana?\"\nI was crying and pointed at where the man was standing previously and he had vanished! I held her hand and pulled her to the computer to show her the error message or try to launch the game again, but the game was uninstalled and my computer was on the Steam library page. Had it been just my imagination?! I checked my recent games and nothing. That was when I checked google on any records of Half Life two and instead it was just things about how the franchise was cancelled and similar incidents occurring. \n\"How weird\" I thought to myself. \n\nA few days passed by and I tried Garry's Mod finally. It was a great game that made me laugh like \"hoo hoo\" and \"hee hee\" often. I have many hours in it now. And all my friends are bored of it. But I still play. Because of that night.

Grand Theft Auto doesn't do it for you? [/h1]\n[b]Then look no further, my friend.[/b]\n\n[i]Garry's Mod is the closest you will come to having the ultimate sandbox with a vast sea of user-created content. Be it wielding light-sabers or harry potter wands and running-over anime-girls while driving a Mario kart dressed up as master-chief on a  beautiful sunny coast - Garry's mod lets you do exactly that! and even better! you can do it with your friends (or strangers)!\n\nAside from that - you can create your own scenarios, try out almost an unlimited amount of maps, be a photographer, mess with campaign of other source games, or try the scenarios shared by other users - and even experience multiple game-modes that are trending in the workshop. I can't say enough about this game, you gotta try it for yourself because the amount of content accessible by this game is endless!\n\n[b]Garry's mod[/b] showcases the pinnacle of sandbox freedom utilizing the source engine and its capabilities with the support of tons of modders and its beautiful community.\n\nHeck, even you (If you have the coding skills) can create any sort of mod you want. Want to make a drive-able ceramic toilet with nyan-cat thrusters? Go for it. Or, erm, just request for it from one of the notorious modders that work hard to keep this game fresh.[/i]\n\nThough it is worth mentioning that the content racks up the game's size (duh!), so if you're if you're having space issues you might need to tone down the mod subscription rate. Garry's mod can be played offline, but it requires a preferably good internet to download the surplus amount of contents you'll most likely subscribe to.\n[i][And uh, data-capped internet users; this game can go from being 15gb to 50gb+ depending on the content you download! so watch out.][/i]\n\nMy verdict:\nThis game is a must have for sandbox lovers who just want's to f*** around (The experience may vary) - and I have to mention that there's always something new to do, so either get it on full price or on sale; it's worth your money regardless.

Is only a \"social simulator\" with roleplaying, its like a giant playground for people to become a character they want to be (like kids). I was something big, i've seen a lot of amazing content, like doom weapons, impressive gamemodes (cinema for me is boring but i need to say is really awesome the feeling you get when you're on a good map/server) great quality playermodels and vehicles and really big BIG maps. \n\nBut i came from sven coop and all i wanted from this game was the ability to play source campaigns with those fancy weapons taken from the workshop with a online server. Cooperative games is what i like but due to every toxic player i found, a limitation of players interested in coop maps and the fact that this game is meant to be whatever you like pushed me away, even if i really enjoyed those lovely weapons and models.\n\nnote: everytime i asked people to tell me \"what im supposed to do on garry's mod\" they never answer and use admin abuse to ban me for no reason so i'll answer you that for free. Garry's mod is game focused on whatever you want to do, can be a jorney to the fallout world (rp or roleplaying), a hide and seek game, a pretty boring pvp game (sandbox with friendly fire activated), a small trip to a local cinema to watch a internet video with people you don't know like in real life or a pink texture glitch fest due to your incompetence to have money and own every source game that some maps created by the community requires you to have, just to fail even if you got anything required.\n\n I hate the game, seriously i hate it for wasting my time and my money but i don't blame anyone if they love it or hate it like me. all im going to do is uninstalling it and search for another game that i can enjoy and forget my encounter with this one.

Those two things being, Trouble in Terrorist Town, and RP servers.\n\nI don't have much beef with TTT, but at most it's only enjoyable for me if I play with a LOT of friends. Otherwise, playing with random people is like contracting the Black Death; I get infested and slowly corrode over the course of several hours.\n\nAnd then oh boy, here comes the RP servers. Specifically, I'm talking Dark RP and Star Wars TCW RP. Both of which make me want to kill myself in a multitude of ways. Most Dark RP servers, in a nutshell, are out for your blood. And I don't mean your character's blood, I mean your actual honest to God real human blood. You can get banned in so many ways on Dark RP it's unreal, and it's entirely dependent on the server you join. Some servers uphold NLR, some don't, some encourage RDM if it is in RP, others ban you if you so much as fire a single shot at a billboard as a joke, it's impossible to keep track of it all. And the quality of all these RP servers, from Dark RP to Star Wars, to Fallout or whatever the hell RP is going on, ranges from okay to questionable at best. From the management and admin staff, to the dev teams, to the type of people who actually play on the server, it all varies from server to server, and you have NO clue what kind of server you've got on your hands until you join and play on it for 15 minutes.\n\nAnd Jesus Christ, how many times do I have to do the Clone Trooper basic training. How many times do I have to do the fucking pointless faces (which are brought up during training and then never used in any practical RP situation ever again, except maybe front face). How many times do I have to get a gun and shoot targets to prove I know how to use a mouse, and to not accidentally shoot my team mates when they're running by me. You wanna know the worst part of Star Wars RP? It's the events. And just like the servers, they are of questionable and wildly ranging in terms of quality. You might have the best event ever, but does it matter what you or anyone else did? No, more than likely, it was a one-shot event, and everything that happened in it narrative-wise will never be brought up again. And once the event is over, guess what you'll be doing? You'll be on the base, or the ship, or whatever hell hole the server has decided would be the \"main map\", and you'll be sitting around doing nothing for upwards of 5 to 6 hours waiting for the next questionably designed event to take place. And once the map swaps, you're sitting around in a line with 40-50 other players waiting for the admins to finish setting up for another hour at some points, when you realize what took them so long was just simply spawning NPCs on the absolute freakishly large maps they decide to use (which tend to horribly lag no matter what kind of behemoth of a PC you have).\n\nSo yeah, basically my hatred, unenjoyment and disappointment towards Gmod isn't really necessarily Gmod itself, it's what the current player base has to offer in terms of Gamemodes and enjoyment. Fuck RP servers, honestly man. They're such a time sink of doing basically nothing. If I knew how to code I could probably modify the source engine and make my own shit, but I lack the time and the talent to put forth effort into doing so.\n\nYou ever heard of a little game mode called Morbus?

As the description says, they give you the tools and let you play.\n - Multiple gamemodes from where you can choose (both official AND community-made) , Sandbox being pretty much the most used one, if you prefer to make structures out of simple objects, making game-related posters or pretty much just starting NPC Wars; Trouble In Terrorist Town, where you need to find out who the traitor is within your team to take them down before they kill all of you (Or use your deception skills as said traitor to take down the team); Zombie Survival (Random player is spawned as a zombie; you die, you become a zombie, until all survivors die); Roleplay (pretty self-explanatory) and many, many more.\n - Low price\n - If you're planning to start making posters, Gmod is a bit more user-friendly than SFM in some aspects. \n - A very extense workshop, where you'll find things like saves, dupes (duplications of a certain construction/model) or models from different games.\n\nCons\n - If you're planning to use it to make posters, i'd recommend you check SFM first, as it is (although less user-friendly) a far more advanced program, and it's free. \n - ''You need Counter Strike : Source or you will have missing textures'' (In a nutshell, you need some other games installed in your PC for some map textures and models to appear.)\n - Most of the workshop is either filled with saves or dupes of poor quality. It's also behind SFM's workshop due to the latter being used more often for posters/animations.\n\nIn Conclusion: \n - Looking for a game? Now you have one. (But you will need a few others if you want to play in certain maps)\n - Looking for something to start an animation/posting career with? Now you have the tools.

I joined a community that was filled with a whole bunch of fantastic people! Yea there were some people who were rude and mean, but others were caring and nice. During that year, I eventually met people who would soon become my friends. That made Gmod worth playing and so I put 2 summers into it. \n\nI would defenitely recommend this game to people because of how much fun it is.

I joined, picked the dog job the server had, walked up behind someone, and said as loudly as I could \"OMAE WA MO SHINDERU\" and started attacking him. This turned into 10 minutes of role-playing as a edgy anime character, ending with a final duel between me and the guy I tried to kill.

It's not meant to be taken seriously. I mean, look at the store pictures for it. Doesn't it just shout \"serious military roleplay\"? When you take garry's mod, and try to bring seriousness to it, it's hard. Take the MilitaryRp server, for example. Why did I even need to be trained? I've played those servers before, and they ALL make you go through training. All they teach you are meaningless boring stuff, like ranks, faces, and other things that you probably never use.\n\nWhen you try to make this game a slog of rules, it just ruins it. \n\nThis game shines when silly stuff happens, and is encouraged.

It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...\n\n_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.\n\n_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.\n\n_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.\n\n_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.\n\n_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.\n\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nStory: N/A\nSound: 8/10\nReplayability: 10/10\n\nOverall 8.5\n\nEven though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy...

Try to survive as long as you can, or kill the murderer to win.), Zombie Survival (One person is a zombie, and they must infect other people, and it goes until time runs out or everyone is a zombie. Basically like infection tag. Sometimes Zombie Survival is also a whole bunch of players teaming up against computer controlled zombies as well.), Prop Hunt (A few seekers are chosen, and the rest of the players are disguised as props and must find strategic places to hide in order to avoid being caught. Seekers win by finding all props, Props win by successfully staying hidden until time runs out.), and many other epic minigames. Not to mention, this game is really good for creating animations and learning anatomy of the body.

There is many game modes you can play in and discover all kinds of ways to have fun. Sandbox was the first game mode I ever played in. Sandbox may be the most amazing game mode because you get to download pretty much anything like weapons, props, player models, places/maps other game modes exc. Anything you can think of you can get in the game and spawn it to create anything you want. You can create scenes with characters and objects and have them do anything. You can creat worlds too. You can be anything in the game as far as any character you can think of even objects. You can spawn good guys bad guys and have them fight including you. You can prank, be funny, joke and fool around, roll play or even vs each other. You can even come up with your own ideas to play sandbox. For example two of my friends and I were in sandbox and two of us were giants and one of us was tiny, so we had to find the tiny guy and kill him in order to win, so that's a idea to come up with to have fun. Like I said use your imagination and come up with all kinds of ideas to have fun with and I do repeat you can do anything in sandbox which sums up this whole review. One more thing. Garry's Mod Murder game mode is my favorite because it's basic and easy. All I got to say is some has gun some has knife some has nothing. All u gotta do is survive. If ur the murder kill everyone, if u have the gun kill the murders and if you have nothing u can get 5 props to get a gun or pick up a gun if somebody with it dies or u can simply explore or just escape the murders. Murder is interesting because you don't know who the killers are till you see them or if you see them and same with the players with the gun you just don't know what to expect or what the outcome will be when the round is over.The most I like about Garry's Mod is all the kinds of people you can meet and become friends with. We can all have great amazing times together and learn from each other.

It's a sandbox game and has so many things to offer.\n\n--Graphics--\nThe graphics are actually pretty good for a game made on a relatively old engine. It really depends on your graphical settings, though. Also due to the graphics being pretty scalable, most machines will be able to run this game and most other games running the Source Engine, though, this will depend on your setup.\n\n--Audio--\nI'm really not sure how I am supposed to answer this. It's good but depends on the makers of the mods and maps that include those sounds. Out of the box the sounds are good.\n\n--Audience--\nThis really depends on what you want to do on Garry's Mod. I reckon this targets children, teens and adults. As for gamers, this would target beginners, casuals and normal gamers.\n\n--Difficulty--\nThis game is very easy to learn. There is no in-game tutorial, that I know of. The controls are pretty simple, though, for some they may need some tuning so they fit personal preference.\n\n--Bugs--\nThere are quite a few but most of those are minor bugs that won't bother you unless in certain conditions. There are engine based bugs which probably won't be fixed, however, out of the box Garry's Mod does not really have any proper annoying bugs, as far as I know.\n\n--Story-- \nThere is no story for this game\n\n--Singleplayer--\nIt is still fun to play even on your own, however, without mods the game does get boring incredibly quickly. With mods singleplayer can be really fun. You could build machines, bases, vehicles and even more out of the box. You can build a fortress and then have NPCs invade it. You can pretty much do whatever you want to do.\n\n--Multiplayer--\nThe multiplayer experience is the same in what you can do in singleplayer except there is much more to do and you can experience it with your friends. You could build a base and try to prevent other people from invading, you could build a vehicle and race with it. There are plenty of things to choose from. There is a load of game modes to play, such as TTT, Murder, DarkRP and countless more.\n\n--Gameplay--\nThe gameplay, in general, is very enjoyable and, again, there is a plenty to do. The gunplay is smooth, the movement is smooth, most of the time. Both of those things can be improved with Add-ons.\n\n--Modding--\nThe modding community for this game is huge, there are thousands and thousands of mods to choose from each of them adding to the game in small or big ways, from being able to have a fully working Tardis to simply having realistic weather systems, it all depends on what the player wants to mod.\n\n--Conclusion--\nThis game is an incredibly well-rounded experience. It has good replayability. It is certainly fun to play. You get all of the above and more for only \u00a36.99, $9.99 or 9,99\u20ac. That is not a bad price.

We will eventually all be plugged into a machine, like in the movie, \"The Matrix\", where this beautiful masterpiece will be our life. Every day, we will wake up in heaven.

Garrys Mod is an amazing game with a good amount of gamemodes and lovely servers. You may want to play Sandbox and smack around batman or play TTT and rage because you were rdmed.\n\n[h1] Gameplay \t[/h1]  \n\nGarrys mod does not have a specific type of gameplay ranging from Prop Hunt to Stop It Slender. However your gameplay can be significantly improved by using the steam workshop and adding items.\n\n[h1] Mods \t[/h1]\n\nGarrys mod is a game focused upon the premise of random and fun addons. I personally enjoy being a watermelon and firing pizzas from a bazooka. Garrys mod has an amazing amount of mods including characters and items. This is a game focused around its modding community.\n\n[h1] TTT (Trouble In Terrorist Town)\t[/h1]\n\nTTT is the most famous gamemode in Garrys Mod. The premise of the game is simple. At the begining you are assigned a role, you are either an innocent bystander, a detective, or a traitor. However do not worry if you are innocent for this is trouble in terrorist town meaning everybody had guns. The innocent and the detectives try to find out who the traitors are while the traitors try to kill them all off. The gamemode is fun and server usually will have cool player models or gun. The main downside with TTT is rdmer's. RDM stand for Random Death Match and an rdmer is someone who out of the blue will try to kill you. This means an inno/detective randomly kills an inno/detective or a traitor kills an traitor or an inno just randomly kills someone who is a T. This really spoil's the gamemode making it unenjoyable at times but usually admins or mods will be on to help you or they will have an option to directly report it to kick/ban the person. \n\n[h1] Sandbox \t[/h1]\n\nSandbox is where creativity and stupidity flourish. Sandbox is where you can get all your downloaded mods and just have fun. Sandbox is just fooling around and having fun. It is one of Garrys Mod most hilarious game modes (if you play with the right people).\n\n[h1] Singleplayer/Muliplayer\t[/h1]\n\nSo if your planning on playing Sandbox I would recommend playing singleplayer or creating a hamachi or another program to play with a select group of friends,\n\nIf you plan to play other gamemodes I suggest playing multiplayer and trying to find a nice server which you can enjoy.\n\n[h1] Rating\t[/h1]\n\n[b] Pros\t[/b]\n+ fun alone or with friends\n+ many gamemodes to enjoy\n+ massive amount of creative and fun mods\n+ overall great community\n+ highly enjoyable \n\n[b] Cons\t[/b]\n- rdmers\n- will end up overloading computer with mods\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts\t[/h1]\n\nGarrys Mod is a must buy with its countless possibilities. It may take you a while to find a nice server or the gamemode that is for you but when you find it good times will be waiting.

If a traitor is found out, all players may call a \"KOS\" on that person. They have a bar they can open up by pressing \"B\" which allows them to buy special Traitor weapons using \"Traitor points\" they earn by killing people. If a traitor is killed and still has traitor points on them, another traitor, or detective, may come along and take those points, helping them along the way. If a Traitor is found using a weapon only Traitors can use, they would get killed, unless they get killed themselves. Traitors also have a special chat where they can discuss things that they could do to win over the game.\n\nInnocents are completely useless unless they know who is a Traitor, or have made it into the Traitor room by mistake. They must walk around like dorks and be cautious of everyone and everybody except the Detective, who they will then follow for the next ten minutes trying to survive with. They do not have a special chat and do not have a special bar to talk to Innocents to, because they don't know who is an Innocent themselves.\n\nDetectives have amazing abilities, depending on what the server allows. They can scan bodies and collect data on people who have recently killed them using the DNA. They also have their own bar to buy special weapons. Innocents will often follow them, but the Detectives could think of them as Traitors trying to knife them or shoot them quickly to death.\n\n\nProp Hunt\n\n\nProp Hunt is perhaps the funniest gamemode out there in my opinion. The game itself is pretty intense as a prop and if you're trying to find the props, then good luck.\n\nProps:\n\nBeing a prop in Prop Hunt means you need to turn into something either out in the open and not look suspicious at all, or something really really small behind the bathroom stall, like a can or a doll. When you start out, you need to find a good hiding spot, all while not knocking over props, giving away your position.\n\nHunters:\n\nBeing a hunter and trying to find some fucking veteran prop is pretty hard. Most people as props would hide as a doll or can and hide in a bush until somebody sees their red name and nuke them. Hunters are the people who, obviously, hunt the props down and kill them with unique weapons and possibly PTW donator weapons.\n\nHide and Seek: \n\nHide and Seek is a pretty fun gamemode if you have mates to play with, that actually enjoy the gameplay. Hiding in a plant as a small character or crouching behind walls are the most fun in my opinion, especially when you can taunt your friends by dancing while everybody is spectating you and theres one hunter looking around going, \"WHAT THE FUCK? WHERE IS HE?\" and everyone's just laughing. It's a fun gamemode, but you can only get so much enjoyment out of it. You start as a hunter or a hider and you need to either hunt the hider down or hide from the seeker using special abilities that may have been given to you, like the Decoy, Sudoku or Energy Bomb, for example.\n\nSandbox:\n\nAah, classic Sandbox. Not a worry in the world. You can spawn in your world, throw a nuke down and enjoy the nice weather. You can spawn NPCs to kill you, build a house, work with some mechanical shit, kill your mates in the wild on a singleplayer world, make your own RP, write a review while listening to the music you just downloaded as an addon, or just fuck around in general. Sandbox is probably the most chill and lay back mode that stands out from the rest as it gives the player some imagination and freedom, unlike the others where you have to RP as a: Pirate, Slave, Police Officer, Medieval Knight, Star Wars Clone, Jedi, Drug Addict, Child, Woody, Chuck Norris, BooBoo Fett (I'm Boba's Cousin!), Shrek, Shrek 2, Shrek the Musical, Cohtch Taylor, Skim Dilk, Melba Toast, B00B-5, Macaroni Fuckclub?, Volvar Smeggum, Pikachu, FLOOOOPS, Vimpy Fanto and finally, Darth Vader. Darth Vader. Are you shitting me? Your name is actually DARTH. FUCKING. VADER!?\n\nDark RP:\n\nI left this one for the last because people would probably most likely want to see my thoughts on this one most of all. Dark RP is a roleplaying type system, which is the most popular gamemode on Garrys Mod, in which you must either sell drugs, fight crime, help the crime, sell guns, drive cars, fuck with the admins, or just have a fun time with the mates you'll be friends with until you die in game.
