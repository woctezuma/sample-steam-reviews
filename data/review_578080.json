For a game that was in beta, bugs were definitely expected and understandable. It was a fun experience with some nice tweaks and changes from its other battle royale predecessors. I've given this game a ton of chances but Bluehole continues to destroy their own community with bad game play mechanics and poorly planned \"Season Pass\" missions that, once you've paid 13$ to get the pass, give you absolutely nothing unless you play the game non-stop, 24/7, for a month or two or be forced to buy level up packs to unlock the items you thought you just bought with the \"Season Pass\". The absolute shadiest scam I have seen in the gaming industry in a long time. I have no problem with having to work for my items, but level 70+ is next to unobtainable without purchasing extra levels and of course those are the only skins that are worthwhile. While I'm on the topic of \"Season Pass\" missions, who thought it would be a good idea to make a mission to drive a Mirado for 2 hours? On a map that you can literally wait 20 minutes in queue (both squad and duo queues) and still not get a Miramar game on NA servers. Not only that but when you do get a squad game on Miramar with any random people in the group, that random person is guaranteed to be driving around the outside of the map in his Mirado making it a 3 on 4 for the rest of the game. Great way to support team play and meet new people in the community /eyeroll.\n\nBluehole has improved very few of it's major glaring flaws since it's beta but you can be sure it'll keep on updating those textures as well as those $5USD/ea character skins. The enemy hit-boxes are a complete joke and don't reflect where the characters actually are on your screen because the servers are just sad for a 40$ game with a boatload of in-game purchases. If you play on NA servers, Bluehole likes to schedule their updates between 6:30pm to 1:00 or 2:00am EST most nights. If any sort of update is launched (even a 20 Mb anti cheat update), be prepared for about 3 hours of \"SERVERS ARE BUSY\" messages if you try to log in. I guess even with all that money they still haven't been able to figure out how to properly launch an update from a second server that doesn't knock out the dedicated game servers or purchase proper bandwidth for their game.\n\nWith a game like Apex Legend that just came out for free, where you can REALISTICALLY grind upgrades, skins and character unlocks without even having to pay a penny, I give this game less that a year before its dead in the water and you can't find a match even if you wanted to. Not to mention the game play is cleaner and more fluid on Apex.\n\nI can't wait to watch this company self destruct for the complete disconnect that Bluehole has with its community.", "timestamp_created": 1549836280, "timestamp_updated": 1549836280, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 121, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.815069615840911865", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49160095": {"recommendationid": "49160095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108845088", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 12826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "last_played": 1550859763}, "language": "english", "review": ">have 40 million  players\n>get money approx 30 \u20ac per player\n>get approx 1200000000 \u20ac\n>have 2 year time to fix pubg\n>adds 3 maps and new dropping system and bad guns", "timestamp_created": 1550860109, "timestamp_updated": 1551217762, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 177, "votes_funny": 33, "weighted_vote_score": "0.784771919250488281", "comment_count": 34, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48852927": {"recommendationid": "48852927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080254195", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514080666}, "language": "english", "review": "Crappy Game didn't deserve that Steam Award.", "timestamp_created": 1549650468, "timestamp_updated": 1549650468, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 864, "votes_funny": 88, "weighted_vote_score": "0.737689673900604248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48793421": {"recommendationid": "48793421", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979465809", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 65104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550182200}, "language": "english", "review": "Loot for 20 minutes.

Wrong! The mobile version is way more fun (better menu system and more intuitive controls) but more importantly, runs much better. The PC Steam version is sooo glitchy. Most times I end up stuck in the air floating on a parachute and not able to even land on the ground. I have a few clips of this.\n\nAlso, you need a top spec PC to really run this game. In my opinion, the minimum specified 8GB is not enough. Also, you will need a super fast internet connection or there really is no point buying this game! My internet connection is pretty decent but was getting a lot of lag anyway.\n\nGoing back to the mobile version, you can use settings to automatically pick up a specified amount of items. So for example, you can set it so that you pick up 250 rounds of a specified type of ammo. All you do is run/walk over the ammo and you automatically pick it up. Once you get to the specified number, you wont pick up any more. You can do this with med kits, cans etc. In this version, you have to individually point to and pick up items (by pressing a button). This makes game play really tedious and takes away the fun. Developers! \n\nAnother point - in the mobile version you get little footprints appearing on the map when you hear an enemy approaching. This is useful as you can home in on direction easily, making game play more fluid. Your team mates' footsteps will not appear on the map in this way. Also useful. In the Steam version there is no way to tell which audible footsteps are whose meaning you have to focus a lot more. I think this makes it less fun. Leave all that tactical stuff to Tom Clancy. The same applies to gunshots, in the mobile version your enemy's gunshots are marked on the map, giving you a rough direction (unless they are using a supressor). Developers!\n\nOne more thing - you will get head shot ed through a wall by someone using botware (cheating!). I think they are now trying to clamp down on cheats but there are still loads for sure! This does not really bother me that much. What does bother me is the numerous glitches and tedious game play!\n\nAs other people have said, this has a lot of potential.

From rubberbanding to full out disconnection, you would believe it if someone said they were using 56k to play.\n\nNow, this boils the game down to usually one of two experiences overall. The game works, you play it regularly, and it provides as much joy as the amount of effort you put into it.\n\nOr you get 1/10 games where your death didn't feel like it was based on technical issues.\n\nPopular players generally sit on the luck side of gameplay,. However, if you watch a PUBG streamer for long, even they fall prey to this poorly optimized game.\n\nIt's truly a sad thing as well. This concept for a game is magnificent. Truly, there has been nothing like it before. Had the developers stayed the course, and not let the dollar signs misdirect them, this would be a game hailed as the next genre of FPS gaming. Instead what you get is an upset and toxic community, hit or miss copycats, and ridiculous moments like the pan lawsuit.\n\nPUBG should've been a step forward for the next generation.

The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through. \n \nI've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated.

What started out as a promising game has degraded and fallen into increasing irrelevance. The game is plagued by huge amounts of downtime, lacklustre and unrewarding combat, and a punishing gear treadmill. What further ruins the experience are the aforementioned performance issues and rampant cheaters. Developer negligence to any of these issues has left the game stagnant, and superseded by games like CS:GO and Apex Legends. \n\nFirst and foremost the game is boring. One key issue that plagues PUBG is how huge the maps are, and how this creates a reliance on vehicles as there are no other transportation methods. In the standard 4 player mode it's common to find that you're unable to locate a vehicle that can transport all 4 players on your team, meaning 2 of you need to hoof it unless you can find a 2nd vehicle. 2-player vehicles just shouldn't be in the game, it adds to the huge amount of content-devoid downtime there is. \n\n_It is a very real possibility that you will never find a vehicle and you will be forced to sprint across huge open distances, in which nothing will happen._\n\nWhen you're not looting, you're running or driving. It takes too long to get to a state where you're decently equipped. Equipment is _the_ ultimate decider in a firefight, not skill. A minimal amount of time per match is actually spent in combat with other players. Depending on luck, you might go through the majority of the match without firing a single shot, because you picked somewhere to go where the other players happened to ignore. This happens because, again, the maps are too large.\n\nThe developers are greedy and lazy, and unworthy of your support. Bluehole have the temerity to add loot boxes to an unfinished early access title. There are technical issues still prevalent in the game since PUBG appeared on Steam.

So enjoy it!!!\n\nLatest highlights for bug lovers:\n- Weekly 4 hours to 7 hours maintenance to add more bugs\n- Updates every week to add more bugs, FPS, ping, cheaters, so you have a blast.\n- Vikendi, a map where the player with less FPS wins, but if you're one of the lucky ones that gets stuck under the stairs you can win it all!! :D\n- New unbalanced gaming so you can s... even the PROs!\n- New cheaters! The only reason they are banning people is because cheaters will probably PAY AGAIN!\n\nNow, if you don't like bugs, you like quality and great games, just move forward, I can tell you this game isn't for you, I thought it was for me, but with time I loose hope on seeing any improvement.

I have pretty good PC setup with 2x 3.6 ghz Xeon (8 cores totally 16 threads) + 1080Ti and 48GB of RAM, but the performance pain on low graphic settings has never gone and after some updates it was even worse. Instead of fixing performance problems, Bluehole decided to put new Battle Passes millions of skins and MEGA LAGY WINTER MAP + other shit. To understand my case - with my setup in average I was getting around 55-65 FPS in this game and it never get better even after million forum threads and hundreds youtube videos about how to optimize the PC to get better performance - Bluehole WTF is this??? So to play your game without insane frame drops (20-25 FPS) in beginning action (Pochinki), I have to upgrade my gear putting in more hundreds $$$ and feel happy finally??? No! I'm done with this sh*t, to be honest. I don't think there is another game on youtube, that has such amounts of optimization guide videos like PUBG has. I'm just tiered and done with this game...

If you engage you die.Sometimes about every few months you can clock up a win but it is very difficult as the last 10 in each game are hacks against hacks. Most are impatient and young so you strike for the first time when its the last 4 or three, use grenades and monotov. Remember they can press a button and the aimbot they have will go straight to your head, so knocking them is the key to winning before their aimbot kills you. They can also see you at all times. They even have flying cars and god and demigod.\nPubg are powerless to stop them.\nWhat pubg should do is to give us 1 hack free map. Nobody cares about having several maps or competitions, just give us 1 hack free map. \nI have played this game in xbox which although not hack free, it is mainly hack free and the game is brilliant.

Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?\n\n[b] Mistakes / poor decisions: [/b]\n\n- First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.\n\n- Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.\n\n- No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or \"xenophobic\" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.\n\n- Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).\n\n- Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.\n\n- STEREO sound... what year is this??\n\n- Some \"minor\" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.\n\n[b] What would make this game better? [/b]\n\n- Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.\n\n- Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).\n\n- Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.\n\n- Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.\n\nIf they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.\n\n- Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!\n\n- Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue. \n\n- Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.\n\nIf they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.\n\n[b] Why is it so popular then? [/b]\n\nIt's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.\n\nAll of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.\n\nThe most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.\n\nThere are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say \"China numba wun\".\n\nGreed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.\n\n[b] Edited to add: [/b] To those that say \"engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite\", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.\n\nPUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game. \n\nFortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could \"easily handle 100 players\" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.\n\nRecent tests: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiYX9ik0iec \nNetcode 101: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiHP0N-jMx8", "timestamp_created": 1518053431, "timestamp_updated": 1520708261, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4400, "votes_funny": 201, "weighted_vote_score": "0.913685917854309082", "comment_count": 228, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42361706": {"recommendationid": "42361706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053268485", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 24158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546107971}, "language": "english", "review": "I've encountered this game just like 99,9% of it's player-base did, by watching Twitch streams and youtube videos.\nBeing something relatively new in the multiplayer scene (THAT ACTUALLY HAD A MASSIVE PLAYER-BASE), I managed to talk few of my friends into playing it.\n\nI'm not going to lie, we've spent hundreds of hours on it.\n\nThat was until the official release of 1.0\nKeep in mind that we're talking about previously most played game in the world at some point, a game which brought it's developers millions (if not 10 digit numbers), and as any sane person, you'd expect that it will be poured into further development and fixes, right?\n\nLOL wrong. We're talking about Bluehole here.\n\nYou really have to be next level special in order to stumble upon a gold mine, and then proceed to blow it up and cave it in. They had everything, massive FREE ADVERTISEMENT (NOTE: FREE > NOT REQUIRED TO PAY FOR) in a form of Twitch streamers and YouTube content creators, insane ACTIVE player-base, a product that's close to being 1.0 ready... Everything.\nThey got money, they got everything. And what do they do?:\n \nIn game purchases.\n\nIt's disgusting seeing that someone who had all the foundation required to make a masterpiece ignore all that and just attempts to drain more money from players.\nThey rushed the 1.0 to be able to implement in-game purchases, and instead of actually WORKING on it, what do they do? More platforms.\nNot only that none of the platforms performed remotely well, they completely ignored that fact and started working on more crates and more in-game purchases.\n\nSince I could go about this all day long, and considering I'm actually rating a game here and not it's thirsty developer, I'll focus on it now:\n\nPros:\n- Fast queue times due to high player-base,\n- SOLID graphics.\n- Good ballistics (Sniper and AR bullet drop)\n\n\nCons:\n- Fully released game some of the problems that should have been fixed before the release.\n\nEDIT:\n- PLENTY OF CHEATERS. Even though the developers started to take action against hackers now that the game has headed to ruin, there are still PLENTY of non-conventional cheaters such as VPN abusers (lifting ping on purpose to abuse the poor netcode and hit detection) and Macro users (Auto-aim/Recoil control). Even though the numbers have dropped, this is still heavily affecting the game and user experience.\n\n- Countless game breaking bugs (getting killed by nothing when vaulting, getting stuck in thin air while landing resulting in getting killed, reloading sometimes doesn't reload your weapon at all resulting in getting killed...)\n\n- HORRIBLE performance issues (High end PC users can be happy if they hit constant 60fps on medium-high settings at all times)\n\n- Hilarous netcode. So many instances when you get killed by someone who didn't even have a line of sight, constant stuttering, 60%+ fail rate of reconnecting to the game in case of a disconnect.\n\n- Horrible bullet detection system (this one mostly affects Shotguns)\n\n- Retarded level design. This one is a great issue mostly focused on the Miramar map. They forced a new map which is massive in terms of size, but ironically has least content, least quality looting area, a MASSIVE LACK of vehicles considering the proportions of the map (mostly resulting in you playing a running simulator for about 20 minutes and ending up getting killed by someone who had luck with the initial safe zone). Even though the original map is better, they still need to prevent bridge camping which makes the game impossible if you had bad luck with initial looting and safe zone.\n\n- EDIT: Since one of the recent patches, my character no longer stutters while running, proving my point this was indeed caused by the game, and not by my PC or internet connection.\n\n- I will stop with Cons for now since there's only so much time I can waste on this review. But yes, there are way more.\n\n\n################\n\nBottom line, if you haven't already bought this game: DO NOT. Save your money. There are better alternatives if you're just taking up a new game, and they're even free to play. They don't have some of the mechanics PUBG has, and that's a shame, but at least they're optimized. Keep in mind that this game requires over the average PC to even be able to start the game, let alone play it properly.\n\nThis is not a dead game yet, there's still time to fix it.", "timestamp_created": 1527602660, "timestamp_updated": 1530113012, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6442, "votes_funny": 290, "weighted_vote_score": "0.928484916687011719", "comment_count": 303, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42872935": {"recommendationid": "42872935", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022113306", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 12575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 872, "last_played": 1551636628}, "language": "english", "review": "Money-making machine.

But I'm going to tell you now, once the honeymoon phase wears off, this game QUICKLY stops being fun and you'll begin to notice just how awful the quality of it is.\n\n- The netcode in this game is absolutely atrocious, and is hugely abusable for players with a high ping. The extremely low tickrate and insane desync that results from it means that you're constantly dying around corners a full second after taking cover - or worse, dumping half a magazine of full-auto assault rifle into someone as soon as they come around a corner, only to get onetapped by them mid-spray because they'd already come around the corner and shot you dead on their end two seconds ago, before you even saw them start moving on your end. No ping cap or region lock means players can queue for matches on servers halfway across the world and instantly get an insane amount of peeker's advantage.\n\n- There's a huge cheater population in the game that has been there ever since PUBG started getting popular. Aimbot, wallhacks, recoil scripts, teaming in solo matches, the list goes on. Battleeye does next to nothing to stop this.\n\n- There are still bugs galore that need to be fixed, some of which have been in the game since alpha. Randomly dying from fall damage just because you brushed up against the wrong wall/object, vehicles glitching into walls or flying into the stratosphere from the slightest collision (admittedly hilarious but still in need of fixing), hit registration being complete garbage - there's just too many to list here. \n\nBut in their infinite wisdom, Bluehole decided to let all this go through to the 1.0 release instead of actually making the game a release-ready product, likely for Christmas sales.\n\nTL;DR: Don't get this game until it's actually in a release-ready state, if it ever gets there.", "timestamp_created": 1515096194, "timestamp_updated": 1515096194, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3606, "votes_funny": 142, "weighted_vote_score": "0.892594516277313232", "comment_count": 149, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43299440": {"recommendationid": "43299440", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970406673", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 17926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547749261}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]UPDATE 3: Remember \"FIX PUBG\"?

I've been playing for well over a year, only not as frequently lately, and it is because of my last few months of experience with this game that I can no longer recommend it to people.\n\nThis game started off great. There was so much promise in its concept and execution. You could almost feel what the game should eventually be even waaaay back in its early state, back when it was so broken that a stun grenade in a busy portion of the map like School would spell disaster for several teams by promptly crashing their games with no capability to return to the match. And yet, even with absolutely infuriating scenarios like that, I am finding myself looking more fondly upon those memories than I do towards the game in its current state. And it's not from lack of improvement. Such game breaking bugs like that have been removed, and the core gameplay is leaps and bounds more smooth, intuitive, and reliable. However, there are still massive faults.\n\nI am an average player. I have won many, many chickens between solo, duos, 2-man, 3-man, and full squad. But I died/lost 4/5 games I played, a figure which has increased dramatically as of late. I haven't won a game in weeks, nay, quite possibly over a month. And it hasn't been from lack of trying, and certainly not from good teammates. Is it balance changes? It can't be. SMG's, DMR's, and the AK currently reign supreme, my favorite and most used weapons in the game. They shoot better, tighter, and more naturally. Aiming feels great. The new attachments and scopes are great. All of the map changes are great. Every improvement they have made has been great.\n\nSo what is it? What is my problem with this game?\n\nAs of 6 months ago, this game was a cesspool of Chinese cheaters, leaving most matches in a state of absolute chaos and dismay as you get to the final several people alive only to be instantly headshotted by some cuck with an aimbot that couldn't possibly have had a bead on you from 150m out with an (at the time) incredibly underpowered Vector. And while the volume of this has subsided, [i]it still fucking happens[/i]. What's worse is that it is no longer just foreign influence to blame. There are plenty of English speaking cheaters as well. And what makes matters worse is that the death cam and spectator views in the game are so broken that in many instances it's hard to tell if someone [i]isn't[/i] cheating because more often than not, the perspective you end up seeing shows wild shots into the distance, inhuman camera snaps, and impossibly compensated recoil that leave you itching to hit that report button. Are people really this good? Was 6 months all it took for people to get [i]really, really[/i] good at this game even after it had already sold 20+ million copies? I often tend to think not, and as such, any and all suspicious deaths now get a gracious report regardless of what I see in the death cam. And honestly, [i]that's not fucking cool[/i].\n\nBut to blame cheaters for all of this games shortcomings isn't fair, because that isn't every game. Sometimes you do just get outplayed or royally screwed by RNG or core gameplay mechanics. And I think that's where the true fault is in this game. Now that a lot of bugs have been removed and the core gameplay has been overall tightened, it's beginning to show that the base game is just...not that good. Yes, weapons are balanced, movement and interaction are much better than they used to be (though sometimes still infuriatingly clunky and unresponsive at the beginning of the game), but to call the game itself balanced is rubbish. Either you get lucky and nobody drops near you, giving you a chance to actually find gear, or you don't and you die instantly, leaving your team at a disadvantage and more often than not resulting in an immediate return to the lobby as no single member of the party wants to spectate for the next 20 minutes. This simple aspect of the game is both rewarding when you make it through, and anger inducing when you don't, cursing RNGesus to hell as you slam your left mouse button with so much hatred over that \"Exit to Lobby\" UI element.\n\nBut that is only one source of frustration. The other is how the game handles characters being behind cover. This is I think the most important complaint any player could make about this game. I have in the several hundred gigs of replays and game captures so many instances of deaths where I am shot by someone hiding behind a tree or rock or building, where only the teeniest, tiniest part of their head is exposed from the cover, yet somehow according to the game mechanics, their gun is also able to fire around that cover and complete a shot. Yet it seems when I try to do this same action, I feel completely exposed. No matter how much I lean into and creep around a corner, it's as though my entire body is exposed, and I am more often than not targeted and shot within milliseconds of bringing my gun up to aim and tapping the peek controls. For a game that while obviously isn't rooted purely in realism but still tries its hardest to bring a sense of reality into player interaction, instances like this absolutely confuse me.\n\nAnother current aggrivation includes hit detection and the application of armor values. I played a game a couple nights ago where a player in a ghillie suit was creeping his way into the circle while my squadmates and I began popping shots at him. I hit him 3 solid times with a Mini 14 from ~ 150m out. Blood on each shot, absolutely unmistakable hits right to center mass. Another teammate scored another 2 shots on him with a SCAR-L, and another teammate with an SKS delivered the killing blow with 2 well placed headshots. Upon making my way over to him, I noticed something incredibly strange. His body contained a fresh, untouched and undamaged level 3 helmet, as well as a level 3 vest that still had a whopping 173 armor value left on it. We even compared game replay footage afterwards to confirm our blood splatters, all of which according to our games showed a total of 7 confirmed hits with fully outfitted, high damage weapons. How is this possible? What about the headshots that killed him, that actually confirmed in the kill feed that he was killed with a HEADSHOT? How does this translate to no damage being taken to the level 3 helmet?\n\nThis is not the first instance of this I have seen either. Since the latest balance changes, body armor appears to have become...broken. At times, you'll feel as though your level 3 vest does absolutely nothing when you get hit in the chest from 300m away with an M24 and your vest is destroyed in a single hit. And yet other times you'll find yourself hitting someone repeatedly with a similar sniper/DMR, only to see that shiny glint of a green level 1 helmet or the washed out blue of the level 1 police vest still intact and on their body.\n\nI'd like to believe I'm just crazy. I'd like to believe I just suck. But then I play a game or two where things just work out and I wipe a team, maybe even two by myself. And while I would love for those moments to redeem this game, to make me go \"Wow that was so worth the pain and anguish of the last 11 games filled with absolute bullshit\", it isn't. Not anymore. Because even those games were you find yourself wiping squad after squad, you still get to the final couple circles only to be met with a fate that often feels engineered to put you at odds with someone who just happened to get lucky in one way or another. It is this inconsistency that makes this game feel like a waste of time.\n\nWinning is no longer a reward of skill, it's a byproduct of luck and inconsistent game mechanics. More often than not, you'll find yourself feeling like you've simply wasted your time playing this.

I don't watch or follow streamers and can't see the point in doing that instead of actually playing the game. This is a matter of principle - if you'the consequences of doing that. And while the streamers get pampered, cheating is completely out of control.\n\nWhat worries me the most is that Brendan Greene (aka PLAYERUNKNOWN) seems to be a fan of Microsoft and their \"software as a service\" business model, which already spawned abominations like [b][u][url=https://www.grc.com/never10.htm]Cancer 10[/url][/u][/b]. Thus the lack of plans for Linux and Mac OS X ports and for Vulkan support. I'm pretty sure they have DirectX 12 support planned though and eventually the game might become [b][u][url=https://www.grc.com/never10.htm]Cancer 10[/url][/u][/b] only, which would be a real shame.\n\n[b]UPDATE 1:[/b] with the 14 September 2017 update, the devs decided to go all Microsoft and removed some of the players' choices. The Shadows setting is now being ignored, and a high level of shadows is being forced on all players, together with ambient occlusion, bloom and depth of field. All the bugs reported on [b][u][url=https://forums.playbattlegrounds.com/topic/66841-test-server-known-issues-read-first]the game's official forums[/url][/u][/b] by people who played on the test servers before the update was deployed to the main servers were solemnly ignored, making me wonder what's the point in having test servers at all.\n\n[b]UPDATE 2:[/b] one of their \"community managers\" posted an \"explanation\" referring to [b][u][url=https://forums.playbattlegrounds.com/topic/70545-warning-bluehole-has-just-edited-their-previous-forum-statement-regarding-editing-ini-files]this topic[/url][/u][/b] on reddit instead of on their official forums where the topic was created, so I posted on their official forums that doing that was amateurish of him. A few minutes later, I was summarily banned from their official forums without any previous warning by a moderator going by the nick [b]PUBG_Caesar of Roma[/b]. And to think that I've been helping to promote this game on all the [b][u][url=http://www.noobsforever.net][>NF<] Game Servers[/url][/u][/b] sites and community channels since it was launched...\n\nSo, when you post on the PUBG official forums, be extremely careful not to write anything the hypersensitive, touchy-feely \"community managers\" and moderators might find even slightly offensive to them, or you will be banned without warning and with no chance to appeal the ban.\n\n[b]UPDATE 3:[/b] on 20 December 2017 the game officially left early access state, and I gotta give the devs some credit for having had the courage to release this... thing. They actually managed to make the game look and play and sound worse than the early access version. All textures have been downfiltered and the color palette reduced. Chromatic aberration also seems to have been applied, together with color oversaturation. I would say that, once they admitted to themselves that they were unable to increase the game's performance, they decided to partially achieve that by downgrading the quality of the graphics. And the water... what have they done to the water?!?!? Was it really their intention to make it look like an oil spillage happened?\n\nNow on to the new \"desert\" map (AKA Miramar). It's hard to find words to describe that abomination. While every spot on Erangel had some kind of \"point\" to it, with different strategies needed depending on where you decided to land, the new map would probably have been better if they had let a program generate it by randomly placing groups of buildings and hills across the map - because that's what it is, a pointless mess of pointless spots, plagued by even worse graphics than Erangel, with horribly overbright low-quality textures covering the whole thing. \n\nAny FPS game from the mid 2000's looks and plays and sounds way better than this. I laughed a lot with my friends because some of the new vehicle sounds actually reminded us of someone having sexual intercourse. The bombing sounds are equally laughably inconsistent. I really tried hard to find some redeeming quality to this release but it's so bad and annoying in so many ways that I'm not even feeling like playing the game anymore.\n\n[b]UPDATE 4:[/b] with the release of the new crates on 22 February 2018, I decided today to check out the state the game was in. I only have one word to describe it: [b]ABOMINATION[/b]. They managed to make the graphics and the maps even uglier - even the once glorious Erangel is now hard to look at without my stomach churning. For some reason they decided to shrink the fonts and the game's items, making text harder to read and items harder to pick up. The game's items were also reskinned and look much worse now, as does most everything else. But the icing on this rotten cake is the new \"sliding feature\". It works like this: when you stop moving, you continue to slide in the direction you were moving for a while. That makes you miss turns, items and enemies all the time. The only reason I can possibly imagine for someone to play the game the way it is now is to get the crates and sell them on the community market.\n\n[b]UPDATE 5 (27 May 2018):[/b] Chinese cheat fest.", "timestamp_created": 1503768425, "timestamp_updated": 1527411262, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 524, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.810313880443572998", "comment_count": 29, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32725694": {"recommendationid": "32725694", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012128513", "num_games_owned": 661, "num_reviews": 126, "playtime_forever": 60580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549267476}, "language": "english", "review": "Realistic and fun simulation of Detroit area.", "timestamp_created": 1498309049, "timestamp_updated": 1498309049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6092, "votes_funny": 9438, "weighted_vote_score": "0.899984180927276611", "comment_count": 123, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "43489250": {"recommendationid": "43489250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055631860", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 121146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547185385}, "language": "english", "review": "2000 hours I have spent waiting and praying for the dev's to get their shit together.

We had to play SEA or AS servers to be able to actually play a game. A group of 100+ Australian and New Zealand players grouped together (from discord) and tried to join a game at the same time and they just weren't able to. OC servers were fucked! Sure we had the smallest playbase but if you looked at the PUBG sub reddit, we were by far the most vocal. It took 5 months for them to implement a new matchmaking system and all that did was screw over the other regions (NA players being forced to play on EU/AS/SEA servers and vise versa, etc.).\n\nIt's been a long time since 1.0 has been released and there's still problems after problems.

Greed and disregarding your fanbase's concerns yields a drop in customers as well as reputation. I will write an honest, unbiased review based off of my gameplay experience and thank you for taking the time to read my review. \n\n*For the sake of the review I will include the whole entity of PUBG (head company/developers/publishers) when I mention \"PUBG\"*\n\nGoing back a few years, I spent a good amount of time in DAYZ:SA. I really enjoyed the loot/survival aspect, but the game was being developed far too slowly and I was ready to move on. I hopped on the Battlegrounds train while it was in the beta stage and I was impressed. In the midst of a growing market of battle royale games I decided to give my time and money to PUBG because I anticipated a lot of great content. Normally I pray the rosary at the thought of \"early access\" games and throw holy water on pre-orders, but after reading several great reviews I wanted to see what the hype was about. From conception to release, the game seemed to grow exponentially and everything was going great. They even had 2 crates, Suvivor and Wanderer, that you didn't need a case key to open. Was this CD PROJEKT RED manifesting in a different form? Everything was going well until the introduction of paid crates. \n\nThe core things I like about PUBG at this moment in time are:\n*Diversity of weapons\n*Diversity of attachments\n*Character agility (vaulting/jumping/crouching/prone/swimming)\n*Vehicular maneuverability\n*Vehicular diversity\n*Access to every building, making it feel immersive\n\nThe core things I dislike about PUBG at this moment in time are:\n*Clientside lag\n*High ping players being grouped with low/moderate ping players\n*Paid Crates/skins\n*Bluehole trying to scrape as much money before the game capsizes\n*Useless weapons (crowbar/machete)\n\nTo me, this game feels like a cash grab. Instead of fixing their netcode, separating players based off of ping, and developing a structured game, PUBG does the opposite. It caters to a younger audience that doesn't know any better about the prinicples of gambling, attempts defaming Fortnite instead of taking some ideas and implementing them in a better way, and bases the game off of an economy. Anything that is based off of economic gain, and content not in the interest of customers, on a fundamental level WILL collapse. Once the economy runs dry, so do the developers and the trend follows all the way through to the top, whereas the opposite will happen if you keep your customers happy. What's more upsetting is the \"FIX PUBG\" button in the menu on the top right once the game loads. It is up to the developers to create, patch, and improve a game while listening to the player. Instead I get the feeling that our concerns go in one ear and out the other while continuing to release new crates/skins/clothes.\n\nDean Hall promised so many fans a working DAYZ:SA, but once he reached his financial goal, he ran and left the DAYZ:SA corpse to rot in someone else's hands.

Basically placing 100 players into 1 world and letting us killing each other to win either with a team of 4 or duo or solo. But then I just can't recommend this game because of its various problems and how the developers is treating the player base.\n\n[h1][b]First off the game itself.. Or just the whole management of the game[/b][/h1]\n\nFirst off I will not really blame them for the server issues because handling 1 million plus players does offer some challenges etc but slapping ADS into a game to buy a third party software just to \"boost\" their connectivity to their game servers is kind of fucked up seriously like wow, they too paid a premium for the game but why is it that after paying for the game they still have to get a third party software to \"boost\" their connectivity to the game servers? isn't the devs of PUBG themselves should take the responsibility and say \"Okay we need more servers for the chinese players\"? [b]Honestly I do not care about much about this whole issue because it does not affect me in any way but what if they did this to the English players or the whole player base? \" Oh hey our server can't handle the amount of people so please after buying our game please get a third party \"booster\" software to \"boost\" your connection\" Like what the actual fuck?[/b]\n\n[h1][b]The game trailer..[/b][/h1] \nLooks really good am I right? Looks very interesting, so much intense fighting and feels thrilling. Well sadly the game trailer is just full of SHIT. The trailer is what you would call glitter over a game. Those fights you seen in the trailer out of 100 games you will probably will only ever experience those fights in like 1 out of your 100 games or totally none at all. Those fight rarely occurs because RNG fucks you over or you will be running for half the game from the blue circle just to be killed be some cheater later on. To put it simply the trailer is just a cool montage to make the game look good. [i] [This is not really a problem it is more of me nitpicking at here] [/i]\n\nDO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE GAME TRAILER.\n\n[h1][b]Optimization[/b][/h1]\nIt is really bad. I can run the game smoothly at 60FPS but the rendering of textures in this game is just horrible. I won't even say much for this because it is just obvious when you play the game.\n\nIf you are wondering what I am running with for this game. It is not the best but I am pretty surely this can run it at a much better rate\n\n- Processor\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i5-7500 CPU @ 3.40GHz\n-  Video Card\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070\n - RAM\n16 GB\n - Operating System\nMicrosoft Windows 10 (build 15063), 64-bit\n\n[h1][b]The Devs going back on their word regarding microtransactions is kind of \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ed up[/b][/h1]\n\nYes I know it is only for cosmetic purposes and it will not affect the gameplay at all. [ For those people who will say \"hey but its only cosmetics\" ]\nAdding microtransactions means adding microtransactions and them going back on their word there is no other way around. It is like a lie is a lie no other way around it.\n\nSo what this means? In the future anything they promise us like lets say a free new map for example. They can easily go back on their word anytime and say that the new map they promised us to be free will be sold as a DLC :D I mean why not right? They went back on their word on microtransactions and it is so blatant, this means that the Devs dare to go back on their word without fear. Oh not to mention the game is still in EARLY ACCESS filled with a alot of bugs.\nOh yes early access with loot crates. Whats next? Needing to open lootcrates to get keys to open other lootcrates? Well if it really comes from this game I won't be surprised at all.\n\n[h1][b]And finally this takes the cake\n\nCHEATERS[/b][/h1]\nIn this game it is so hard to get first place basically winning and the cheaters is getting extremely out of hand. Aside from fighting other 95 + other players you still have to deal with cheaters!! In the early stages there weren't many cheaters but after some time they grew and there seem to be nothing has been done to put a stop to them. Right now literally every game there is usually 1 cheater lurking just having extreme speed [ The most common I see so far that is obvious ] or just \"aimbotting\". Just goto youtube and search you can see lots of them. \n\n[b]Here is an example where I encountered a cheater. [/b]\nWas in a team of 4, 1 dead and 3 was alive and 3V1. Me and 2 other friends was alive. [ Note my team was all at 80% HP ]\nI was downed by a burst fire from far range [ 4 shots from AKM downed me instantly ] But managed to get revived. I found it very suspicious but i doubted there was a cheater. People do hit lucky shots once in a while. \nBut this is where things gets very obvious. Final circle came and then the opponent just killed all 3 of us in an instant and all of us were behind cover. And game over just like that. \nYou can say oh we are just bad it is up to you to think what you want but lets be real here you will know someone is cheating when somthing so stupid happens like in my case all 3 of us dies behind cover at the same time instantly. Like if I were to die when peeking ok the opponent may be just be very skiled but no all 3 of us were behind cover.\n\nFor those who still says you have not encountered cheaters, well good for you but play the game more and you will encounter them sonner or later.\n\n[i]  Honestly I do not even know what kind of cheats that person was using but it was just plain obvious ] [/i]\n\nJust plain disappointed and disgusted at its practices in this game and how the player base is getting treated.", "timestamp_created": 1501849204, "timestamp_updated": 1508938814, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.74138253927230835", "comment_count": 27, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "44719353": {"recommendationid": "44719353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016886957", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 174001, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549576982}, "language": "english", "review": "Almost a year and the game still suffers from rampant desync and latency issues.", "timestamp_created": 1536879667, "timestamp_updated": 1536879667, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 372, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.853497147560119629", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39610028": {"recommendationid": "39610028", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963446504", "num_games_owned": 432, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 29108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1551736267}, "language": "english", "review": "Decent First Person Shooter / Third Person Shooter.\n\nCurrent problem with the game and why i can't recommend the game:\n\n- There are rubberbanding Issues which results in you not being able to pick up items you are standing op top of even if you spam the pick up item key, which can be crucial and often times outright deadly.\n\n- There are no region lock (this is a problem because the majority of the playerbase is chinese (41% of the player base) and do to an uther lack of competence from the creator of the game Brendon Green they are forced to pay a monthy fee to get access to the game or use a VPN service so they can get around that, and to try and avoide that the chinese players are joining american and european servers, which results in people with an horrible ping will be joining servers they wore never supose to be playing at in the first place (some times you can even be downed by player you have already downed yourself...)\n\n- There is a huge cheating problem in the game. (99% of all cheaters are chinese (this number is taken from the banned list, im not making it up, 99% of all cheaters are from china, so this creates a huge problem for none chinese players when chinese players play on none chinese servers. \n\n- People have been banned for the crime of shooting Twitch Streamers (doesn't matter if you have a twitch account watching the stream or not, just the act of shooting a streamer have gotten people perma banned from the game.\n\n- People have been banned for driving around the game honking the horns in the cars.\n\n- People have been banned for shoting people that join Squads as randoms who shot their team mates... ye that's right, shoting a teamkiller in selfdefence against other teamkillers have gotten people Permabanned from the game.\n\n- The Anti cheating \"service\" is more incompetent than Brendon Green.

I used to play it a lot with my friends and had some fun too. I even used to play it a lot in single player mode too when I was new and even then I liked it. But after spending 350+hours I started to get bored.If you are a person who likes to try out almost every type of game then you may enjoy it too for the first 100-200hrs with that you will also get your money's worth.\nNow if you are looking for a fair competitive game then I would say look somewhere else as this game may not be for you. Mainly because its unfair and unbalanced.\n\nIn PUBG you spend 10 minutes in looting then another 10-15 mins either camping or running from the blue circle. If you are unlucky then you will get killed\nsoon after you have finished looting by someone from a location which you may not spot easily. Otherwise jump to a crowded location and start testing your luck.\nIf you take the first approach then for most of the time you ae literally doing nothing in the game except wasting time.\nIn the second scenario you may not even get a gun by looting a 2 storey house but your opponent will get it within few seconds inside a small house and will kill you with it.\nIn both scenario's you will either get frustrated and angry or satisfied momentarily (if you managed to kill someone).The game only becomes intense during the last 5 mins.\nLoots are generally medical supplies to boost your health and gun attachments to increase the shot's accuracy.\n\nThese things may be fun for some people but not for me. But these are not the only reasons I left playing this game the main reasons are these :\n1. BUGS. There are a lot of bugs in this game. Lot means a lot.Everyday people are discovering something new. You can headover to reddit to\nknow more about them. Due to these you may loose an easy win situation. I think many people including me have experienced this many times.\n2.Server desync & bad ping are the biggest nonsense in this game.eg: I hit a guy many times but he didn't go down instead he kills me easily with max 2 shots? When I check the \nreplay it shows that I only hit him once or twice.\n3.Cheaters. Now they are very less compared to last few months. However you may come across 1 or 2 in a day compared to 1 in almost every match previously.(I have upoaded some videos\nexposing some cheaters you can view them from my profile)\n\nHowever bluehole has not solved some of the old bug issues yet (the parachute opening, item visibility while landing etc). Instead they are focussing on something else.\nBattleroyale genre is like a fad and nothing else.Every one is jumping in it to make some quick profits till it lasts.\nFrom battle royale genre I have only played PUBG & H1Z1 & I liked the later more. The current state of H1Z1 however is not good & I think PUBG will soon follow its path too.\nI think the devs are aware of this too thats why they are trying to grab as much as they could during this time.\n\nAnyways I have nothing against them personally its their decision to make money in whichever way they see fit.Currently I have not much interest in this game.\nIn the end I would just say getting it or not is completely your decision.\n\nPlease feel free to join here to discuss more on games: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/wtil", "timestamp_created": 1519716990, "timestamp_updated": 1530209910, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.793261885643005371", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39060942": {"recommendationid": "39060942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169256140", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 66093, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1423, "last_played": 1551781956}, "language": "english", "review": "Im sick of playing with Chinese players on the North American servers.

The game tends to be unstable, no matter what fixes I have attempted, and the idea of having bullets render every time they are shot is honestly the singlemost terrible development model in the history of game development. There's nothing like being shot to death because the game suddenly decides it has to render those bullets, therefore causing a sudden lagspike that ruins any aspect of \"competition\" this game hoped to achieve. \n\nAnother point is that the loot distribution system seems completely off-balance. Sometimes you can drop in an area where you'd expect to get high-risk high-reward loot, and come out with level one gear and a shotgun if you're lucky. Meanwhile, Bobby and his friends went to that quiet little outpost in the middle of nowhere and got all the loot he could ever dream of. It feels like the entire loot system needs an overhaul, and the distribution sorting out because there's nothing better than getting nailed by the guy with a fully kitted M24 while you're rocking a Micro-uzi and level 1 armour.\n\nAlso, the current bug with diving from the plane where if you press literally ANY KEY on your keyboard, and you get locked into diving straight down, unable to change your course unless you pull you parachute is something that was present on the test server. But did they fix it? No, they did not. They were too focused on getting Vikeni out in time for Christmas so people would want to play their game again and buy their season pass, and gamble their money away on the off chance they get something absolutely amazing from a chest after spending $$$ on keys and getting the same items over and over and over again.\n\nNow, I know that complaining about the loot boxes will most likely elicit responses such as \"Don't buy them then\", and the same goes for the premium season passes. Yes, I could not buy them, and I won't, because honestly, the chances of getting something good from a loot box is abysmal, and you're more likely to get the same cosmetic item and over and over and over again, which leads to frustration, and it feels like it's less \"random\" and more \"you're highly likely to get this item because of the set %\". If it was meant to be totally random RNG, the chances would be somewhat similar. Yes, I understand that rarer items deserve a lower drop rate, but having the same common item drop time and time again leaves much to be desired, and also tends to leave a rather sour taste in the person's mouth as though they'd just sucked on a lemon slice.\n\nAs for that, didn't EA get hammered for their microtransactions and loot boxes? Why should any other company get away with borderline gambling in a game that was designed for enjoyment? Nothing is stopping little Jim from grabbing his parent's credit card and blowing a bit of money to try and get absolutely nothing desirable. Gambling, in its purest form is described as such:\n\n\"Gambling is taking part in a game during which you risk money, or something of monetary value, in order to win money or a prize. The outcome of the game is usually down to chance, so when gambling you might leave with less money than you started off with, and sometimes with nothing at all.\" - quoted from https://www.begambleaware.org/understanding-gambling/\n\nSo, that money people are spending on keys?

Because in essence, they are gambling, and ANYONE can participate, as long as they have the money to do so. You cannot write off one company's loot box problem saying \"Oh, it's different\", when another is having lawsuits presented to them over \"unlawful\" actions.\n\nAll in all, I cannot recommend this game, not because of the way the company attempts to grab any and all cash they can, but because the game is severely lacking in bug fixes that REALLY need to be addressed, but they are taking their time in doing so, instead introducing new mechanics and new maps as priorities.\n\nI'd give it a 2/10, purely because it managed to drain so many hours of my life away, and left much to be desired.", "timestamp_created": 1546465796, "timestamp_updated": 1546467563, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 213, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.825407207012176514", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39722137": {"recommendationid": "39722137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035843767", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 18192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545419573}, "language": "english", "review": "Originally written on Jan 30th, 2018.\n\nSept. 29th, 2018 update: Hackers are still as present as ever, just in the last game I played I watched a single chinaman instantly headshot 8-10 people without ever aiming downsight from 200-300 meters away.\n\n\nThe problem is still a strong mixture of the Chinese playerbase's rampant abuse of hacks and the devs doing absolutely nothing to fix the problem.

If I could return the game at this point I would. I hate that I have given money to a company that cares so little about their fanbase. - TL;DR\n\n\nI've got quite a few hours in this game, not enough to be a no-life but enough to know how it is. Let me break some things down for you about this game.\n\n\nIt's almost unplayable. The sheer number of cheaters (literally almost all if not all are from China) has been growing steadily for over a month. Ever since more and more Chinese players have migrated to the North American servers the  population of cheaters has skyrocketed. Allow me to list what will happen to you regularly:\n\n- You will join a lobby and all you will hear is a dozen plus voices shouting in Chinese with the occasion expletive in English. \n- You will drop and find supplies as normal\n- You will run in to a solo/group/duo/etc. as expected\n- Instead of banter during the firefight all you hear is shrieking and yelling in Chinese (They talk in-game A LOT for some reason)\n- You will be instantly shot in the head after you leave cover (often before too) by somebody who was 100 meters+ away and was not even aiming down their sights, just hip firing.\n- You will be angry that you were killed by a cheater\n- You will take a break for a few minutes\n- You will go back to the top of this list.\n\nLiterally of the last 5 games I have played 4 of my 5 deaths have been to Chinese who were cheating on the North American servers. I will tell the story of the last death.\n\nPartner and I were on a rooftop picking up a couple items, I see two players brazenly jogging down the middle of the road, one not wearing pants (A telltale sign it is a Chinese player), and tell my partner to get ready to attack them. At this point we have not at any point crested the barrier between us, but the enemy player in front of the duo has been looking directly at my position on a roof in the middle of town the whole way down the road. I told my partner to shoot and within a half second of him standing and taking his first shot he was knocked on the ground, I had also stood up when I said to shoot and I was on the ground almost instantly after my partner. Watching the death cam revealed the instant we both stood up the same player headshot both of us, while running, while firing from the hip. Their target reticule was as large as it could possibly be, yet they managed to hit both of us in the head twice in less than a second at 50 meters while moving and not aiming. \n\nYou could think it was a wildly lucky shot, but when the same scenario has happened twice before tonight alone, it isn't coincidence that all the players doing this magical shots are all Chinese and assuredly cheating. \n\nI'm not bad at the game, I have multiple wins under my belt, I know what a good player acts like, and none of the Chinese players who kill me act like that.\n\n\nThe game is broken. Not because of in-game glitches or errors (of which there are more than a few, freezing on start is a big one) but because there are hundreds of thousands of cheaters, literally. The developers of the game have openly admitted that a vast majority of the cheating players are Chinese, but sternly refuse to region lock the game and keep the Chinese players on the Chinese servers. They claim it is \"unfair\" to keep the \"good players\" out because of \"a few bad eggs\" However a \"few bad eggs\" is the majority of over 1,500,000 banned cheaters. It is more unfair to the few Chinese players that do not cheat to be forced to play with all their cheating brethren than it is to the entirety of the EU, NA, SA, SEA, etc. communities and players, who are all burdened by the massive influx of cheaters from a single region.\n\n\nI cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone so long as the developers refuse to take any real action against the game ruining cheats that are running rampant throughout their game.

The developers managed to turn this game into absolute garbage: \n\n- Doesn't matter what kind of PC you have: Crashes, Stutters, FPS Drops 24/7\n- Doesn't matter how fast your internet is: Their servers don't give a damn\n- Doesn't matter how good of a player you are: You die to game bugs, lags, freezes, crashes, desync ent.\n- Doesn't matter if developers see these comments: You get crates with fancy clothes to dress your character and patches that continue to ruin the gameplay and performance.\n- Doesn't matter that new maps are released: All of them are unplayable due to the horrible server performance/netcode\n- Doesn't matter if you actually want to play: \"Servers are too busy. Please try again later.\"\n\nA few examples:\n* You land with a large group o people around that try to defeat you, you find a weapon, you can not pick up the weapon because the game lags out HARD (no matter the internet connection), you die to someone who had \"server luck\" on their side and actually picked up a weapon.\n* You try to remain stealthy and silent so people don't spot you, you die because someone followed you by seeing your bugged out weapon models randomly hanging in the air on the path you took before.\n* You get shot at, you see who it is and hide behind a big ass rock. You are perfectly hidden, the guy doesn't see you and shoots at the air near the rock, you die because these shots hit you. (Confirmed with death-cam)\n* You run into a guy, blast a shotgun right into his chest/face at close range, (blood shows confirming you hit him) but somehow he's perfectly fine, shoots you and kills you, you check the death cam - his HP remained full all the time.\n\nAll examples above do not occur rarely, but daily and theres much more.

Still won't be playing this game in the future due to the treatment I've had thus far from the mods/devs.", "timestamp_created": 1503540813, "timestamp_updated": 1508966629, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7031, "votes_funny": 530, "weighted_vote_score": "0.848999142646789551", "comment_count": 278, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "41547305": {"recommendationid": "41547305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198416624152", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 68, "last_played": 1551786948}, "language": "english", "review": "They should make training map so people can practice their aim.", "timestamp_created": 1524009517, "timestamp_updated": 1524009517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1672, "votes_funny": 80, "weighted_vote_score": "0.919197559356689453", "comment_count": 64, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "41616845": {"recommendationid": "41616845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118768239", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 20742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549522074}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey developers, do you guys know there are a lot of people who are blatantly selling hacking softwares on the leaderboard?
