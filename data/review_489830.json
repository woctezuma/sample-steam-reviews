I love it SO much! It has actually scared me some times because of dragons coming out of no where and attacking me but that just adds to the thrill of this awesome, huge, free-roam type of game! I love all of the different types of monsters &/or creatures and all the awesome quests to keep you busy so you never get bored. I thank the creators of this game including everyone who helped and worked on it as well. It's such an awesome game, so much exploring, adventuring, having kids, buying houses, making your own house (which is what I'm doing lol) and so much more! I absolutely LOVE this game! <3", "timestamp_created": 1549862369, "timestamp_updated": 1549862369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.776949584484100342", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49373003": {"recommendationid": "49373003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095592563", "num_games_owned": 1008, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 18040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548982915}, "language": "english", "review": "Only just realised I didn't write a review for this game.\n\nThis game with mod support can pile 1000s of hours of game time and playability and this is must play. I have lost count to how many times I've replayed this game as different species and classes. I first played on xbox 360 as a heavy weapon melee argonian, then on xbox one as a high elf destruction class and light weapon khajit then on PC as a dark elf archer and conjurer.\n\nYou take the role as Dragonborn which in simpler terms, a person who can shout very loud at dragons. You are powerful and harness dragon souls and power as the game goes on. The game on special edition looks great especially on PC but I wouldn't say it needed a new game. This game has so much content and player choice/decision to quests and options that effect the game. The DLC is adds a ton new items, quests and content too which is worth even more for picking it up. You have control over the course of the game with what you do and how you do it. The locations are scattered with loot and the fact that half the map you don't aren't even required to look into shows how much you can get out of this game. There is so much to do and if that wasn't already enough, the mods that are available add even more with more items and locations.\n\nThis wouldn't be a bethesda game without a ton of glitches and bugs but I won't even go into detail on them, you'll experience it all when you play the game but the game is too superior to be concerned about that. Honestly, play this game and experience it in all it's glory. It is far ahead of it's time and you don't want to miss playing and experiencing this game. The unique weapons and npcs throughout the game make the player have mini checklists for items like daedric or collecting sets.\n\nThe different factions, species and outcomes to the game allow for multiple replays of experiencing different scenarios in the game. Joining the companions, Joining the Imperials, Joining the Brotherhood, Joining the Storm cloaks and more. Being an orc, nord, elf. Choosing Dawnguard or Volkihar.\n\nTHIS GAME IS A MUST HAVE, IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT THEN GET IT NOW AND IF YOU HAVE IT THEN PLAY IT AGAIN.\n\n11/10", "timestamp_created": 1551788517, "timestamp_updated": 1551788662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.67310023307800293", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49396071": {"recommendationid": "49396071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006123780", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "last_played": 1551882958}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want the original Skyrim game + DLCs,\nSteam and Bethesda keeps it hidden here:\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/\n\nand the DLCs here:\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/220760/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Hearthfire/\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/226880/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dragonborn/\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/211720/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dawnguard/\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/202485/Skyrim_High_Resolution_Texture_Pack_Free_DLC/", "timestamp_created": 1551883194, "timestamp_updated": 1551883194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.644814133644104004", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49073196": {"recommendationid": "49073196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367653596", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3304, "last_played": 1551813730}, "language": "english", "review": "So great.

With the vast open world to explore (not including Solstheim) and the amount of work you put into upgrading your character, as well as alternate paths you can take in the main quests (joining the Stormcloaks or the Imperials), you definitely get your time's worth out of this game.  \n\nYes, this game is buggy as hell, and sometimes works to your disadvantage (I had accidentally killed off key characters in side quests thinking they served their purpose after encountering them, with the quest continuing anyway).  But I feel the beauty of Bethesda is, despite their clear lack of game programming skill, they quickly make up for it by incidentally making the game quirky (in a good way).  As shown from some content creators (Vinesauce especially), the game's glitches are actually entertaining to watch and add to the wonders you can explore while venturing in Skyrim.

This mixed with the new graphics from the special edition makes it SO enjoyable, even when you role-play warming up for 5 minutes next to a fire pit.\nMods i use:\n- Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition: this fixes most of the bugs of the game\n- Campfire: Lets you build a campfire and different sorts of tents\n- Vivid weathers: Over 500+ Weathers with different sounds and adjustable brightness, shadows, etc.\n- Frostfall: Depending on how difficult you want it, you can even freeze to death and rain makes you be wet and get colder faster\n-  Wet and Cold: Same thing but mostly for NPCs. Also includes some other features like blurry screen when you look up while it's rainning or snowing.\n-  Point the way: Since i'm looking for some realism i avoid fast travelling, this is why i got this mod, which shows me the way to every city at every crossroad.\n- Lampposts of Skrim: Lamp posts on the main roads, but just what is necessary, not plenty of them.\n- Waves: Now beaches with waves :D\n- Better horses: Now horses go faster than you by foot, something that makes kind of sense.\n- Less agressive animals: Just makes less agressive small animals like rats or crabs. Was kind of ridiculous to see a crab trying to fight imperial soldiers.\n- Hunter's Reward - Better prices: Able to skin and sell pelts for a reasonable price in case you wanna play as a hunter.\n- iNeed: To eat, to drink and to Sleep is now necessary and rewardable.\n- Holidays: Skyrim has special days like our christmas and all that stuff\n- Expanded Carriage Service: Carriage service in places where you couldn't find them before, like Morthal or Dawnstar.\n- Rich merchants of Skyrim: Merchants have more money to buy, meaning that you don't need to walk around all skyrim to sell the stuff. (1000 septims was humiliating for a merchant TBH)\n- Run for your lives: When a dragon attacks people run off instead of trying to smack the dragon.\n- When vampires attack: Same with vampires\n- The Paarthurnax Dilemma: Lets you spare his life. \n- Hold border banners: Banners from different holds are placed on their borders, pretty simple but cool enough for me.\n- Immersive patrols SE: Since there's a civil war going on, it's weird not to see any battle along the way until you join one of the sides of the war. With this mod you can find these fights while you walk around. Make other kind of patrols available, like the dawnguard.\n- Practice Dummies: You can use them to improve your skill till level 30 out of 100. That means that you don't need to deal with badass foes with the skill \"i barely know how to hold the sword\".\n- Mammoth Pelts: You can skin mammoths, something that i still don't get why it wasn't allowed in the original game.\n- Dog followers are Huskies: Makes it cooler and makes sense too since Skyrim is the north.\n- Whistle: Lets you whistle to the horse to make him come over, avoiding to search for the damn horse every time he flees from a battle.\n- NPC's Run and Walk at your pace:  exactly what the mod says.\n- Animal poverty: Animals don't drop gold. Like they have a bank account or something...\n- Immersive armors: adds different kind of armors and shields. The more smithing perks you got the more armors will show up. (Showed in auxiliary armors)\n- MamTuskPowderGrind: You can grind  mammoth tusk to make its powder, an ingredient that was so hard to find and wasn't allowed (don't know why) to make it out from the normal tusks.\n- Fantasy Soundtrack Project: Replaces the original music OR adds its songs to the original music. Just necessary if after all these hundreds of hours you got tired of the original one.\n- Enhaced blood textures: MORE BLOOD!\n- Skyland: Landscape texture overhaul\n- Static Mesh Improvement Mod: Better textures for interiors.\n- Skyrim better roads: More and better textures for main roads.\n- Verdant: Better textures for grass.\n- Blacksmith forge water fix se: Makes the water from the blacksmith look real. Yeah... once you realize you need it.\n- Realistic water two: Improves A LOT water textures and effects.\n- Open cities Skyrim: No loading screen when you get into a city (this needs a patch to work with Ineed mod)\n- Immersive Citizens: their behaviour and dialogues are more real. (needs a patch to work with Open cities)\nBTW, i got them in this order and all of them work properly\n\nSome of the mods are only available on nexusmods, which leads me to my final advise: Download the mod \"noble skyrim\". Improves SO MUCH the city textures and buildings. There's just one problem, it has been ported to special edition but still remains on original skyrim from nexus: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45807/? \nThere are two options, wait till it's completely ported to SSE or download it manually from original skyrim and install it manually from Nexus Mod Manager as well. It won't show up on the list, but it will be there, so don't worry.

The only major differences are:\n\n+ 64 bit engine rework. This largely means that it can use more RAM, and not run into memory issues quite so often as the original Skyrim did. This is, in theory, good for modders, as they can add significantly more content into the worldspace without running into the 3.3GB limit. \n\n+ Runs a little more smoothly and stably. I haven't noticed any crashes yet. Framerate is significantly more stable on lower end hardware than original Skyrim.\n\n+ Due to engine overhauls and increased memory, larger scale battles are possible. Of course, these aren't implemented; but in original Skyrim, if you spawn significant numbers of NPCs that are in combat you may notice some simply don't fight back. In Skyrim Special Edition, these extra NPCs can fight properly.\n\n+ Graphics are slightly improved, and a few bugs are fixed. Textures are somewhat higher resolution - don't know just how much, and i believe meshes are slightly improved in detail as well? Z-Fighting, a long standing engine issue where two textures overlapped (especially noticeable with distance mountains) and the renderer couldn't decide which one to show on top, resulting in rapid flicker between the two textures.\n\n+ It's Skyrim. It's incredibly fun, and will drain all your free time. It's made even better by modding, but this leads on to the next point.\n\n- There are very few mods available for it. Much of the original Skyrim's modding community relied on a script extender called SKSE, by the wonderful folks over at Silverlock, known for their script extender plugins for various Gamebryo/Creation engine games by Bethesda. As a result, while big name unscripted mods (ie. texture replacements, mesh replacements, and certain mods that modify existing data without relying on scripting) have been ported, there is a significant gap in user-friendliness as a result. \n\n- The user interface has not been overhauled one bit. It is still the clunky, designed-for-console, made by crab people for crab people mess that it always was, with cascading menus. For original Skyrim, there was an incredible mod called SkyUI, which used SKSE to entirely overhaul the menu systems to a more mouse-and-keyboard friendly setup. SkyUI also created a \"mod configuration menu\", which allowed users with mods to, well, modify various parameters in the mods without having to use a scripted item that gets added to the player's inventory, like in the days of Oblivion. Skyrim Special Edition entirely lacks SkyUI, as SKSE64 is still in development, and SkyUI is unlikely to be ported as it is a finished project.\n\n- There is no new content. The three DLC packs, Hearthfire, Dragonborn and Dawnguard all come bundled with SSE, but there is no added content by bethesda. Well, that's a lie, some items are available when they were not previously, like the nigh-useless Torturer's Hood. But there are no new quests, nothing.\n\n- Graphically speaking, SSE looks like the original version of Skyrim with a couple of basic graphical improvement mods added, stuff like Purity, SMIM (static mesh improvement mod) and similar. It is starting to look somewhat dated, as the game itself is six years old now (I know!)\n\nIn short:\n\nBuy this if you want slightly improved graphics and stability, with a smaller modding community that is still struggling to get off the ground. It's still selling for $39USD last I checked, where original Skyrim is $34USD for the base game and $55USD for the game plus DLC. \n\nSo yeah, it's cheaper than original Skyrim, but it is also hampered by the main thing that makes Bethesda games long lasting; its moddability.\n\nHonestly, I'd say it's worth paying more for the original game for its extensive library of mods, but if you aren't a person into modding or one who hasn't played Skyrim before (those exist?), get this.", "timestamp_created": 1493879447, "timestamp_updated": 1493879447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 158, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.923103749752044678", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29720711": {"recommendationid": "29720711", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989440581", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 8537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545862356}, "language": "english", "review": "If you already played 900h of the original game, there is no point for you to buy this.\n\nHowever, if you're like me and never finished the original Skyrim, or you live under a rock, never heard of this and looking for something to invest your precious time into while your wife and kids are gone, this is most likely more morally acceptable than anything else you think of doing right now.", "timestamp_created": 1486306410, "timestamp_updated": 1486306410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 273, "votes_funny": 237, "weighted_vote_score": "0.93013232946395874", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47598525": {"recommendationid": "47598525", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996511243", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546300675}, "language": "english", "review": "Last good game from bethesda, but in Special Edition bethesda remove steam workshop and replaced it with Creation Club Credits for money.

You've never played Skyrim before and you don't know what you're doing.\n2. You'd like to play a prettier version of Skyrim without mods.\n\nI personally have spent quite a lot of time on this game already but always fell back to spending more time modding it than actually playing the game. Mods are lots of fun and fix so many issues this game have, there are tons I love and would recommended... But if you're like me and you would like [i]actually finishing[/i] your games, it might be a better idea to play the game vanilla to avoid going insane.\n\nThis edition is great for that. You have all those little graphical enhancements built-in and (mostly) glitch free, don't expect anything new content-wise though.\n\nIf you already own the base version and didn't get this for free, don't buy it. You can get more or less the same result with mods, spending an extra $50+ on a small visual rework is not worth it.\n\nAs for the actual game, I'm sure most people know of Skyrim by now so I'll try to avoid the more obvious things:\n\nSkyrim is very popular for a reason, it's a great RPG. It's a great game and the amount of content is insane, definitely a game  a lot of people can sink a lot of hours into. Great as it is however, it's also full of flaws. Filled. A foundation of mistakes. Oblivion and Skyrim (I haven't played Morrowind very much so I can't really comment on it) are what I've considered my favorite video games for a long time and as much as I would like to say they are perfect, there are so many things about them that frustrate me and make the game not as enjoyable as it could have been.\n\nThe main issue with Skyrim is that it fails to innovate. It wasn't as much of an issue in 2011 but seeing the game getting re-re-re-re-released and seeing what Fallout 4 ended up being makes me extremely worried for the future of the series. I think the biggest problem is that the game is founded on old mentalities, old video game design. It's as if most of the game is the way it is because \"that's how video games are\" than because it makes sense.\n\nThere are countless mechanics that are tracked but cannot be seen, the interface and stats are extremely lackluster. I can understand the argument for \"Immersion\" but in a game that boasts an incredible amount of content, not being able to track my progress drives me nuts. Most of the interface doesn't work well with KBM and was clearly designed with consoles in mind. Not being able to sort through your inventory, through storage etc. There is so much about this game that almost forces you to be disorganised and inneficient.\n\nEngine-wise, while there is a significant leap in visuals, the Special Edition JUST now fixed the dreaded and ancient alt-tab issue. The game doesn't run particurlarly well, never properly supported borderless windowed, never supported refresh rates above 60 FPS without messing up physics. Every interior is instanced. Even if they're fast you constantly have loading screens.\n\nYour first couple of hours will be filled with wonder and a thirst for exploration you can never quench. You will however realize that there isn't much more to discover than in a randomly generated game after that, unless you are very dense. Most of the loot is randomly generated, enemies respawn, so many locations re-use the same asset to the point where they look nearly identical (when they kept boasting about the fact that each dungeon had been hand-crafted... they just failed to mention that hand-crafted means a couple rooms manually paired together in different orders). Unique assets are so rare that you feel like you've discovered something amazing when you see one, even if it's insignificant.\n\nBack on efficiency; This game wants you to be inneficient so bad. You can pick up everything. Most people that never played a game like this will [i]want[/i] to pick up a bunch of stuff because they assume it come in handy, to resell it or whatever. The truth is, there is no point. Most of the stuff in this game is useless. In fact, even the things that [i]should[/i] be useful is useless. I've only made one character on Skyrim SE and it was my sixth in total. It's the first character I've decided to play efficiently and complete everything with.\n\nThere is a very important concept where items will have more or less value depending on their weight. It's very simple but most people won't think about it. All you have to do is divide the value in gold by the weight to get the septims:weight ratio and you'll soon realize that a 30 weight mace that's worth 300 gold is actually garbage compared to something that's 1 weight and over 10 gold. Because of that, gems and potions are always worth picking up and will have insane ratios whereas most equipment is useless. I know it's stupid but the moment you start planing what you pick up with that in mind, you can basically just run through everything and ignore most of the loot yet become rich.\n\nSome quests are fun and interesting. The rest you wonder why they're there at all. Why would you spend so much time completing a tedious quest that hardly has more to it than something out of an MMO when the reward is the amount of gold you would get selling some random trinket you'll find just about anywhere. Dialogues are neither interesting or engaging, they'll often drag on for too long and your \"choices\" are only really there to give you a voice because they usually change very little to how things unfold. This honestly ruins so many of the actually interesting, fun or original quests in the game. There is so much content that could have been cut without affecting the quality. The guild questlines and daedric quests are some of the only memorable ones.\n\nSpeaking of which, the game suffers so much from letting you do whatever you want and go wherever you please. For two reasons:\n\n1. Most of the game has to scale in difficulty based on your progression in the game, which results in weird things like overpowered wolves (not as much of an issue in Skyrim than it was in Oblivion).\n2. You are constantly being sent all around the world without ever feeling like you're \"done\" with anything.\n\nFreedom is something a lot of people like in a game. However, I believe that if you need to rely on scaling difficulty, you haven't designed the game well. I wish some areas were more dangerous than others. I wish I couldn't go places because the enemies are too tough. I wish I'd face an enemy that makes me go \"WHAT THE FUCK\" and only come back once I feel I've become strong enough. Those take away from the experience so much for me. Being allowed to do whatever you want is one thing, being [i]able[/i] to is another.\n\nOne last thing: The combat is not interesting, no matter how you see it. That's what you spend the most time doing and it's just not fun. You end up cheesing it all the time because the tools you're giving just don't really work that well. Progression sounds exciting but in practice it's boring (spells are a good example). By the time you're that strong, the game won't be challenging anyway and if it is, it won't feel like a challenge, it'll feel like a chore.\n\nOne game that fixes nearly all these issues for me is The Witcher 3. I found it better in nearly every aspects and it makes me sad because I love the elder scrolls. Seeing Fallout 4 shows me that Bethesda is not willing to re-think how they make games and what makes them fun. I expect TES VI to be the same I've seen with their games since 2006. I still expect loading when I go inside houses. I still expect face close ups when I talk to people. I still expect a clunky first-person combat system.\n\nNevertheless and surprisingly enough, I still recommend this game. Play it! It's fun for the most part.", "timestamp_created": 1513650304, "timestamp_updated": 1513650304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 307, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.924731016159057617", "comment_count": 39, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "41973446": {"recommendationid": "41973446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198820810071", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 38055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549899836}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a  50 yr old female who is not a big gamer.

Skyrim Legendary Edition costs 50% more than Special Edition, yet Special Edition has the same content and runs better?!\n- 64 bit! This makes the game much more stable, and the crashes are very few and far between\n- Not limited to 2GB of ram. This adds lots of stability, and crashes such as \"Out of memory!\" are completely non-existant\n- HD Textures w/o mods/DLC ( This speaks for itself )\n- Looks good without an ENB, something Oldrim doesn't do. ENBs are however still an option, and make the game even sexier\n- Extreme Stability. Skyrim Special Edition has in my experience, only crashed once. I run 214 mods ( Over 46GB! ), a photorealistic ENB, 4K Textures, and SKSE and my game has crashed one time only, and it was due to an extreme amount of NPCs I spawned in.\n\n[h1] About the \"disadvantages\" people talk about [/h1]\n- Creation Club is absolute shit, and if you buy from it, fuck you. Other than that, there's nothing Oldrim does better.\n- SKSE, many people complain about SE lacking in this. This is however, not true. As of December, SKSE64 works perfectly for SE and is completely up to date.\n- Less mods. This is true, however, all good mods have been ported, and there's many mods that are extremely amazing that are SE only. And seriously, if you want a mod on SE so badly, but it's not on SE, you can port it over yourself.

There's no other games like it, not even other Elder Scrolls games could compare to it.\nGetting into skyrim has always been very easy. From the character creation to killing your first legendary dragon - you always feel immersed. The world is alive, the fighting is engaging and the scenery... oh god the scenery. You can compare skyrim to other games, saying that it has outdated graphics, but skyrim doesn't use textures to look beatiful. No, skyrim uses it's design.\nIt's one of these games where anyone could make a screenshot that look gorgeous. It's a game with soundtrack so magical that people make compilations of sounds and scenery just to play in the background of their daily lifes.\nI absolutely adore this game and if you've never played it then i strongly encourage you to try it out. Believe me, skiping this game for any reason is not a good idea.\n\nEven though you may think i'm just a skyrim fanboy from the amount of praise i give to this game i still try to also aknowledge it's flaws. Yes, it has bugs. Yes, it has issues with it's gameplay. Yes, the skills screen is absolutely disgusting and they should've made a better one.\n\nSkyrim is not perfect. If you want my objective review then i would hardly give it even a 7 out of 10. If i was a game critic i could even write an article that destroys this game by saying \"it's quests are boring, it's scenery is shallow and it's fighting is dumb\". And maybe some parts of it would be true. But i am not a game critic and i would never want to be one. And you are not reading this for a game critic's review. You are reading this for an honest review of just some guy that likes videogames. And that guy would give this game a solid 9, based on the impact this game had on him.\n\nNow to the nasty part of this review.\nAs a person that adored bethesda for some time i seem to be more and more disappointed in them with every game they made these last 3 years. Fallout 4 was the last game i would actually play and it still wasn't giving me the same chills skyrim or fallout new vegas did.\n\nMy disapointment started with the announcement of this version of skyrim - the \"Special Edition\". long story short - it made the water look better and some graphics look nicer. Other than that it was the same game, even though i think the reasoning of making it was to release it anywhere they could. \nAnd then they introduced \"The Creation Club\". I was kinda enraged by it since they were bringing back paid mods but after i saw the \"These mods are going to be extra cool\" i decided to not hate it without at least seeing what it would turn out to be. \nAnd after two years of checking it out i have now come to the conclusion that I absolutely despise it. It is the worst type of paid mods they could make. It has FU\u0421KING CLOTHING IN IT. CLOTHING, SKINS AND OTHER DUMB SHI\u0422 THAT SHOULD BE FREE BUT NONONO IT'S NOT FREE BECAUSE SOMEBODY SPENT TIME MAKING THAT ROBE. As a person that is generally accepting of a lot of things game studios do my only thoughts every time i see creation club are \"FUC\u041a YOU TOO\". Yes, they also made some actual game content like a bad survival mode and some zombie crap but i don't even want to start to describe how bad they are.\n\nAnd the shi\u0422storm was only starting. Turned out that bethesda turns off your achievements if you play with mods. How on earth did they think of that i do not know since sometimes their games break in ways only mods can fix.\nThe last thing they did to skyrim that made me the most angry was hiding the original version from the search so now you can only buy the \"special edition\" one that had MORE BUGS THAN THE ORIGINAL at launch.\n\nbtw here's the link to original skyrim to anyone who wants to buy it, although i dont really see any point of doing that since the special edition is objectively better: https://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/\n\nafterwards there was fallout 76 and some more dumb decisions they made and now i can not say that i would support them as a company.\n\nso, should you buy skyrim? yes.\nshould you buy skyrim: special edition? yes. despite all of bethesda's flaws they still didn't make it worse than the original and in some ways it is actually better.\nwould i encourage you to trust bethesda as a company? no. take everything with a pinch of salt. at least before they redeem themselves.", "timestamp_created": 1546434049, "timestamp_updated": 1546434049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 133, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.878502070903778076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35917580": {"recommendationid": "35917580", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960441515", "num_games_owned": 1774, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507263285}, "language": "english", "review": "Bethesda being Bethesda.\nZERO RESPECT given to the community, mostly modders.\n\nThis is what happened:\n\n1) They make a VERY good game, which is called Skyrim - it had some terrible bugs, which were all fixed by some unofficial patches, all FOR FREE, done by people that LOVE(D) the game!!!!!\nIt was not Bethesda that fixed the bugs (some game breaking), it was not Skyrim Special Edition.

I used to play Skyrim on Xbox 360 when I was younger for hours and hours on end every day and probably put in over 1000 hours in total just on Xbox 360. I then bought the Special Edition when I bought an Xbox One mainly for the mods as well as to relive the experience, I wasn't too impressed with the mods on Xbox One but I still ended up putting around 600 hours into the game. Finally, I bought a PC which I later bought Skyrim Special Edition for, and realised the mods on pc are incredible in comparison to Xbox. Although Skyrim is filled with bugs and other issues there is no way I could not recommend it. This game is absolutely amazing and I would highly recommend it to everyone and especially to people who like RPG games.\n\n[u]Rating:[/u]\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1540980796, "timestamp_updated": 1540983033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.803332984447479248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30109382": {"recommendationid": "30109382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093331415", "num_games_owned": 332, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 9188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546091607}, "language": "english", "review": "[This is a PC review of the game]\nWhen The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition came out, I really took a disliking to it. I knew that there would be no added quests or anything like that - that is was literally a slight graphical and performance overhaul. Now, anyone that has played the original Skyrim will know that it needed a performance overhaul from day one, so this \"Remastered\" game really got our attention. \n\nWhile remastered does come with the DLC all included, it is rather expensive in comparison to Skyrim. I have to put it out there now, that I don't think it is worth full price, [b]ESPECIALLY[/b] not if you own the old game. It doesn't add enough new content to warrant that price. \n\nPerformance:\nThe Skyrim Special Edition game makes a better use of the power and capabilities behind 64-bit operating systems. The older game would only use certain amounts of your VRAM and power from other various components of your PC. As a result, the game was quite clunky to play, even at times without mods. Many people would go on to mod it, and like myself, some did it quite heavily. The technical limitations of the game in this way soon presented problems in the forms of frequent CTD's (Crashes to Desktop) and infinate freezes / load screens. I have not had these issues [b]as frequently[/b] with Skyrim Special Edition. That, however, is not to say it's free of them either. \n\nWhen actually playing the game, it does feel much smoother than the original one. Sudden freezes, and that clunky stop and start feel have been almost entirely eliminated, and even with a few mods (I've started modding it already) it runs like you'd expect a game should do. \n\nGraphics:\nThe remastered game has faced graphical improvements too. The game has its own built in ENB now, and consequently it looks a lot smoother. Grass and trees have been edited to look slightly better than the original game, and grass is more dense. Not as dense as mods will get it, but nonetheless, there is more of it. I like this, but wish they had gone further with it. \n\nThe view range, and the quality of the view that you see has aslo been improved. You can see further out, and it is in more detail. I like this a lot as it feels much more immersive than watching stuff load in in front of you. \n\nWeather systems have been improved too. There are some really quite nice vanilla ambiances and weathers that appear throughout the game, and this was a nice change to the dull, grey feel of the last game. \n\nHaving said all of that, I did still feel let down by how little the game had changed, and how much better most of us modders had done it on the old game. \n\nModding:\nUnfortunately, Bethesda really screwed up the modding system. I understand that the game was made so that console users could also experience modding, I feel that was done at the cost of the PC users. The idea behind using Bethesda.net to download mods for the game is about as reliable as using the Steam workshop on the old game. If you mod properly, you're going to run in to a lot of issues with it. Thankfully, for PC users, Nexus Mod Manager and LOOT did come to save the day, but nonetheless, I have to criticise Bethesda's thinking on that one. \n\nUnfortunatley, the one thing that kept the last game alive so long - modders - were kinda shafted on this one too. I am not this well-informed on mod creation, but the updated game has changed the way in which mods work / need to be made. As a result of this, some of our most-needed mods such as SkyUI and SKSE are not yet with us, and from that, any former users will agree, we all suffer. There has been nothing to suggest that these mods, and many others that we lost, will not come eventually, but it will take a while. \n\nVerdict:\nOverall, I think this game was a bit of a money grab to be honest. I, while I still do like it, am not 'satisfied' with it as such. What little has changed hasn't made such a massive difference to the game that it warrants paying over doubble the proce of the old game. Because I love Skyrim itself, I have to give it a strong 10/10, but as a NEW game - a remaster, I can't give it more than a 4/10 really. In my opinion, it's not good enough. However, I got it free because I owned all the content from the old game, so I am not too unhappy. If I'd paid for it I would be. \n\nIf you've never played Skyrim before, and you're on console, this will appeal to you, and it would be worth it for you, perhaps, but I don't feel it brought anything new to the PC front. The modding community is still ahead of this game. Ultimatly though, I can't dislike it. It is (because it's Skyrim) an amazing game. \n\nThank you for reading my review!\n\nTalos be with you all.\n\nP.S. Sorry, can I just tag this on the end. Characters still look [b]TERRIBLE[/b]. A lack of mods means you have to play as the most ugly, dirty, wrinkled, shrivelled, potato-looking cretin I have ever seen in a game.

The graphics, after all, look only marginally better than vanilla Skyrim, and actually appear worse than Legendary Edition with an ENB. \nBelow the surface, though, there are tons of improvements.\n[list]\n[*]Skyrim Special Edition no longer has screen-tearing. No matter how quickly up and down you move your head, there are no screen tears [i]at all[/i], and I'm still amazed at how much it increases the immersion.\n[*]There are no more flickering mountains. Gone are the days when distant mountains would be white one moment, black the next.\n[*]The snow is beautiful. As the snow falls, some of the flakes on the ground capture light and appear to sparkle. While Skyrim was already a magnificent world, this effect makes it even more so. \n[*]The colors are deeper. Vanilla Skyrim is bleak and Legendary modded Skyrim is often too bright and over-saturated. Special Edition, however, seeks to find the balance between the two and does succeed tremendously.\n[*]LOD improvement. Legendary Skyrim saw buildings pop up in the distance as you came towards them, but Special Edition has made an effort to render practically everything in the entire world to increase immersion. Fortresses, cities, and even tall trees can be seen quite far away.\n[*]Towns have bright windows during the night. The windows in buildings such as Dragonsreach are lit during the night, and the lights can be seen from miles away. This gives screenshots taken during the night something to focus on. \n[*]Water improvements. Water interacts with stones and banks in its way, slapping against them or changing direction.\n[*]Better waterfall and windmall LOD. You can see the blades of windmills turning and waterfalls churning from very far away.\n[*]Skyrim Special Edition's sky looks utterly fantastic. Whether the stars or the Northern Lights dominate the night, you can count on having a lot to appreciate.\n[*]No more stuttering when traveling between Skyrim's different areas. \n[*]64-bit physiology means that Skyrim is [i]extremely[/i] stable. The only times Special Edition has crashed were when I attempted to transfer my heavily-modded Legendary save over to Special Edition.\n\nWeaknesses include:\n[*]Hair still looks pitiful, especially for the Nords and Bretons.\n[*]Not all textures have been improved.\n[*]There were issues concerning sound quality in Special Edition's infancy.  \n[/list]\n\nI'm quite happy with this remaster. Of course, modders were able to transform Legendary Edition into a graphical masterpiece that surpasses Special Edition in its current state, but I'm sure that we will be getting plenty of texture mods and ENBs for Special Edition in the coming months and years. For although it may not seem like it at first, Special Edition is vastly superior to Legendary in many ways and beckons as the new, superior foundation upon which modders can build. No mod can make Legendary 64-bit. No mod can truly get rid of Legendary's flickering mountains and screen-tearing. \nI'm proud of what Bethesda has done. They've made their best Elder Scrolls game even better, giving us a taste of the quality and technology that we will be seeing in their next game many years from now.

A bold statement, I'm well aware. But this game does [i]so[/i] many things right that it's really hard not to be impressed with it. And let's be honest: this is a game which is now 7 years old and it's still going strong. Surely that means something....\n\nSo why do I think this game is so immensely superior within the field of RPG's?\n\n[h1]No enforced gameplay[/h1]\n\nNo, I'm not talking about the open world here. If you played RPG's before you'll be familiar with the starting process: design your character, name it, choose things such as race and gender and then...  choose what they should \"be\" and set up their stats accordingly. A warrior will need strength and stamina, a magician or wizard will need intelligence and a thief would need dexterity. All nice and well, but what if you don't know what you want to play as?\n\nI think many of us have been here before: you chose to be a warrior because of its general stats and it might make the game easier to get into. And then you learn about all those cool spells but.... not for you! Your warrior character is too dumb so you don't get to have any fun. Maybe you could use one of your followers? Basically you had to set up some stats and those then determine your gameplay. But since you didn't know the gameplay up front you may end up disappointed. Time to start over?\n\nThat works a [b]little[/b] bit different in Skyrim: your stats don't control your gameplay, but your gameplay determines your stats.\n\nMeaning: if you wield a sword for a long period of time you'll gain more experience with one handed fighting, which is a specific skill. Managed to block and bash your way through enemies using a shield? Then you'll gain more blocking experience. Magic? Sure, you won't be able to cast high end spells \"just like that\" but some low level spells, maybe from a spellbook? No problem. And you guessed it: this would raise your spellcasting abilities (there's more to magic than that, but for the sake of a simple review let's stick with this for now).\n\nSo during an upgrade you will get to spend one (or more) [i]skill points[/i]. You can use those to enhance some of the skills you've been using. Remember me mentioning blocking? If you gained enough XP you might be able to increase your skill which would result in your shield blocking more damage than before. That sword you were wielding? With enough one handed experience you can unlock more options, like one which will make your attacks inflict more damage. You don't obtain special skills from boring numbers, you gain them from actually doing things which will account for training.\n\nAnd this applies to almost everything. From shooting a bow to sneaking. From casting magic spells to stealing. Even skills such as smithing (make your own weapons and armor), speech (bartering) and enchanting. Just play the game as you [i]want[/i] to play and your experience (and expertise) will grow which will unlock more cool abilities. A warrior who knows how to shoot a bow and cast some powerful spells? Not a problem.\n\n[h1]No \"reward paradox\"![/h1]\n\nThis is not official terminology so allow me to explain...  When you first start you obviously don't have the best gear in the game. Your armor is probably average at best and same applies to your weapons. So how do we get better gear to enhance our gameplay? Simple: you need to do missions which will obviously reward you and you can use those rewards to get better stuff. Heck: you may even find good stuff during such a mission.\n\nBut there's also the problem: the reason we want some better stuff is to get a better chance with those missions. But you need to do missions before you get better stuff. But we want better stuff to do the missions, which you only get after doing a mission. As such: a paradox of some sort.\n\nYou probably guessed it: Skyrim doesn't work that way. So you learn about this dungeon which should contain some solid information about the recent dragon attacks. This is the mission you'd undertake to get some good rewards. But what if we want better stuff first? Simple: there's a mine nearby Riverwood. If you looked around Whiterun and talked to some folks then you probably been taught how to craft and enhance weapons and armor. So why not ignore the mission for now and instead hop over to that mine and see if you can dig up some metal ores? You should be able to use those in the forge you already know about and then use all that stuff to craft (or enhance) your current gear.\n\nSo by undertaking such an effort you're basically doing an (unofficial!) mission. One which will bring its own share of rewards and discoveries. Of course you're not doing an official quest: you're only trying to make things easier on yourself :)\n\nIt's not only about freedom in the sense of an open world, but even with the missions and their rewards. Most open world games don't do this: they [i]only[/i] unlock stuff after certain missions. Well, not Skyrim! Fun fact: you could even ignore the main quest entirely and solely focus on making your character much better at first.\n\n[h1]There is some logic applied to the enemies you meet![/h1]\n\nDuring your first walk to Riverwood, and later Whiterun, you'll come across some native animals. It varies of course but I'm sure you're going to encounter a wolf and/or a crab. At this point in the game they may even give you a hard time. So what would happen if you leveled up and have become much stronger? Do the wolves suddenly get replaced by alpha wolves or something weird?\n\nNope!  And I think it's brilliant and [i]really[/i] makes sense!  So: if you go to this area later on in the game and come across these animals you may get attacked by them again. Only this time they won't be a match for your power and skills, some may even be slain in one hit.\n\nThis is [u]so[/u] much better than those games which raise the difficulty of your enemies no matter what.\n\nWhy? Think about it: how would a small village such as Riverwood be able to exist if it were surrounded by monsters which only (very) high skilled warriors could defeat? You probably know the Riverwood trader (and if not: the town has a trader, you should look him up sometime). But how is he going to get his supplies when only the strongest of warriors would be able to pass through the surrounding woods? Wouldn't it be fair to say that if you had those kind of beasts surrounding your town then everyone with a bit of common sense would steer clear from the whole area as best as they can? So much for trading!\n\nSo if the local trader doesn't have anything to trade, then where are the town folks going to get their food from? Whiterun you say? How? Surely a simple townsman won't be able to survive the woods anymore, and surely the Jarl won't sent out his best detachments only to guard a trading convoy?\n\nSkyrim has a sense of realism. And I think it's really good for the gameplay.\n\n[h1]Summing up[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*] Truly open world gameplay: you decide what to do and when to do it.\n[*] Total freedom: your stats don't determine your skills, your actions do.\n[*] Total roleplay: just because you started doing evil stuff doesn't mean that the only things you manage to say are also only evil from here on.\n[*] Beautiful sceneries and environment.\n[/list]\n\nThere are also some cons... I don't necessarily like the default graphics for the player characters (my elven maiden looked like a hag at first :( ) and there are some nasty and weird bugs in the game. But that's what mods are for. And no: you can pick up plenty of mods totally free of charge. Straight from the main menu! No need to pay.\n\nI would also have mentioned the awesome DLC but it seems my review is getting too long ;)\n\nSo here you have it, I highly recommend this game.

If you are a modder or would like to be then Skyrim SE is a must have.\n\n-Graphics is NOT the reason to play Skyrim SE because they didn't redo the graphics (details below).\n-I understand WHY the gaming community is so jaded about this release. Given how AAA games are sold these days combined with the poor decision to focus marketing on \"upgraded graphics\" it's predictable there will be many negative reviews.\n-Cash grab? These are COMPANIES. No income = no company. Simple. Yet consider the release: Free for previous owners. Mod access for consoles. No microtransactions. No pre-paid DLC... No underhanded practices to indicate this is a \"cash grab\" in any way. Beth.net has been around since FO4. Why complain now? It's irrelevant. PC gamers can mod without it.\n-New graphics? The API was upgraded to DX11, texture compression was updated to a newer format and the water was redone.

The old 32-bit Skyrim can't handle complex mods very well. Many would break your saves. Crashes were common. Stability is the modders enemy so to speak.\n-64-bit stability is rock solid. Potential for modding is exponential compared to the original.\n\nSkyrim is my all time favorite game with over 1,000 hours logged using +250 mods but I'm realistic.

However, I feel that those users are purely giving a review on the company itself, rather than the actual game. But, I do understand where those people are coming from. Still, instead of only ranting how evil bethesda is, I will discuss what the positives are about this particular edition of skyrim... and also some of the negatives that come with this game. Don't worry, there aren't too many negatives to discuss, but they still need to be kept in mind before considering getting this game. (I'll be addressing the original game as \u201coldrim\u201d and the special edition, as sse. Just to clear any confusion).\n\nI'll start with the biggest positive. We all know that most of us like modding skyrim, and some of us like modding it to hell, to the point of becoming a hell in of itself. This game uses a 64 bit engine that is a major step up from oldrim's 32 bit engine. This means that the game will not only be way more stable in terms of modding capabilities, but it's also way less prone to randomly crashing like oldrim has. This also means that the game is way better optimized and you'll likely get more frames in sse than in oldrim (granted you aren't playing on a toaster). So now you'll be able to go more all out with modding, without having to worry much about upsetting precious skyrim. (The numerous times I've crashed with oldrim... still gives me nightmares).\n\nAs for the visuals... the game does look slightly better, but not by much. One visual improvement I do like however, are the improved shadows. The old blocky, pixelated shadows from oldrim are now gone. Even shadows on low, look better than that of the original game. Also the addition of a default dof effect was a pretty nice addition imo. There aren't many things to be said about the visuals, except that they look slightly better than oldrim. You get godrays and some other not so good looking visual effects... (snow shader), but of course you can easily tweak everything to your liking. \n\nAside from the silly talk about graphics in skyrim, I'll get down to what exactly are the negatives that come with sse. On July 11th 2017, bethesda announced the creation club, which introduced the option to purchase custom creations that come off as paid mods to many. But, the reality behind the creation club. Is that bethesda forcefully implemented the option to purchase glorified micro-transactions disguised as \u201cmini dlcs\u201d or \u201cpaid mods\u201d into a single player game. Albeit not in the traditional sense. Why exactly is this considered a negative? Well, not only did it forcefully implement a small store to buy these paid creations within sse, but it also introduced a number of problems for the modding capabilities of the game. \n\nWhy is this a problem for modding exactly? Well, certain complex mods depend on something called skse64, which is a script extender tool that further expands the modding capabilities for the game. It basically allows for more awesome and complex mods to be made possible, while also allowing crucial bug fixing mods to function as well. So the creation club is having a negative impact on the functionality of skse64, because every time the creation club updates. It causes skse64 to stop functioning and this would also make certain mods that depend on skse64, to stop working. (Only until skse64 and certain skse64 dependent mods, update to the current updated version of sse). \n\nThere are numerous reasons why the creation club can be considered problematic. But, the worst thing about the creation club, was enforcing these custom creations into a single player game. While making the modding experience tedious on the modders and also on users who just wanted to mod their game in peace. At one point the creation club was actually taking up hard drive space, even if you didn't have any creation club mods installed, fortunately bethesda fixed that mishap.\n\nThese were the main reasons why it took me so long to get into sse, despite getting it for free for owning oldrim and all it's dlc's. Bethesda even went so far as to introduce a \u201cspam box\u201d notification in the main menu advertising the creation club. Just to hammer it down more on our heads. In all honesty, I wouldn't have had any problems with the creation club, if it wasn't getting in the way of modding sse, due to the game updating too much for the creation club. Also if the creation club had actual content that is on par with certain pre existing mods that is actually worth paying for. \n\nEverything in the creation club is either very overpriced or a mere shadow of an already existing mod (survival mode). Let me be clear, I am not condemning anyone who wants to use the creation club. In my opinion, I feel it should be something left out of sse, but realistically that's not going to happen. Bethesda should have at least implemented it better or have the creation club be completely separate from the game itself, without making it a nuisance for some. (but who am I kidding). \n\nAside from that obvious elephant in the room. There are also some other slight negatives left to discuss about this particular edition of skyrim. One of the issues with sse, is that it still retains all the bugs from oldrim. Bethesda has been focused on skyrim for a long time, while re-releasing it numerous times now and is of course one of their best selling games of all time. So why they didn't even bother to put in the effort to iron out all the remaining, numerous gameplay bugs the game has is just odd. Despite being many reports online detailing these said bugs. I know most people would say: \"It's because the modders do all the work for them\" as there are mods available to fix those issues. But, shouldn't bethesda be the one to fix these gameplay/quest bugs? Maybe, maybe not, but it is still a negative nonetheless. \n\nThe last negative I'll discuss, is the price itself. Price wise the game is too expensive. I know this includes all the dlc's and is a major improvement in terms of stability, still a game this old shouldn't be priced normally at $39.99, default price should be preferably $19.99. Especially when you consider how bethesda has forcefully implemented paid creations within sse, while also conveniently hiding the oldrim store page from steam search, as well as disabling sales for that game. Which is also another negative, but more so on bethesda themselves.\n\nSo overall... why am I still recommending this game? Well, it's because it is the most stable and optimized version yet, but also because there are many mods to get around some of the issues I presented within this review. Such as visuals, bugs, and even the creation club... to an extent [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12679]No More Creation Club News[/url] \n\nDespite these negatives, I can't deny that sse is the most stable and optimized version yet, although hindered by the creation club. If it weren't for the high price, the creation club, bethesda hiding original skyrim and disabling sales for it, this version of skyrim would have been received much better.\n\nI'll close this shoddy review by noting that sse still has a lot of mod support and more than enough mods to justify making an upgrade from oldrim to sse, (if you so choose). It goes without saying that oldrim has way more mods by comparison (oldrim came out in 2011) However, sse is much more stable and optimized, but either way, pick however you like your poison. Just keep in mind the expensive cost of this game and wait for a sale on a reasonable price. As for the creation club... all I can suggest for users who use certain skse64 dependent mods, stick with a specific version. Unless if you want to keep endlessly updating till bethesda retires the creation club, which doesn't seem very likely at this point.\n\nHopefully my review has helped somewhat.

It no longer puts your mouse pointer on-screen after an Alt-Tab (like in the original Skyrim), resulting in fewer restarts and less annoyance.\n\n-Updated to 64bit, much more stable in general and a boon to mods in the long run.\n\n-Rain and snow now don't pass through rocks and other scenery, increasing a bit of immersion and making the terrain feel more \"real\".\n\n-Added God Rays, forrests look much prettier now.\n\n-Depth of field, can be a little annoying in open areas, but makes conversations with NPC's a look lot nicer.\n\n-Sleek black new launcher, removed the 'Data Files' option and moved it to the main menu.\n\n-Slightly better looking bethesda logo on startup.\n\n-The poor sound quality was fixed in a patch, the music sounds the same as the original Skyrim (which is in this case, a good thing).\n\n\nSo, do I recommend it? \n\nIf you have never played/owned a version of skyrim before, there is no reason not to buy it. It's cheaper ($5 for all the DLC's) and is more stable.\n\nIf you own Skyrim and all the DLC's, there is not much reason to buy this for full price - wait for a sale if you want it (unless money isn't a big deal to you, in that case, buy away!).\n\nIf you own the original Skyrim but with no DLC's, then I reccomend it because it is cheaper than buying all the DLC's for it.\n\nThank you for reading my review!

Players are free to join any group except there is a choice between Imperials of Solitude and the Stormcloaks as their opposite ideologies lead to different endings in context of the campaign.\n\n[h1]Graphics and Music[/h1]\nThe graphics and music of the tilte is quite good keeping in mind the game's been around since 2011.Further enhancements can be done through installing proper mods.The visuals in vanilla itself are quite marvelous and the music doesn't irritate even after hours of continuous play.\n\n[h1]Drawbacks[/h1]\nThis great game has some flaws too.\n[list]\n  [*]Rewards are mostly underpaid with respect to the enemy infested quests.\n  [*]Horses are poorly designed,they are slow and can stangely climb even wall like standing flat mountains.\n  [*]Heavy modding makes the game crash prone.\n  [*]The transition from a beginner to a guild master is too quick,more quests would have been better.\n  [*]I personally feel there is a lack of driving force which would make the dragonborn do what he does.Why would someone perform such heroic deeds by just knowing about the ability to absorb dragons.\n[/list]\n\n[u]Apart from these rest of the review highlights are the pros[/u]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIn all i would write this,anyone who could play through the first 5 hours of the game will surely love it and continue the journey of the Dovahkiin.I hope this review helps the reader and i know some of it might be wrong and incomplete,so feel free to rectify.I would appreciate that.Thanks for reading.\n\n[b]Please note[/b]:[i]This review is written after playing 98 hours of moddless gameplay.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1530178697, "timestamp_updated": 1530179724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 93, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.837877392768859863", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39136854": {"recommendationid": "39136854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083794848", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 17688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1537974765}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]My experience with this [b]G O D L Y[/b] game.[/h1]\n1.

Better than Fallout 4 in terms of quests. Skyrim actually has some interesting side quests unlike Fallout 4 MMO style, and even less of them, radiant just makes it look like there is more, but it's not the case. \n\nGameplay is nice, variety of combat styles, mix and match. I enjoy magic gameplay the most, then the stealth, assassin type build. The level up system is pretty dull, level up skills as you play, sounds good, but it can get boring at higher levels. Some perks are okay, but i like the look of the perk menu.\n\nAtmosphere, exploring the open world of Skyrim, combined with the good soundtracks, makes it feel really great. If you're big into role-playing, can get really immersed.\n\nDLC's are great. What's more badass than fighting another Dragonborn. DLC itself adds a new location of Solstheim, brings back the Morrowind feels \u2764. New weapons, armor, the badass Dragon Aspect shout, such that. Dawnguard was okay, Serana is a great companion and the Vampire Lord ability is awesome. Hearthfire is just building.\n\nIt's all great. Great game, good DLC's, a lot of content. Then there's the mods!\n\nSpeaking of the Special Edition itself, it does look better, but it's Fallout 4 optimization all over again. Unfortunately, and, unsurprisingly, nothing was fixed by Bethesda, just made it look better and that's it. The great thing is the 64-bit engine. Runs great with a lot of mods, no crashes, and even if Skyrim Legendary has way more mods, Special Edition has a pretty good amount of mods that do the job. Only negative at the moment is the SKSE64 still in Alpha, hopefully it gets fully released sometime, a lot of potential for mods and 64-bit.\n\n\nDue to how Bethesda is doing things now with Skyrim and Fallout 4, I will not recommend this. Game itself is great, but Creation Club is just.... shouldn't exist. They look so stupid saying it's not paid mods when it's just that. The prices are just ridiciolous. Paying for Survival Mode? Are you kidding?. Nexus mods are still there, better, FREE mods.

However, given the fact that I've amassed, in a soft estimate, roughly 800 hours through different versions of this game and so has most likely everyone else. I feel qualified in throwing in my 2 cents in on the matter. \n\nI'll start by stating that I did not receive this game for free as I have never previously played or owned any of the DLC. I did in fact pay $20 for this version.\n\n[h1]Skyrim is fuckin' great.[/h1]\nI feel like it's the popular thing to hate on Skyrim. Either for being dumbed-down from Oblivion or even more so from Morrowind, or because it has so many versions as well as Bethesda just becoming a \u201cvillain\u201d in the industry. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that when we look back at gaming history (I know a lot of people don't really care about the history of gaming, especially because it's quite new from a relative standpoint to other forms of media. But, you should care and you're bad for not caring. :P) Skyrim will go down as one of the greatest games ever made. It'll be right there on the same list as Tetris, Minecraft, Super Mario, Zelda, Quake, Doom and Unreal Tournament. I've left out things like Pong, Pac-man and the Magnavox Odyssey because, while equally important, they are incremental to the further development of games and not necessarily 'the greatest'. However, I feel that simply mentioning them in the same paragraph speaks volumes. \n\n[h1]Creation Club and people getting paid for work.[/h1]\nI'm of two minds when it comes to these things. I don't think there will ever be a way to satisfy everyone. But, I think Besthesda has shaken off the naysayers and implemented a system that benefits most. Participation in the Creation Club is optional. You can still use the script extender, you can still use the nexus and you can still download steam workshop mods directly in the main menu. For FREE. Of course at the bereavement of not being able to get achievements. My god, what a travesty. How will we ever recover at such a price? While I realize you previously could donate or wire tap funds to mod makers. What 'normie' is really going to do that? The Creation Club has given a pathway for those with a dearth of technical knowledge a way to explore mods and provide compensation to those that make them should they choose to. And from this perspective, I simply can find no fault. \n\nI'm not going to bother saying what Skyrim [i]is[/i], as of this point, if you don't know what Skyrim is, I'm willing to bet you're mother is currently gestating. \n\n[i][b]THE GIST\nDo we need a hundred thousand versions of Skyrim? Absolutely not. But, I would say if you currently don't own Skyrim, this version has objectively more content than the version that does not include the Dragonborn, Hearthfire and Dawnguard DLC. And yes, at a base value. This game vanilla is basically the old Skyrim with a few foliage, texture and shader mods. Remasters aren't going anywhere. Especially with the average age of gamer increasing. Your 10 year old self has a bunch of memories your 30 year old self wants to revisit. And devs want to provide that concession.
