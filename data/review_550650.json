Killed the casual players. First, they killed TDM by adding all demolition maps to TDM. Buildings at demolition maps (planting spots) are closer to PM spawn=hiding spots=advantage for Viper. Now they force the best players to play demolition 5v5 for keys, and 8/10 matches are a random casual players' team (K/D 0.8-1.2) vs a company of great players from top clans (K/D 1.8-2+++). Match making is not existent. Result? No fun for casual players. Who likes to get teared apart in every match? Clan matches died because of Competitive squad. 6+ months ago the average waiting time to find a game was up to 10 seconds. Now it's 1.5 minute or more. The players' pool is getting smaller every day. I used to spend money in this game. The last couple of months i sold all my skins that cost more than 2GBP in market and already searching for a new game. A lot of my in-game friends already quit game for the reasons above.

I did notice the the AK rifle was superior in almost every regard, but it was not gamebreaking at all. Basically, every gun is viable and is only determined by the player's skill and play style.\nFor example, I preferred heavy machine guns because they had 100 rounds, shot fast and did high damage. Meanwhile, some players might prefer an SMG because of movement speed and high rate of fire. The point is, there wasn't a balance issue at all and was very well executed. \n\nControlls:\nControlls were smooth and fast paced. If you enjoyed Counter Strike, this game will suite you to an extent. It is slightly faster paced and a bit more chaotic. You can aim down the sight of your gun as well as use the crosshair in the center of the screen. It functioned very closely to COD in a good and clever way.\n\nContent:\nThe game has a lot to offer in terms of content but its also missing valuable assets to make it better. It has your standard Team Deathmatch, Demolition, etc. One thing it certainly lacked was maybe a Free-for-All mode. There were countless times where I was playing with an odd number of friends and forced one of them out just so we can have balanced teams. I feel like these things should be considered. Minor complaint, but thought I would throw it out there.\n\nNow its time to get into the bad stuff and to why I quit this game all-together...\n\nFirst off, the matchmaking is absolutely terrible and an unblanaced mess of crap. The game \"supposed\" to place you in matches of people with similar scores instead of similar ranks. So if you're a private and are really good at the game, you will get matched up with someone who may be a lieutenant and kick your ass. I cant even count how many times I joined games and lost 8-0 because of how awful the matchmaking is. Its been like this since I started playing and the devs still wont do anything to fix it. Instead of balancing the the awful maps and terrible sound design, they would rather fill their pockets with cheap cosmetics and loot boxes. The maps are too large and completely unfair. Players cal literally thow grenades across the maps and land kills everytime. And lets not forget that every gun in the game had a grenade launcher. Which means everyone can spam it and get cheap kills. The sounds aren't loud enough either. My teammate can be right next to me shooting and i wouldn't hear his gun go off. How the hell am I supposed to hear any enemies nearby???\n\nThe point Im trying to make here is that you shouldnt waste your time with this garbage. I already wasted my time with this review. The devs wont listen to the fans and would rather stuff their pockets with money from lootboxes. Thats really it. This game is literally a scam if you put any money into it.

I'll be honest, I wasn't really expecting a lot from this game, that being said, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nLet's address the elephant in the room, that being the cash shop and premium items. Yes, there is premium stuff, no, there is nothing you can buy to give you a stat advantage. The only thing money will buy is a currency called Bullets, which are just skin crates. that's it, so far. It's wayy too early to tell if this will evolve into something more sinister, time will tell on that front.\n\nSince that is out of the way, on to the rest of my unduely long review!\n\n[b]Graphically[/b] this game looks pretty nice, animations are good, the maps follow their own colour palettes, some are brown and grey, some more colourful. Overall map design is all very simple and easy to get a hold of, the maps are easy to learn and navigate.\n\nTextures look good, haven't seen anything blurry or that stands out as weird, the graphical design is all very coherent if not a bit dull. The guns look very nice and tacticool.\n\n[b]Sounds[/b] are good, there are a couple music tracks and they're decent enough, mostly rock\\metal style music, some songs sound a little bit quiter than others but it's nothing major. Gun sounds are everywhere from unique and good sounding to mediocre and bland. The starter pistol sounds like an airsoft gun. However you can generally tell the weapon type being fired pretty easily. Footsteps are loud as hell, making walking a very important tactic to employ since it'll make you completely silent.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] is very reminiscent of Call of Duty meets Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. If you played any of these titles, you'll feel very comfortable in this game. The guns have almost no recoil making assault rifles feel very samey, they mostly are the same aside from varying stats, such as one rifle might do more damage with a slower rate of fire and smaller magazine size, while the other has a much large mag size, and fires faster but has lower damage.\n\nThe available primary weapons are Assault Rifles, SMGs, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, LMGs and Designated Marksman Rifles (DMRs). They're all very straight forward, however shotguns in this game are brutal, they can take someone out with a single shot from quite far away, they have barely noticable recoil, and they fire quickly. Basically, matches, especially in Demolitions, will come down to who has the most KSG shotguns on their team, and who sees who first.\n\nGame modes are fairly straight forward.\n\nYou have good ol' Team Deathmatch which is addictive.\n\nDemolition 8v8 & 5v5 which is identical to DE defuse game modes in CS:GO, minus the buying. \n\nAssassination, where one team defends a VIP (controlled by a brain dead AI, mind you.) that can die in like 4 shots, as he waddles to a helicopter. The other team has to kill the enemy team and the VIP, or kill the VIP and extract from their own helicopter. This mode is very... meh. It's out of place and not fun.\n\nAnd last, but not least, Battle Match, where you have to work with your team to destroy the enemy base, which are giant supply crates or something. This mode is where classes come into play, and it's pretty hectic and clearly the main gamemode. It's okay, it's certainly one of the better modes. The maps for it are quite large as well, which is nice.\n\nThe combat is very, very fast. The time-to-kill in this game is intensely low, and fire-fights rarely last more than a couple seconds. Pretty much every weapon kills in 2 - 1 headshot, in some cases like the shotguns and close range, headshots aren't even needed to take someone out in a split second.\n\nGrenades in this game, unlike CS:GO, are lethal. While easy to avoid, catching one will seriously injure or just outright kill you from full health.\n\nThere is \"sprinting\" in this game, but it's just pulling your knife out ala CS. However the interesting thing here is you have the option to hold a button to take your knife out, and then swap back to the last weapon you had upon button release. It acts like a sort of sprint button, very different feature I've never seen before. Knives themselves are just 1-hit kills if you manage to land a stab, 2 - 3 hits if you just swing it.\n\n[b]In-Game Store[/b] is where you purchase weapons and stuff like that, and I was pleasantly surprised with it. There is really nothing to buy with actual money, and they give you a LOT of cash to start with. You get 215k just for starting and doing the tutorial, guns range from 96k - 192k, and they are permenant, no repairs or anything like that, once you own a gun, you keep it forever and can use it forever. Cash is very easy to earn, you get 15K just for logging in each day, 20K or so for dailies, and around 800 for each match completed.\n\nYou also have weeklies. They award Medals which let you purchase more novelty items, like player cards, side-arms, skins and stuff like that. A Desert Eagle costs 1,500 medals, after only about 15 matches I had a little over 1,000, so it's not hard to obtain.\n\nOverall, the store is quite nice, the menus are a bit hard to navigate, though. It remains to be seen if this game will turn P2W, only time will tell.\n\n[b]Community[/b] ohhhh boy, the community... It's already really bad. Very toxic, a vast majority of the people you play with are actual children, racial slurs, hostility at the slightist provocation, you name it, this community has it. I highly suggest not interacting with the people in this game, for your own sanity, and the safety of your braincells.\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b] It's very nice if not a little graphically bland, it's a very small game (only 4.3 gigs) and doesn't require a sign up, the combat is pretty intense and fun, it runs fairly smooth, no pay-to-win as of yet, no timed guns or BS like that, the guns are easy to earn, the gamemodes are alright, but the community is incredibly immature.", "timestamp_created": 1501467965, "timestamp_updated": 1501467965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 278, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.922000348567962646", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "47530910": {"recommendationid": "47530910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188798830", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546368262}, "language": "english", "review": "---{Graphics}---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 Paint.exe\n\n---{Gameplay}---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 It\u2018s just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Starring at walls is better\n\u2610 Just don\u2018t\n\n---{Audio}---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Earrape\n\n---{Audience}---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Teens\n\u2610 Adults\n\u2611 Human\n\n---{PC Requirements}---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boiiiiii\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Difficulity}---\n\u2610 Just press \u201aA\u2018\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2611 Isnt necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You\u2018ll need a second live for grinding\n\n---{Story}---\n\u2611 Story?\n\u2610 Text or Audio floating around\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovley\n\u2610 It\u2018ll replace your life\n\n---{Game Time}---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{Price}---\n\u2611 It\u2019s free!\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{Bugs}---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\nAmazing Game.", "timestamp_created": 1544820093, "timestamp_updated": 1544820143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 256, "votes_funny": 110, "weighted_vote_score": "0.89026188850402832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "48213570": {"recommendationid": "48213570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284426410", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 49313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 52, "last_played": 1550987810}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a very good FPS, but i started to think the devs acidentaly made a good game bcuz they have the worst support ever, now they don't fix the game, is only skins, skins and skins every update.

NA scene is all but dead and servers have degraded to an almost unplayable point. Pretty sure BattleEye is not working or even on anymore they probably stopped paying for it since it's expensive and they clearly don't give a shit about this game. I would need to see some serious evidence to show BE is actually implemented and working because when I do occasionally hop on there are pretty blatant togglers/wallers going on. Neowiz Paid streamers to play the game but continue to ignore their already existing streamer base who been at it since day 1. They did finally add a section on discord that tells you when partners are streaming but it's in an obscure location with no notifcation so unless you scroll all the way down to see it you'll never know it's there. Meanwhile if any staff go live on their \"personal channels\" that have nothing to do with the game theyll tweet that shit out and spam it all over partner/official disord in everyones face. \n\nI highly advice anybody looking into this game to stay away. Neowiz has made their intention as a company clear and BTW this game has been dead on Korea since 2016. They had a 4 month contract to broadcast the competitive matches but it died out because no one gave a shit about it. This game is as DEAD on Korea server as it is NA. Just brought this up because seen lot misinformed people talking about how this games a Esport in korea. IT was for 4 months.. 2 years ago and their game has drastically different mechanics than our which include weapon tagging that we don't have. Any streamers who got contacted about streaming this game please actually research the kind of shit you're advertising and read.\n\n\n\nSubject to change.\n\nSo after 300+ hours decided to finally do a review. Also keep in mind most of the positive reviews are people with Sub 3 hours play time. That's like... 5-6 Games and some menu camping. Also lot of the higher hour reviews are done by the developers and Moderators trying to fluff their own reviews... Atleast change your names and try to hide it's you.. NOTLIKETHIS.\n\npositives:\n-Free\n-Will have steam market integration soon hopefully so I can sell my skins and get my money back for wasting so much time with this game.\n-Has potential to be a great game.\n-Great for Casual players who don't want a game with high learning curve like CS or OW\n\nNegatives:\n-Korean company that almost tanked after ruining the original game in korea farming money with this version\n-Early access despite Korean version being out for 2 years so just another excuse to deliver half finished product and slowly milk money out of us\n-Competitive scene is 5% known cheaters 94% failed rejects who couldn't make it outa ESEA open who quit CSGO/Siege/OW to be mediocre in this low skill ceiling FPS. 1% are actually good solid players but they know better then to take this game overly seriously.\n-QM has no rating system and half time you're 1v5ing. Solo players get qued into full 5 stacks pretty much on regular\n-Game has progressively gotten worse with every update and last 2-3 updates were nothing but Skins/Gun additions/Cash Box changes. While the servers get worse and worse and NA server is riddled with Asian players despite them having their own server\n-Ping... so the netcode in the game caters to high ping compensation allowing people with 80+ ping to have a peeker advantage over everyone else. This is why the Asian community feels its necessary to play on the NA servers despite having 300+ ping because it allows them to basically see you first and shoot you first through walls and other objects not to mention they teleport across your screen and damage dump you. Developers seem to be at an impossible junction where if they Region lock QM servers they lose a majority of their games playerbase which is Asia by all accounts.\n-Game was more competitive and Esport ready in the early beta phases and has progressively become more and more casual with the removal of recoil patterns and Tagging. Skill ceiling for the game is extremely low which is why there are so many self proclaimed \"pros\" in the game atm who are C- 8 RWS career ESEA players in a real game called Counter strike.\n-Tactical depth to the game is severely lacking as the Maps designs are some of the worse I've ever seen. Questioning whether the map designer for this product has even played a competitive shooter before. Smokes and Flashbangs have limited use making the majority of the game 1:1 Aim duels. Meaning the compeitive potential for this game is extremely low and most likely will get boring and old after a 2-3 month binge then die out.\n-Community managers dick ride established well known streamers and content producers who play the game for maybe 1 day then never touch it again. They also dick rode a team of known Cheaters who cheated people out of cup wins for almost a month and were given free items only to later be banned by Battle Eye *FacePalm*. Let's not even start at the unprofessional weekly twitch stream they do where they spend 60% of the stream shit talking negative reviews on the steam page.\n-Instead of taking feedback from the higher level competitive players they continue to just do random game changes that make 0 sense like removing Tagging from all the guns in the game during the Closed beta and making 80% of the guns laser beams. \n-Early Cash boxes were extremely rigged and later the developers even admitted to it and slowly began increasing rewards drastically from the boxes but failed to compensate any of the early box openers who spent money basically screwing over a large majority of the community.\n-30 tick rate servers... Word is the new competitive channel will have higher tick rate and be better overall servers than whats currently been given to us but every patch the servers get worse and worse and I've even teleported randomly with 20 ping before. Not sure if this is related to the extra strain the server goes through to host all the 300+ ping players who still haven't been locked out of the server they dont belong in yet.\n-Community expresses how much it hates SMG and how they ruin the game and Developers respond by adding another SMG into the game a week later and actually somehow messing up a patch that was literally 95% skins + 1 gun and the gun had old coding from closed beta where tagging was still implemented.\n\nOverall:\nI've invested into the game and hoped for its pontential to shine through. Things started off great but it's becomming more and more clear that the priority for Neowiz is the Korean version. This is just a cash grab in order to get the Korean version pumping again. How Steam can allow them to market this as Early access when all the content is already created and existing in the Korean version that has existed for over 2 years is beyond me. The games skill celing is low and to be honest most of the actual good players have already quit. The only people who are gonna continue to grind this game are going to be the casual players and the low skill players who find success here because of the low skill ceiling. Most of the predictions I made about this game have come true. Playerbase is slowly decreasing more and more everyday and I don't see this Game making it past January with any more than 3-4k players which is a 70% decrease from what it started with. By the time the game maybe becomes competitive ready and starts actually hosting competitive leagues and tournaments with proper Anti cheat and prize money it'll most likely be too late and this'll just become another AVA or SF2 and have a very small dedicated competitive scene of slightly above average players who seem to flock to these f2p shooters like flies to a steamy pile of dogshit.", "timestamp_created": 1506110915, "timestamp_updated": 1528723209, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 543, "votes_funny": 44, "weighted_vote_score": "0.850914418697357178", "comment_count": 29, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36473231": {"recommendationid": "36473231", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175703490", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 13853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1542534321}, "language": "english", "review": "best $0.00 i ever spent", "timestamp_created": 1510502379, "timestamp_updated": 1510502379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 152, "votes_funny": 235, "weighted_vote_score": "0.821601033210754395", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "43222915": {"recommendationid": "43222915", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119546608", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 3865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1541215146}, "language": "english", "review": "I started playing this game as a joke mainly, just something to f u c k around in where I don't have to deal with the stress that competitive modes in games such as CS:GO deliver.

It is in no way pay to win either, which makes it all the better. Every gun in the game can be acquired permanently without having to pay a dime, just by playing the game. This game is practically a mix of CoD and CS:GO. While it doesn't offer anything new to the table, it does its job well enough to warrant players to keep coming back for it's simple mechanics and fun combat.

That mode takes forever to get into a game.\n*Map design isn't great. Typically one sided. TOO SMALL leads to spawn camping.\n*Guns are either worthless or to similar. AK=GOD and nothing else. \n*To many people take advantage of their bad ping. Makes for a poor experience. \n\n\nBlack Squad is the wet dream of an early 2000's male teen. It takes CS:Go and CoD shoves them together and attempts to be something slightly newer, but falls a little short. \n\nYou will start your career in the Black Squad by going through a tutorial. Of course there are the modern tutorial cliches, \"LMB to Fire, W,A,S,D to move,\" etcetera. It isn't until later in the brief tutorial that you learn about your Perks and how to use them. That right there is the only important information found in the tutorial. It will leave you wondering why the game even needed a CoD-esque cinematic tutorial? It would have sufficed to just run you through it within a minute. \n\nAfter that you'll start playing the actual game. Like most players you'll most likely jump into TDM. At which point you'll be wondering, \"Where are the perks?\" Then after a few games you'll think to yourself, \"Well why the f*** did it tell me about this if they aren't even here?\" Well that's because they are in the Battle Match gamemode and not TDM. So they thought far enough to tell you how to use something, but neglected to tell you it is only a feature in one gamemode.\n\nThat gamemode btw, will typically take you anywhere from 30 seconds to 10 minutes to get into. Just prepare yourself now for longer wait times. Battle Match pits 16 players against another 16 in a \"Destroy the objectives\" style game. Both teams have crates with life labeled A-E on the map. It is your goal to damage and destroy the enemies while protecting yours. Only problem with this is the general map design. \n\nIn Battle Match the maps are slightly big enough to fit all of the objectives, but not big enough that you can't run to your opponents spawn in 10 seconds. Poor Map design is a clear pattern in Black Squad. Some maps are 100% symmetrical to each other while others take liberties and attempt to make a more unique map. The maps that aren't symmetrical will almost always have a \"better side.\" Explicitly VBSS, Dock Night, and Revenge all have an advantageous side to their respective map. \n\nWeapons also feel lacking. I've yet to find an exact reason on why I shouldn't use the starter weapons, as every other weapon I've used seems to be outclassed by them, other than maybe the AK (we'll get to it in a bit,) and snipers. Any rifle other than the TAR seem vastly the same, or slightly less than. Both shotguns, the KSG and M1014 are 100% worthless, lack the ability to do bonus headshot damage like every other weapon, and take longer to kill than your basic pistol. Many rifles in the game feel the same recoil wise and their stats are not noticeably different. Marksman Rifles (DMRs) are worthless as well. They have two different sights, but lack the ability to change from single fire to burst or FA. Hell sights don't matter because hipfire has the same accuracy. LMGs are just rifles with bad accuracy and recoil, but hey at least you dont have to reload. \n\nThen theres the AK. IT IS GOD. Its bullet spread has killed my friend and I in a OSK more times than I can count. If someone has an AK on the other team, you're helmet has a magnet on it. Be prepared to hate this weapon with all of your might. \n\nThat AK is going to kill you while you're behind a wall, a box, in spawn doesnt matter. Why? Becuase you will find yourself up against players with 150 ms, 200ms, heck I played against someone with 800+ms ping the other day. You will see a lot of players with high pings, which only makes your experience worse. Especially when its a headshot behind that wall. BS really needs to setup ping limits if it wants to be taken serious.\n\nOther than the crappy map design, bad netcode and the true lack of defining gun characteristics the game isn't bad for a F2P. I find it fun and challenging, but it could be better. I really wish there was a mixed option for reccomending because that is how I feel.

Better than a lot of paid games I've played! Great in-game ecomony, great and competitive gameplay and the customization is just done right! Not pay-to-win at all, it's play-to-win! Do recommend![/h1]\n\n[h1] The game [/h1]\nThe game is very balanced and rewards progress, I enjoy the maps, the game and everything surrounding it feels very complete. There is only a small learning curve, and skill is definitely rewarded, but you are placed with people of similar skill, so not to worry! The mechanics feel great and it just feels like everything is done right.. There are some similar elements to other games, but not in a way such that it feels like a rip-off. In fact, the game has some very effective and creative solutions which I applaud them for. I have had a lot of fun, and some very intense moments in this first person shooter, and I continue to have fun with it almost every match! (and I consider myself pretty picky)\nDefinitely a game that I would recommend! Good for beginners as well as FPS veterans. Great value for money! (hehe, it's free!)\n\n\n[h1] Performance [/h1]\nThe game is easy to run even though it looks very good. I tried it out with my old, slow laptop (i5 4300U, Intel HD graphics, which, comparing to desktop processors, is worse than the Pentium G3320 (basically the cheapest, slowest pentium processor from 2013..) And even still, on this laptop, it was very playable, with varying framerate. Between 40 and 60 fps, usually 50-60 fps, on minimal settings of course. 40fps was pretty uncommon and I've never seen it dip below 30fps during my brief testing. Potato PC approved \u2713. On higher settings, it looks great, and it being able to run on lower-end devices is a great feature. And the faster pc's get a great looking game, too! (with ambient occlussion, shadows and whatnot)\n\n\n[h1] Community [/h1] (as of 29/05/2018)\nThe community is alright, usually the chat isn't used actively, and a voice-chat system is lacking.  But there is a radio message system, comparable to CS:GO to kind of make up for it.. Weird thing is when you're spectating, no one, even your teammates (that are alive) can see it. This causes some of the silence I believe. I've made some in-game friends already, but what is lacking is a way to add them on steam, the in-game friends tab is a bit poor to use as it is. I would appreciate a button, like I've seen on some other games, to be redirected to a players' steam profile. As it stands now, I have to tell them my steam ID in the in-game chat or lobby. Yuck :/.\n\nFunny thing; when you spawn, you're missing one bullet from your magazine. I'm not sure if this is intentional, but it's kind of this cool and unique thing of Black Squad to hear  evereyone's character shout 'Reloading!' in the beginning of a round.\n\n\n\n[i](disclaimer, I'm pretty new and don't fully understand the whole 'conomy)[/i]\n[h1]More about the economy\nTLDR: You can earn all available weapons without paying a dime. You can unlock every one of them, money only buys you cosmetics. [/h1]\nYou earn in-game currency by finishing matches (discourages leaving prematurely), leveling up, signing in (every day) etc. etc. You can buy different knives with earned currency rather easily. There's some cool skins on the knives that are quite expensive (paid currency). You do get a chance at having them for free, buy a random box thing with in-game currency, that has the option to reward you a paid-currency knife! (Much like CS:GO boxes) for not a lot of in-game currency either! Along with skins and knives you can also buy character-skins, which changes your appearance in-game. Notably to a girl which a lot of players seem to do. This is also paid. Customization of classes (which weapons you want to use, etc.) seems a bit daunting at first and I got the hang of it rather quickly. \n\nI was able to buy myself a karambit knife pretty quickly and I'm loving it so far. There's a lot of weapoons to choose from for very little in-game currency (that you earn).\n\nBasically, there's two free currencies; Gold and medals. With these you can buy weapons and accessories (grenades, etc). \n- Gold you gain easily for playing matches and often get rewarded these for signing in or whatever.There are 20 weapons you can buy with this. 19 primary weapons and 1 secondary weapon.\n- Medals, you get these for leveling up and such. A bit rarer, you can buy 16 Primary weapons with this and 4 secondary weapons. With the medals you can also get 6 knives.\nI think they've made the free aspect of this game great, you don't feel left out.\n\n[Update: You can get one of the paid, or should I say 'premium' currencies for free! BS Coin it's called and with these you can buy skins! I have received 100 BS earlier and just now 500 BS coin, skins are priced either 500 BS coin or 20.000, so as a free player I am free to choose a skin of my liking, this is awesome! I have just bought some bullets as well, the paid-only currency you use to gamble for skins/BS coin using random boxes.]\n\n[h1]My opinion on the bad feedback[/h1]\n- Do I think the graphics are bad? No, not at all! I find myself admiring the scene sometimes, like I do in AAA games. (it's not perfect, but impressive either way and well-optimized!)\n- Do I think the maps are small? No, not at all. \n- Is it pay-to-win? No, not at all. (I would like to hear the argumentation for this one)\n- Servers bad? No not at all. I have pretty good ping on any game, sure. But I've never encountered network lag on this game, and I find matches very quickly (usually within 20 seconds, demolition). \n- You [b]can[/b] run in this game, you do it by holding the knife instead of the primary weapon (switch to it or press middle mouse button to automatically return to your primary when releasing it)\n- I think there's plenty of customazation, what I really like is that there's no weapons that overpowered. I feel it's very balanced and you get to choose depending on your playstyle, not what's good and what's bad.\n\nI see many people criticizing the game in a negative-only type of way. Many of these have barely played the game for an hour.. It's Early Acces, if you have a suggestion to make, tell the dev's. Don't hate on 'em for making a game that's finally good. I much dislike the direction that CoD and EA are taking. Pay full price for a game only to enter a world of DLC.\nI've started disliking some of the elements in CS:GO. Having 1000+ hours played on it, I can assure you this game is not a CS:GO rip-off. Is it better than CS:GO? I can't tell you. But when I find myself bored, I hit up Black Squad, not CS:GO.\n\n[u] The good feedback on this game is definitely deserved, I hope to play many more hours in this awesome game! Definitely try out demilition 5v5![/u]\n\n[h1]In short; I love the game, and it's only 5GB in size, so what are you waiting for? :D[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1527690687, "timestamp_updated": 1528392070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 81, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.811179220676422119", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "48064490": {"recommendationid": "48064490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056458607", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 33002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 86, "last_played": 1551864553}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game worst support FULL OF HACKERS and the supports help them by leaving them and give them protection I reported so many of them and they let them play and they will always say =we need a video proof with some 3rd party software=no matter how many times I explaine a video from my point of view will show nothing we need a embaded game replay system that show how those hackers headshot us blindly and show the aim is automatic always on our head\n\nI will give this review a NO", "timestamp_created": 1546507394, "timestamp_updated": 1546507394, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.766174197196960449", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "41893721": {"recommendationid": "41893721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138110405", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550346268}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, that's what happens when you take CrossFire and add to it a little bit of Call of Duty mechanix, and that's a damn great work!", "timestamp_created": 1525635400, "timestamp_updated": 1527269475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.780911743640899658", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33891738": {"recommendationid": "33891738", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083777142", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549060505}, "language": "english", "review": "-Starts game\n-Does Tutorial\n-Ok\n-Sees in-game money\n-200k ok i guess guns are 400k-600k\n-Guns 80k-192k\n-WAT!?\n-Buys 2 super good guns who already have everything on them (scope,grenade launcher)\n-Didnt have  to play the game to get good guns have them already at lvl 1\n-Still have 30K left \n-Everyday by just playing 15k in-game money\n-Ok\n-Easy 10/10\n\n\n\nAfter checking shit out i can assure u EVERYTHING AND I MEAN EVERYTHING \n\"cough\" except skins \"cough\" CAN BE BOUGHT WHIT IN-GAME Money", "timestamp_created": 1501367766, "timestamp_updated": 1501862783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 319, "votes_funny": 75, "weighted_vote_score": "0.824770867824554443", "comment_count": 22, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "45372398": {"recommendationid": "45372398", "author": {"steamid": "76561198850008925", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1544209617}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool game.

I discovered Black Squad years ago and was thrilled to see that it finally will be released on the European market. \n\nI played the Alpha and both Closed Beta Versions and so far I have to give props to the developers for doing such a great work. Very good communication with the Community thanks to the Medics/Neobricks. The major things that the community mentions are getting implemented, it takes some time but the game seems to be going in a good way. \n\n[b]My personal PRO's:[/b]\n- NO PAY TO WIN, real money will only give you skins. No super special high damage low recoil weapons, just skins. \n- BattlEye as Anti-Cheat. If anyone of you played Skill Special Force 2 you may know the pain. Every second game at least one Cheater and no improvement in sight. Since BattlEye is one of the best AC currently on the market I'm glad to see it supports Black Squad. \n- Variety, for an Early Access there is already a good amount of variety. No matter if it's Guns, Game Modes or Maps! \n- Free DLC's with plenty of guns\n- Crosshair Customisation for free (*cough* not like Sf2 where you have to pay for it *cough*) \n\nUpdate November 2018: We have e-Sports baby, ESL is available since some time now, starting with the Go4 Cup and a Demolition Cup. They will have a Tournament/Major Cup next year with some prize money, let's see if we will also get a lan event in the future, would be nice. \n\n\nSo, whoever of you might be looking for a nice free to play shooter: TIHS IS IT.\nI can only recommend you to try it out, it runs very smoothly for me on ultra settings and I definitely will get addicted to it.", "timestamp_created": 1501259292, "timestamp_updated": 1542839966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.745820879936218262", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39799378": {"recommendationid": "39799378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030646995", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 40185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2027, "last_played": 1551843285}, "language": "english", "review": "I still cannot believe this game exists, it is too good to be true.

This game is sadly, dying. It's been on \"Early Access\" for way too long and I don't think it'll ever come out of it. Hackers are everywhere as the anti-cheat is literally not banning anyone after detection. Conspiracy related posts suggest that the game was from 2013, active cheaters are known to the developers, the support is quite bad & the development team is failing to maintain it all. But I must give them credit for trying & keeping a free online game up for so long.\n\n[h1]Game modes, game-play & interface[/h1]\n\nThis game has a lot of customization options. You can switch between a left-handed or a right-handed player model of all playable characters which is a bit unique. Crossair has lots of customization option as well. Overall interface is simple yet effective than most multiplayer games. There's only 2 musics which are horrible. There's two kinds of \"Radio\" message list available which basically plays audio commands to the whole team during matches. You have the option to write messages via chat to your team or to everyone in the match. Voice chat is only available in Competitive Match. You can block / unblock chats / voices at any time. Text chat features a messed up censoring system. It replaces tons of words & some alphabets in words with * but it can't tell the difference between a good word & an offensive word. It's improving with updates though.\n\nIt has so many game modes. The following 4 modes are basically the highlights: Team-Death-Match, Demolition, Assassination and Destruction.\nCompetitive mode is identical to the 5 vs 5 Demolition mode, except you get a rank. You can play solo, with a friend or a squad of 5 people, your rank will increase or decrease, depending on the outcome of the match.\nThere's a Custom Match channel that offers a ton of possibilities. Anyone can create and join custom matches of various types. You have the option to play with selected people by protecting the match with a password. This mode provides a lot of controls to the player & you can play against bots as well. Some game modes are exclusive to the Custom Match channel.\nThe Tournament Channel is only available to a handful of players, most people aren't authorized to enter. It's also worth mentioning that some experimental channels can sometimes be found on different servers.\n\nAll of the above mentioned game modes have several different maps which is really great, all maps are well made. All of the maps have numbered places on their mini-map, making it easier to communicate with teammates. However, you can find maps that were designed for Demolition modes with A, B, X & arrow pointers drawn on them in TDM matches which doesn't make sense.\n\nThe developers do introduce special occasion specific events / updates to the game which are unique & serve as a nice change of pace. This is quite interesting to say the least.\n\nYou can get small images as Spray & use them at any part of all the available maps. They'll last as long as that round & can be sprayed several times in a match. The Sprays are available through Lootboxes with the expiration date of 3 days. There are cosmetic backgrounds available to display behind your username. None of these give any advantages to anyone. [b]This game has almost no pay-to-win features.[/b] There are arguably only 3 pay-to-win weapons available right now..\n\nThe game-play isn't realistic but it's good enough for a free online game. Weapon damage, recoils and player movements are not at all realistic.\n\nIf you're looking for good graphics, this is not the game for you. Graphics could be improved a lot.\n\n[h1]The big issue with BattlEye[/h1]\n\nTheir update to the Anti-Cheat system BattlEye is annoying me the most. I understand that the game has many hackers. But to counter that, BattlEye is 'hardware-banning' people & collecting [b]everyone's[/b] hardware information which includes several serial numbers of our PC setup. Even though they're saying that they only store these information of the people that get banned, they're still [b]collecting unique hardware information of [u]every player[/u] of this game.[/b]\n\nI know that hardware based bans people will prevent hackers from creating a new account on the same PC & continue cheating but since BattlEye bans people based on statistics (resulting in false-positive bans which BattlEye is notorious for), these could have major side-effects. False-positive bans can happen to anyone & I don't know whether the developers can \"game-ban\" you on Steam or not but for a Free-To-Play game, this is too much in my opinion. I know BattlEye also monitors all running processes & any modifications to the game but that should be enough for an Anti-Cheat system. Running kernel driver is completely unnecessary.\n\nIf you get a hardware-based ban (false-positive or not), [b]BattlEye will not only permanently store your username but your PC configuration and their unique serial numbers as well.[/b] Basically, if you get a false-positive ban, your whole PC will be monitored by BattlEye, not just for this game or your Steam account but for all the games that uses BattlEye & all of your accounts on various gaming platforms. I think it's really risky to play a game with this kind of Anti-Cheat system.\n\nThe sad thing is, even with all these 'protections', BattlEye just kicks people from the match, it doesn't ban them. I've encountered people that were kicked by BattlEye in the previous match & playing again in a new match. In Competitive modes, they can just join back in after being kicked by BattlEye. The development team requires near-impossible proofs in order to take a report of cheating / hacking. To be honest, I don't think anyone's going to bother reporting players in this way. I suspect the cause of this is financial issues from the development team. To my knowledge, BattlEye can detect cheaters / hackers but need money from the developers to actually issue a ban.\n\n[h1]Lootboxes, Currencies & Weapons[/h1]\n\nThere are 4 types of in-game currency, Golds, Medals, BS Coins & Bullets. It's quite confusing to be honest. You can only purchase Bullets using real money. Golds and Medals can be earned by playing matches & completing timed challenges. Lootboxes mostly contain throwable items. Sprays or skin version of weapons that you probably own already (without the skin) with expiration date of 1, 3 or 7 days. The balance in currency & the ways in which you earn them changes constantly with new updates.\n\nThere are 3 kinds of shops available in the game. One shop has all the weapons you can buy using Golds only. The other shop has slightly better weapons that can be purchased using Medals. The Random Box shop has 2 options, better Lootboxes needs to be purchased using Bullets which can be bought via Steam in-game purchases. And the other option is to buy a low grade Lootbox using Golds. Gold & Medal shops also offer unique premium stuff & cosmetic items that require purchase using Bullets.\n\nWeapons that has a skin can only be purchased using 500 to 100000 BS Coins. But, BS Coins can be obtained by purchasing Lootboxes that require purchase using Bullets. 1 Lootbox that costs 80 Bullets can have several things in it, you'll most likely get throwable items with expiration dates but if you're really lucky, you can get a tinyl amount of BS Coins. Now imagine what's going to take to gather 100000 BS Coins to get 1 weapon that has a good skin! Lootbox that can be purchased using Golds has a small chance of dropping 10 BS Coins.\nThe overall economical balance and maintenance are terrible.\n\nThe game has 3 kinds of throwable items which are: grenades, flashbangs & smoke-bombs. It has tons of weapons of various types - most of them are unbalanced, especially sniper rifles. Skins doesn't affect the weapon's stats in anyway.\n\n[h1]I'll give it a 6 out of 10 at this moment.[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1523407526, "timestamp_updated": 1550676875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675172865390777588", "comment_count": 18, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "43843464": {"recommendationid": "43843464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158196956", "num_games_owned": 1805, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 12171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549236331}, "language": "english", "review": "[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/32296668-Casual-Game-Reviews/]More reviews on our Curator Page[/url]\n\n[b]Black Squad[/b] is one of the most popular traditional Online First Person Shooters on Steam at this moment, and although is not as popular as the king of Multiplayer action, [b]Counter Strike[/b], it sure has gathered an interesting amount of players.\nOriginally released on Steam exactly one year ago, the story behind [b]Black Squad[/b] goes away earlier, when was formerly launched back in 2013 in South-Korea. The original concept went through some major changes, to adopt a more realistic modern warfare.\n\nWith a short and simple tutorial, even newcomers can join this modern warfare multiplayer First Person Shooter, that\u2019s filled with adrenaline!\nThe concept is simple; two teams entitled [u]Viper Circle[/u] and [u]Peacemaker[/u], fight each other across multiple modes and maps, while earning Experience points to increase their ranks.\nEach player has a military rank that advances accordingly, and the more XP gathered, the further one goes.\nThe team behind the game made one thing clear, there won\u2019t be any Pay-To-Win elements, and so far their promise seems valid! Lootboxes however, are one of the more proftible ways\u00a0[i]NS STUDIO[/i]\u00a0can earn their share!\nPlayers earn free credits, but can also use real money to purchase Black Squad Bullets, in order to purchase special crates that may or may not contain the desired weapon or Black Squad coins, the premium currency for rare items. Although, in-game currency such as Credits and Medals can be used to unlock weapons, some limited skins and even a couple of extras to extend the customization!\n\nExactly one year later, [b]Black Squad[/b] is still in Early Access, and with peaks between 5 to 10 thousand players online every day, where does this game stands at in 2018?\nIn pretty good shape one would say, but there\u2019s always room for improvement. Using Unreal Engine 3, it\u2019s an open door for both players on budget desktops, and high ending ones, plus, the current options allow its user a tremendous optimization.\n\nSpecific in-game options such as Character, Backgrounds, Lightning Effect, Shadows, Effects, and Physics range from Very Low - Low - Medium - High - Ultra, to help you reach the performance you most desire in a competitive game, but many other options are available. Limiting the framerate, Virtual Sync, Anti-Aliasing, Thread Sync and Refresh rate is something players can change accordingly.\nOther extra visual options are included such as Gun Trail Effect, Color Filters, and even Blood Effect, where gamers who are sensitive to blood, can replace the red with white, for a much different experience. Crossfire experts will have a great time, as they are custom-built, in size, shape and color. Mouse and overall keys are customized for both click and pressing options, and that\u2019s rare even for new released games!\n\nVisually, it\u2019s extremely pleasant going through each map, either under a clear blue sky, or a night at the docks filled with neon lights. Objects and structures are simple but very well designed, perfect for those who are always visually attracted to the game\u2019s goodies.\nMaps are somehow inspired by real locations such the Avignon, inspired by a french city, and they have a fantastic light work. Each area is unique and has its very unique style and artisticapproach over war sceneries.\nIt\u2019s somehow a breath of fresh air to see Unreal Engine 3 being used with a dedicated color palette, even in 2018!\nMap design offers all sorts of play style, with different weapons. Each map as a perfect sniping spot, or a runway down for assault rifles. Other maps such as the VBSS, a level based on a cruiser, have plenty of hiding spots for campers or just overall sneaking players!\n\nWith fantastic set of options that were added through this past year to please gamers worldwide, servers across the globe were also progressively added, even if Australia still needs one, how does the gameplay stands out you may wonder? It\u2019s a tremendous experience, very fluid, and much pleasant. If the gameplay was all it took, [b]Black Squad[/b] would be a serious competitor to [b]Counter Strike[/b], but a lot of things influence it, including the netcode, which is solid and responsive, yet it needs improvement. Technical glitches are still present though, but for a small team under 10 employees, [b]Black Squad[/b] has been almost outstanding!\n\n[b]Black Squad[/b] has five game modes. Team Death Match, where two teams of 8 players each fight in rounds of 10 minutes, or maximum kills of 150, where the team with more kills win.\nDemolition is another classic mode, where one team must place the explosive, and the other must defuse it. This mode has up to 12\u00a0players each side.\nSuch as Demolition, in Assassination mode, killed players cannot join the session, and as one team must kill the VIP, and the other must protect it, in a match up to 8 vs 8 players.\nThe final mode called Destruction places two teams, up to 16 players each side, on a large map with destructible objects available in strategic places. The team who destroys the most, earns the most, and the final team to accumulate more points win. This mode as another variant where one team attacks a specific spot, and the other team protects it.\nAcross all these modes, players can customize their preferences in specific maps and a set of rules, creating a different approach for each mode and guns! doesn\u2019t want to do a malee-only-match on a gladiator arena? Yes, it is possible!\n\nMaps have been added halfway through this last year, but they seem to come to an end, and their management has changed as well. Across the 30 maps available, locations such as Dust Shield were removed from Team Death Match to become a Demolition exclusive! This happened a few times, and pretty much defined Team Death Match as a frenetic, fastpaced action, where most players won\u2019t be able to rest, not even for a second!\n\nWeaponry is pretty much of what one would expect of a [b]Counter Strike[/b] competitor. A large amount of Assault Rifles, SMG\u2019s.

[/b] [/u] [spoiler] (Yes I know there are less experienced players, don't worry) [/spoiler]\n\n[b] If I'm typing any of these and it is in the game, it probably means it needs a slighty more fix than what it is, or they did fix them. [/b]\n\n\n[*] Netcode needs slight improvement [/*]\n\n[*] Running and gunning is being rewarded more than skill: people can hold W and keep shooting, make it so you have to strafe and shoot, not hold W (or figure something else out) [/*]\n\n[*] The crouch spam: add an animation and delay after crouching 2-3 times so it gets slower and slower (omg just like csgo!!!) [/*]\n\n[*] [strike] The most op shotgun, the so called KSG that is better than any gun right now, pls fix.  [/strike]\n[*] [strike] Jumpshotting is 80% effective, make it so the odds are more high for less jump shots. [/*] [/strike]\n\n[*] [strike]Team collision/overtime/custom gamemodes (like rifle only, no nade etc) should be an option when being able to host a lobby (in the future) [/*] [/strike]\n\n[*] [strike] SMGs being able to outclass a rifle (put less range/damage when far) [/strike] [/*]\n\n[*] Make a ping limit to 100 and less, this means more servers (AS, OC, SEA,) but everyone is happy [/*]\n\n[*] Make more damage variation when long distance and more difficultly to spray so you have to tap the gun [/*]\n\n[*] [strike] Fix flashbangs, you get flashed in cover or when you're a couple of distance away from it and turn around to face the other way. [/*] [/strike]\n\n[*] Add the regen to 30 health back, it gives a slight chance of actually clutching. You can get downed to 3 health very fast in the start because of the nade spams. [or make it optional]\n\n[*] Snipers having no chance vs more than one guy after shooting once because the delay is longer than it should be \n(watch video [url=https://youtu.be/cHfcyGISA3U?t=1m52s]here[/url] to see what I mean), keep the MSR's delay as it is since it shoots fast, but adjust for DSR-1 and BLAZER back to normal, optional: add aimpunch % back to like korea. (This would balance it back) [/*]\n\n[spoiler] To people that complain snipers are op, you need to learn that you technically have 3 nades 1 smoke and prefire/jumping around is a thing, don't forget if a sniper is scoped in they get aimpunched, you should also probably not stand still and wait for them, have an other buddy outsnipe them or play in rifle only gamemodes that i listed above as suggestion because yes it is annoying in TDM but it serves a purpose and shouldn't be changed. Also, you have to stand still before shooting, any slight movement will make you miss. [/spoiler]\n\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The 3 types of rifles[/h1]\n\nBefore starting, there are 3 types of rifles, ''Hardpunchers'' ''Balanced'' and ''Laserguns''\n\nHardpunchers are supposed to be a one hit in the head, laserguns are very easy to handle but 2-3 hit in the head, balanced is in between both.\n\n[*] Right now hardpuncher players have no reason to keep using a hardpuncher when a laser gun can dominate you, laser guns are way to easy to spray and pray while moving, make them less accurate while moving and/or reduce damage of it and make it actually 3-4 hit in the head, right now it is almost always a 2 hit in the head no matter the range [/*]\n\n[*] Balanced guns are literally useless, they are always a 2 hit in the head and do 3-4 more damage than a laser gun,if a laser gun is 3-4 hits, then the balanced guns have an actual purpose [/*]\n\n[*] Hardpuncher should have tagging back, the only reason we wanted it gone was because of the high pingers, with a no lag fix to punish high pingers instead of both, the tagging should come back. [/*]\n\n[*] Since there will be only 1 type of armor (the default version): \nLaser guns should have a nerf with SMGs, have a better damage dropoff and [strike] make it so SMGs have to tap to actually fire in long range, burst in medium and spray in close. (as i said before above) [/strike] [/*]\n\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Other [/h1]\n\n[*] Need more stable servers [/*]\n[*] An event like in Korea would be nice, more new players in the future.

This game is going to stay in early access forever because they won't fix anything and just be like \"It's early access so don't expect game to have no bugs\" even tho there are bugs out for years now and they don't fix them\n\nCan't recommend this one :(", "timestamp_created": 1549305003, "timestamp_updated": 1549306185, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.726791679859161377", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "41993154": {"recommendationid": "41993154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198392479381", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 3687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1541417044}, "language": "english", "review": "Poor man's CS:GO???", "timestamp_created": 1526113240, "timestamp_updated": 1526113240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 92, "weighted_vote_score": "0.70631110668182373", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39378948": {"recommendationid": "39378948", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973184948", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516063698}, "language": "english", "review": "good stuff:\n-f2p\n-great looking game, even looks better than cod ww2 imo but any half decent game can accomplish that\n-gameplay is smooth and responsive\n-sounds are good, nice cracking sound when you headshot someone which backs the point above\n-no p2w guns like other asian f2p shooters\n-start with a massive amount of credits to choose guns\n\n-bad stuff \n-terrible map design (the guys who designed the maps should get an award for how bad they are), the spawn camping is sometimes horrible and you can't break out, \n-snipers are way too good in this game from a mix of horrible maps, how fast people run and how you can move and shoot with no accuracy loss. <- honestly this is my biggest gripe with the game\n-spray patterns are hilariously random, theres no way to predict it from how much horizontal recoil there is. \n-grenades are either miss or take most of your life\n-netcode is wonky sometimes, you can notice it when you duck up and down walls fast\n-unable to veto/pick maps to queue\nafterthoughts:\ngame is actually not that bad, if you've played AVA (rip that game) this game is extremely reminiscent of that with the ability to fly around corners and not get punished for moving and shooting\nthis game has potential to improve but it suffers the curse of being developed by a korean studio. what I mean is that like every korean made game, they have a good vision of what the game is and most of the time have a good artistic direction but always fall short of maintaing the game to a high standard and end up bleeding players because of bad decisions and lack of communication between (since i'm reviewing this on steam, I'm obviously a western player) the devs and the western community. if they can get over this hurdle and actually talk to the players instead of them [the players] flinging verbal abuse at a verbal punching bag (the community manager/s) then the game will have a future in the western market (inb4", "timestamp_created": 1516065703, "timestamp_updated": 1517505761, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 192, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.753055214881896973", "comment_count": 28, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35988521": {"recommendationid": "35988521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093669351", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507836558}, "language": "english", "review": "Still needs some work to make it a good game, but the basics are good", "timestamp_created": 1508937816, "timestamp_updated": 1508937816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709306478500366211", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40514370": {"recommendationid": "40514370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046764217", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1529513134}, "language": "english", "review": "This game used to be amazing, now it is just full of hackers.

Well, this one is actually pretty good and does not suffer from any major flaws like many others do.\n\nFor starters, it's currently one of the most popular and you will always find a game in the mode you want at pretty much any hour. That's a big part of an online game and this one has been running for a couple years and is in a state that assures several more months, maybe even years. It is still not too late to start playing.\nIn terms of lag and hit detection, it really is serviceable and apart from a few instances, you won't need to switch server or game to have a lag-free experience.\nFew hackers, most are pretty obvious but never stay long and by taking a look at the recent updates, they're doing something to fix this. All in all, definitely not a major concern as it remains, as I said, infrequent.\n\nAnother big part of F2P games is the currency and the economy. Once again, Black Squad does well as it is pretty generous. You can obviously have everything right away if you decide to buy it with real money but that will be pretty expensive. However if you decide to take the free-to-play route, with the daily rewards, the daily / weekly / monthly missions and post-game rewards, this all adds up quickly enough and if you also take into account that every other month there are events where the rewards are much bigger and everything is 30 to 50% off in the shop, you end with a model that is affordable for everyone, whether you use your time or your money.\nThe only thing basically locked behind a paywall are the skins, and well...they're skins so if you really want them, play during the events and you'll get some and free weapons at the same time. Nice !\n\nSpeaking of guns, Black Squad packs quite a punch. Shotguns, smgs, assault rifles, sniper rifles, in-betweens, melee weapons... There is a lot to play and experiment with and there is something for everyone. More get added over time, balance patches regularly...It works !\n\nNow I still have a few gripes with the game, the main one being the spaws in deathmatch mode, which is the most popular like in all F2P shooters. Unlike Call of Duty where they're \"dynamic\" or \"not set\", here there is a spawn\npoint for each team and that's it. As you can probably imagine, that leads to a lot of problems like spawn killing as soon as the teams are not balanced, which is boring for one side and sucks for the other. Some less popular modes don't always have multiple games to join which means that when they're full, well you're out of luck. After playing for some time, the main currency that you get everywhere becomes useless and you're left with 3 millions in the bank without any use.\n\nThose are for the most part minor, and you can adapt your experience and get what you want from the game. It's a shooter, pretty generous, and it works. If you don't like the latest Counter Strike or Call of Duty, but want to shoot guns, turn to this one and you will probably have a good time.\n\nThat's a [b] 7\t[/b] from me, and as a F2P shooter, I recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1546648630, "timestamp_updated": 1546648811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.711485385894775391", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38234103": {"recommendationid": "38234103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198420199114", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 59035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 912, "last_played": 1551650823}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is good so far but it needs more things ,options like changing names- buying skins with medals , chat voice ... etc \n", "timestamp_created": 1512996795, "timestamp_updated": 1512996795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635157585144042969", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39753412": {"recommendationid": "39753412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148378615", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518995916}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Free FPS Game Ever !\n-Great Gameplay\n-Amazing Graphics For Free FPS\n-No Cheat\n-Not Pay To Win\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1517425459, "timestamp_updated": 1517425459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.659209489822387695", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34052289": {"recommendationid": "34052289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062905995", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 36824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1524069967}, "language": "english", "review": "Wew, Okay lets go..\n\nThis game is probably the best f2p FPS you got out there.. No P2W (Unless you count skipping playing a few hours to unlock a gun permanently p2w). It is important to note that you also start with enough gold to buy 3 weapons of your choice.. However you can only have 3 loadouts so you don't actually need more at the start.\n\nThe steam promo allows you to have all the guns for free for 15 days to test out which 3 you want to buy with your initial cash..\n\n\nThe maps are quite average, decent but nothing special (so far). There is a few game modes as well and I'll review each one really quick.\n\nTeam Deathmatch: Generic team deathmatch with a short spawn protection and fast paced gameplay.. My personal favorite because it's quick.\n\n8v8 Demolition: 8v8 Csgo clone thing; One team plants the bomb, other team defuses.\n\n5v5 demo: 5v5 csgo clone thing; One team plants the bomb, other team defuses.\n\nVIP: Confusing i still dont get it, You have to protect a vip that is like, a npc I think? Sometimes it starts running off, sometimes it dies and you still win.. It's just weird.\n\nBattle match: Some kind of objective based map with 16v16 and classes and tons of fancy stuff.\n\n\nOverall guns feel mostly good, the game has a high skill ceiling.. I found a lot of weapons to be very viable.\n\n1: Get a SMG like the Kris Vector or SIZMPX and rush enemies akin to Quake/Teamforteress\n2: Get a shotgun and play your corners. You will easily one shot enemies.\n3: Get a sniper and hold an unpopular long hall. This gives a lot of room for your team to push.\n4: Get AK47/ AK12/ HNK / SR-47, keep crosshair head level and slow turn corners to one tap.\n5: Get a steady weapon like the MDR or G36 and follow someone, using them as bait to steal their kills.\n\nThose are all effective ways to end up with 40+ kills per game. (TDM)\n\n\nBad players trying to empty their guns into your arm dealing a fraction of the damage while if you aim right you can 2-3 shot kill them very easily.. The game is quite good to make good players snowball which results in a lot of people crying about hackers every single game.\n\nAbout the hacker situation, this game does fairly well. While you do see some of them once in a while, they're far less common than say CSGO.. (Let alone other f2p games)\n\nWhile it's not a AAA title. Given their budget and the playing cost. It was far higher than my expectations..

It is truly Free to Play. Black Squad is simply the best F2P PvP shooter on PC !\n\nLong story: Black Squad is a kind of brilliant mix between CS GO and Ghost in the Shell (another Korean game). Let\u2019s look first at its strong points:\n* Runs smoothly on old computers. My January 2012 PC runs great with all details on. What a change from games such as Ark Survival ! Also no network lag.\n* Weapon balance is impressive. ARs are versatile, SMGs / shotguns are close to mid range, snipers mid to long range. At first I believed snipers were at a disadvantage because characters move so fast. But if you pick the right spot you can do many kills and also deny access to enemy. Killing is great but blocking enemy is important too.\n* Maps are well designed. There aren\u2019t many per game mode but they are subtle.\n* Black Squad is really Free to Play. You can download free access to weapons for 14 days. Twice. Great for testing before unlocking. In a month you can gather enough gold and medals to buy really many weapons. Only skins require real money.  \n* Developers seriously listen to the community. Recently many players complained that shotguns were OP. Nerfed in the next patch !\n* Character leveling up and daily / weekly missions are well designed. They give a purpose. In CS GO you play for ranking. In BS for medals and gold.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the weak points:\n* Servers are often down. Let\u2019s hope this is just a youth issue.\n* Characters move too fast. Bunny hops are lame. It\u2019s okay to move fast with the knife. It makes the game fast paced. But it should slow down when carrying primary weapon. Slow down more than it does. Arcadish sprint and jumping around is good in a hero shooter such as Overwatch. But in a \u2018serious\u2019 military shooter it does not fit.\n* No matchmaking based on ranking. Ranking is very important in a PvP shooter because it allows fair games. When noobs are crushed by vets they get frustrated and leave the game. Hopefully as the game grows, Elo based ranking will be implemented.\n* Game modes. This is the main flaw of the game. Firstly there are too many game modes which spray the community. Secondly several game modes are sub optimal. Team Death match is great. Battle 16vs16 with skills like Overwatch / Paladins, why not. At first it seems chaotic. But a deep strategy is possible. Next game mode, Assassination 8vs8 is boring: when you die you might wait for a long time because a team of 8 is huge. Same for demolition 8vs8. Demolition 5v5 seems good. But it requires coordination. Unfortunately, contrary to CS GO, nobody uses a mic. And many players don\u2019t even understand the basic strategy of demolition. They play like death match. And they get crushed.\nWhat lacks badly is a capture the flag mode.\n\nTo sum-up, despite game modes flaws, Black Squad is the best and most popular F2P PvP shooter available.

The performance is amazing, i have played it both on a 2017 gaming pc and on  a potato. Both ran perfectly on low and even high settings.\n2. There isn't much Pay2Win in this game but there are some things that just suck\n3.  I must say, the skin and currency system is built nicely, and the bullets are relatively cheap.\nthe skins and guns are mostly original\n4.While not having much Quick Play modes, it has a lot of custom gamemodes which i enjoy playing\n5. The free DLC for the game is not bad, and i think it could be helpful for new players to choose whether they want to buy a gun or not.\nCons:\n1. Pay2Win exist, but not much of it. (i'm not counting the 200,000 gold you get from the start since i spent it all on cases) You can get a gun (for example, an ak47) after you've played the game for long enough, but a rich person could buy it before they even get into their first match.\n2. The shop is pure @#*&. When i saw the shop, i instanty thought \"Wait, did I launch Warface?\"\nBuying grenades is not a good idea. Having weapons that you can use only for a limited time would only pass of as a bad joke.\n3. While not a really bad mistake, the english translation needs some work.\nOverall, i liked the game, but it has things you should change. This is Early Access, so you have enough time to fix this. I didn't play the game for very long, but i doubt anything will change except my loadout.\n\nIf i had the opportunity to rate it out of 10, i would rate it 7.5/10.\n\n\nEdit:There is a bug(At least for me) that after a match the Random Box menu will not be openable. No matter if i had enough bullets or coins. \n \nAlso some ways you can fix the bad parts of the game.\n\n1. (Problem - Pay2Win exist, but not much of it. (i'm not counting the 200,000 gold you get from the start since i spent it all on cases) You can get a gun (for example, an ak47) after you've played the game for long enough, but a rich person could buy it before they even get into their first match.) \nFix - I'd say add a \"Unlock Weapons Before You Can Use Them\" feature. It could really make the game more friendly for new players. Oh, and also make some kind of skill level separation. \n\n2. (Problem - The shop is pure @#*&. When i saw the shop, i instanty thought \"Wait, did I launch Warface?\"\nBuying grenades is not a good idea. Having weapons that you can use only for a limited time would only pass of as a bad joke.) \nFix - Just scrap the shop in this game completely and make it (As said above) \"Unlock A Weapon To Use It\"\n\n3. (Problem - 3. While not a really bad mistake, the english translation needs some work.) \nFix - No comment.\n\nEdit 2: \n\nI thought of some ideas that really could make the game more community-friendly.\n\n1. Workshop integration. A good idea would be to make the Workshop like in CS:GO. (Custom maps that can be downloaded for free and skins that can be voted if people want them in-game)\n\n2. Now, the UI is a bit confusing and i recommend you change it. Make it simple, with the shop, medal shop and case shop in the same section, Custom and Quick Play in  the same list (Kind of like in Battlefield 4).\n\n3. While it would be expensive, a companion mobile app would make the game better. Being able to buy skins or guns while you're not near your computer is a pretty good idea.\n\n4. While not being the best idea, being able to sell skins on Steam would be interesting.

Theres some hit-reg issues. \nBiggest problems so far are not enough players and \"error with the anti-cheat program\" bugs which just randomly started happening after 2 weeks of playing fine with no issues are annoying and keep closing the game. \n\nPlus anime chicks with jiggle physics.", "timestamp_created": 1540591361, "timestamp_updated": 1540591361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37597083": {"recommendationid": "37597083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159643079", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 61872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 488, "last_played": 1551866724}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a really good game with perfect hitbox, good competive maps, lot of updates, skins but if wont starts on ESL its will die ...\n(Everybody hope will start soon)", "timestamp_created": 1511652958, "timestamp_updated": 1511652958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33861493": {"recommendationid": "33861493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046267284", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501297069}, "language": "english", "review": "*TACT RELOAD*", "timestamp_created": 1501264609, "timestamp_updated": 1501264609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 43, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580882251262664795", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33984137": {"recommendationid": "33984137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008091552", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502068656}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun and addictive game.

Well they sell cosmetic skins for the weapons as well as lootboxes which also include purely cosmetic items.\n\nThere ARE negatives to this game though:\n-Very few maps, many of which are uninspired and some of which are fairly unbalanced\n-No FFA mode\n-No toggle-crouch option\n\nI know those cons are nit-picky, but every game has its flaws and this game (especially to be a f2p) has very few.\n\n8/10\n\nTAC RELOAD!", "timestamp_created": 1501436551, "timestamp_updated": 1501436551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505325436592102051", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33985639": {"recommendationid": "33985639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131632286", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 868, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1543233378}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game !!!

If you played Ghost In The Shell: SAC then you'll be familiar with it. \nYou pick a primary, secondary, melee, grenade and other equipment relevant to that playstyle per F slot. During games you can quickly switch between these presets after death to choose a different playstyle. \n\n-Graphically the game looks great. \n\n-The maps are well thought out.\n\n-Based on the amount of firearms in the game, I suspect there will be a lot of choice in the future.\n\n-Blood on the walls after you kill someone. \n\nCons:\n\n-No sprint option, you have to use a knife to run. This makes me sad. I like my games realistic and with all the other efforts this game chose to make that so, you'd figure this would be too. \n\n-Health is not based on parts of your body, except the head which is an instant kill. I'd very much rather see arms, legs and torso have their own HP with lowering movement speed if legs are damaged and lowering accuracy if arms are damaged. \n\n-No stamina bar, so bunny hoppers run rampant. This will also allow for greater success with aimbots.\n\ntl;dr: This game looks great and plays well. It still has a chance to improve.
