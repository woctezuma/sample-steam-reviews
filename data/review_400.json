Here's a hint: You need to gain some momentum if you want to make some distance when you exit the second portal, and oft times that means falling -- not just jumping -- through a portal. \n\nThere is some platforming involved, and a variety of obstacles (of course, what kind of game would this be if there weren't obstacles?) in your way, both benign and deadly, and through it all is your ever-present narrator-guide.  I don't recommend muting her, as you'll miss out on both the ambience and a huge part of the story if you do (subtitles alone just aren't the same~).\n\nBut.. what story?  O_o The game is tagged story-rich, so I was surprised to find that there wasn't much of a story at all!  Sure it was interesting, but story-rich?  But then... finally... It all changed.  Sure it was something I was expecting, but things didn't pan out exactly how I had anticipated, either.\n\nYou will have to get through 11 chapters before approaching the end of the game, and as you complete each chapter, the Developer Commentary becomes available (accessible via the main menu.)  Whilst you're in commentary mode, you can't be damaged, but you also won't gain achievements.\n\nSpeaking of achievements, there are 15 to be had, and only 1/3 of them can be gained by playing through the game.  There are Advanced Chambers and Challenges available via the Bonus Maps section which is where you'll earn the bulk of your achievements.\n\nIt's easy to see the influences that this game has had on modern gaming, especially games like [i][url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/257510/]The Talos Principle[/url][/i].

Even if you don't play puzzle games, you should still give it a try. The puzzles aren't too difficult. The game slowly introduces new mechanic so that it's really easy to grasp. And solving the puzzles are soooooo satisfying! \n\nWhat's more? It's a puzzle game that has a great background story and although there is only one character other than the main protagonist, it's one of the best NPC in video game history.

Glados is one of the best virtual characters in recent years. That computer has more personality than many humans from other games.\n\nThroughout the game the player acquires a portal gun. This gun allows you to create portals, to enter and exit portals in order to go forward in the game, which requires solving logic puzzles to advance. You will  acquire a good sense of physics, position and movement.\n\nThe game is a marvel of Valves creativity. Many would prefer to kill zombies in left 4 dead , but personally, I think games like Portal are those who write history. The game lasts a few hours and when it finishes,  with music and lyrics, it makes you want to stand and applaud. No other game in recent years has touched me so much when it ended. It is an ode to creativity.\n\nIts sequel , Portal 2, expands the concept of the game and makes it much longer, making it a standalone game. The Portal 2 was named Game of the Year in 2011 for various publications.\n\nThe game was released for Windows PC , PS3 and XBOX 360 before being ported to MAC OSX.\n\nNow that I've finished the review I want my cake ! .\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nESPA\u00d1OL\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPortal es un videojuego de l\u00f3gica y estrategia en primera persona desarrollado por Valve en 2007 y lanzado en un paquete llamado Orange Box. \n\nEl jugador despierta en una sala de cristal, el centro de desarrollo de Aperture Science, donde es sometido a una serie de experimentos hasta que \u2026\u2026 no les voy a arruinar el juego....\nEn cada experimento lo va guiando una voz, que es Glados, la computadora central del centro de desarrollo. Glados es uno de los mejores personajes virtuales de los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. Esta computadora tiene m\u00e1s personalidad que muchos humanos de otros juegos.\n\nA lo largo del juego el jugador adquiere una pistola de portales. Esta pistola de portales le permite generar portales para entrar y salir por donde le es posible e ir avanzando en el juego, que requiere resolver acertijos l\u00f3gicos para seguir adelante. Para ello hay que adquirir un buen sentido de la f\u00edsica, la posici\u00f3n y el movimiento.\n\nEl juego es una maravilla de la creatividad de Valve. Quizas muchos prefieran matar zombies como en el left 4 dead, pero personalmente creo que juegos como el Portal son los que escriben la historia. Finalmente al terminar en unas pocas horas, con musica y letra, dan ganas de pararse y aplaudir. Ningun juego posterior a portal me emocion\u00f3 tanto. Es una oda a la creatividad.\n\nSu secuela, el Portal 2 ampl\u00eda el concepto del juego y lo hace mucho m\u00e1s largo, convirti\u00e9ndolo en un juego independiente.

It's quirky at best, but it also remains clever, resolute and perfectly presented to those with likings for a quick-wit and a scientific explanation for including physics in a well-thought out and intelligent game, all with a touch of dark humour. It's quite rare to see a Steam user with a huge game library that doesn't include Portal nowadays. Heck, this game was my very first purchase.\n\nYou awaken in the deserted Enrichment Center of Aperture Laboratories; a fictional science research corporation, located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Known for the creation of the handheld portal gun, as well as the heavy rivalry the complex has between the Black Mesa Research Facility. (The scientific complex focused in Half-Life. Half-Life and Portal both share the same universe.) in Portal, you play as the silent protagonist, Chell, from a first-person perspective as you are challenged to navigate through a series of cryptic chambers, all the while being accompanied by the voice of the Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System (GlaDOS for short.) which the sociopathic robot subsequently reveals the rest of the plot to the player, through various and long-winded narration throughout the game. And what is this reward you get for all this mind-wrecking work? Why it's none other than cake! \n\nWhile on the subject of sweet chocolate butter-milk frosting, assembled with maraschino cherries on top, this all turns out to be a crude lie, and you're sent to be burnt to a crisp by GlaDOS. As you narrowly escape death, you navigate through the many things that Aperture Laboratories would have wanted to keep as a secret to the rest of the world. You soon (or later, as this game has a way of messing with your head.) find yourself exploring the air vents, empty corners with obscure writings on the wall, the sewers of the facility, as well as the abandoned, deserted offices of those who mysteriously left the complex, along with empty food supplies and crude drawings that uncovers a much darker history of the laboratories.\n\nWhat strikes me most surprised is this game's ingenius concept and profound knowledge of linear momentum and physics. Your only weapon in the game, if you can call it a weapon, is the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. It's main and only ability is to create two distinct portals, an orange and blue portal, which both create a visual and physical connection between two different locations in three-dimensional space. Keep in mind that neither portal are both an entrance or an exit; all objects that travel through one portal will exit through the other. This unique concept will soon be taken to the test, as you explore, solve and escape through 19 mind-wrecking chambers all the while keeping your distance both far and dangerously close to heavily armed turret bots.\n\nBut, you're not alone in this deranged prison of a laboratory, your square-buddy (and probably only buddy.) known as the Companion Cube, will accompany you throughout a few of these chambers, as it has a handful of most needed traits; involving you using it as an extra step for those hard-to-reach places, using it as a shield against deadly laser spheres and deflecting them into switch mechanisms, and even going as so far to hold out weight-activated button switches. Sadly, with every chamber completed thanks to your Companion Cube, you will have to eventually abandon it and leave it for trash, in the Emergency Intelligence Incinerator. What a true friend to the end!\n\nWhen cracking down to the lifespan of this game's story, it's actually pretty short. But, with each new chamber you progress through as well as the difficulty beginning to rise at a much faster pace, the longer the chambers will begin to mess with your head and could leave you stuck for a good couple of hours, completely stumped. I'm guilty to say that I even needed a guide to deal with a couple of these cryptic and twisted chambers. But then again, that really ruined the experience for me a little, considering I like to figure things out much more independently. So, if you can unwrap things around your mind quick and efficiently, you may experience the amazement and creativity for yourself. I'm pretty jealous in fact.\n\nThis game is a big recommendation for me. The scientific aspect of portal and three-dimensional space used in this game is best described as baffling.

In terms of video games: it is the very definition of short & sweet. There are many people out there overly concerned with the length of games, and I believe [b]Portal[/b] is an excellent example of why one shouldn\u2019t immediately scoff at a short game due to prejudices. Sometimes 3 hours of perfection is better than 20 hours of mediocrity. Sit down, immerse yourself, and just play through the game in one sitting as you would if watching a movie. It is worth it.\n\nI say this because I believe this is a game best enjoyed in one sitting. There are no lulls or down points, and every second of the game is riveting and purposeful. The whole experience is so genuinely entertaining and the pacing is so perfectly on point that I think it is designed to be played like this. In this way, I see the length of the game as a strength and not a weakness\u2026 but maybe I\u2019m just crazy.\n\nBut what is it that makes the game so genuinely entertaining in the first place? Everything\u2026 and then some. The concept is innovative, the puzzles are intuitive and interesting, the atmosphere is captivating, and the dialogue is hilarious and flawless. And when all of these facets come together in the finished product, the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. And a game is created that transcends opinions: it is undeniably great.\n\nHonestly, I respect everyone\u2019s right to their own taste in video games; but if you don\u2019t enjoy [b]Portal[/b], I would dutifully suggest you consider finding a new hobby. I would find it very hard to understand how anyone could possibly not enjoy this game if they consider themselves a \u201cgamer.\u201d\n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet had the luxury of experiencing [b]Portal[/b], then I envy you.

Play with HDR enabled for the full effect, the lighting is amazing.\n\n- A very subtle story that is not told really throught the main game but more through the many secrets hiding behild the pearly white walls of Apeture Science.\n\n- The game can get challenging, but not really in the unfair way, this game requires you to think things through and to take your time, it is a puzzle game after all.\n\n- For the most part the game has great pacing, there are only 1 or 2 spots in the game where I feel the game slows to a crawl or feels tedious.\n\n- The game is easy to pickup and play, and after your first or second playthrough you could easily breeze through the game like it was nothing.\n\n[b]The Negatives[/b]\n\n- After chamber 13, the game's difficulty spikes up unexpectingly, so for your first playthrough it can be a bit of a shock.\n\n- The last chapter in the game is a bit too long. They buildup the confrontation of GLados alot. And in the last chapter the puzzle are not really hard or too interesting. It kinda kills the pacing for me, I would not have a problem with the game slowing down a bit at the end to build hype, but that blends into my next issue.\n\n- The battle with Glados is not hard at all. The payoff for all the stuff you went through is lackluster. Here is how the battle goes. Hit Glados with a rocket, knock off core, grab it, put it in a cremator. Rinse and repeat 3 times and you win.  I'm not saying Glados is not an interesting villian, i'm just saying that the fight against it is kinda bad.\n\n- The length of the game is a bit too short. 19 chambers, a chapter dedicated to escaping the test chambers, and a final fight with Glados. That is all you get for the campaign. Even for a first timer like me it will take anywhere from 3-4 hours to beat the game. There is a time attack mode, and some advanced courses, but I will be generous and say they will add another 5 hours of gameplay. You have at the most about 10-11 hours of gameplay. Pitiful for a Valve title.\n\n- The game does not have too much replay value. I bet by your 3rd playthrough you will know each chamber like the back of your hand, and you could plow through the game.\n\n- Screw chamber 19, that is the only unfair hard part of the game for me.\n\n- Ganeraly I think the game is kinda bare bones once you look past the portal mechanics and the pretty aesthetic.\n\n[b]Summary[/b]\n\nOverall, I think I can look past some of the glaring flaws, because beyond the few blemishes the game is excellent. It is just a game I would not see myself playing again and again.\n\nI give Portal a very solid 8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1511489689, "timestamp_updated": 1511489705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.791823327541351318", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43080175": {"recommendationid": "43080175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315680994", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 2326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1522201445}, "language": "english", "review": "I do not need to say anything\nThis game has been proven :D\nI recommend this game to all gamers who have not played yet ;)", "timestamp_created": 1530045941, "timestamp_updated": 1530045941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.786129355430603027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47724012": {"recommendationid": "47724012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258308313", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545522961}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow.

You play as Chell, a female protagonist that completes testings for Aperture Science Laboratories. The game features a nineteen level campaign that allows you to solve puzzles. Solving each puzzle progresses you further into the story. This review will discuss the campaign, the levels, and gameplay.\n\nPortal features a solid campaign that provides a good introduction to the world of the Laboratories. The game begins with an in-game tutorial introducing you to the portal gun, the tests and Glados, the antagonist AI computer. Portal excels at storytelling through the slow burn approach to the story. Certain sequences in the story subtly reveal major plot points such as what is Glados planning to do to Chell once she has completed her tests. These subtle hints provide excitement for those who have noticed them as it foreshadows the final scenes in the game. Portal 1 is less about story and more about introducing you to the environment. I get the vibe that this game is more like a prologue to Portal 2 because comparing Portal 1 to Portal 2, P2 expands on the gameplay and environment and emphasises the story whereas P1 introduces you to the setting, the characters, the type of gameplay, and the story. In saying that, I do really like the introduction to the characters as Glados is a refreshing computer personality in which gives the impression that robots control humans, or Glados controls Chell.\n\nThe campaign as mentioned includes nineteen levels and these levels are basic. It promotes creativity as the levels progressively become more difficult. However, I feel the majority of the levels are simple and relatively easy compared to the final five levels. The final five levels are challenging and they require more thinking, meaning they encourage more exploration on how to complete it. The levels are of good length. About 10 out of the 19 levels took some time to complete and it lengthened the game and made it more enjoyable because the overall campaign was short at under three hours. Portal features an 'advanced levels' mode which takes the final six levels of the campaign, reworks them and makes them much more difficult to complete. I did not play this mode because I prefer not to replay the same levels with no end goal. Generally though, it does add some variety and lasting appeal to the game for players.\n\nPortal incorporates some vibrant and detailed gameplay, particularly in the portal gun. The portal gun allows you to create two portals that transport you from A to B. Comparatively, Portal 1 delivers on the shooting aspect of the portal gun because when shooting the portal gun there is a visible bullet that travels and it creates a graphics effect when it hits the target. This exceeds the portal gun shooting animations in Portal 2 which once you shoot the gun it automatically hits the target. Furthermore, the portal gun has fitting sound that complements it. I only encountered one issue in the entire game, which is relatively minor, and that is the somewhat less-responsive nature of the controls. For instance, picking up objects would regularly require two clicks on a regular basis and when some levels have timed sections it can become slightly annoying.\n\nPortal has very optimised performance. I played on max settings at something like 200FPS after turning off V-Sync. With V Sync enabled, I managed 50FPS and minimal stuttering.\n\n[h1] [b] Conclusion [/b] [/h1]\nPortal is a very solid game. It introduces you to the robot-run world and the world of testing. The story is fun in that it introduces you to the setting and characters through a slow burn story approach. The game has nineteen levels which I completed in under three hours. There is an advanced levels mode featuring the six final levels in the campaign that are more challenging. I get the notion that Portal is a prologue to Portal 2 as it is establishes all the aspects in the game, which is vastly expanded on in the sequel. In saying that, I enjoyed this first instalment into the Portal series. At USD$9.99 as a standalone product, I recommend it. However, I highly recommend the Portal bundle at USD$22.49 which includes Portal 1 and 2.\n\n[h1] [b] Rating [/b] [/h1]\nOverall: 7/10\n\n[h1] [b] Pros [/b] [/h1]\n- The slow-burn approach to the story.\n- The gameplay that refreshes the FPS genre.\n- The very detailed portal gun with excellent animations.\n- The emphasis of creativity in the levels.\n\n[h1] [b] Cons [/b] [/h1]\n- Length of campaign.\n- The simplicity in half of the levels. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Now if this was not done the right way, Portal could have been a very boring game, but since the innovation of the portals and glados and all the other highlights are added in, those things are going to get full attention from the player since nothing else is in focus since everything else is so bleak, which also why the escape sequence is so much fun, because you want to get out of this place and back outside That is fucking genius!!!

[/b]\n\nReleased in 2007, Portal was an FPS puzzle game developed by Valve. It quickly received critical acclaim for its unique, pioneering gameplay and darkly humoured tone. Set in the Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment centre, the player assumes the role of Chell, a test subject confined within the facility by the rogue AI, GLaDOS. \n\nThe game is separated into sequential test chambers which contain various puzzles and hazardous environments which you must navigate through using your hand held portal device. The device allows the player to create inter-spatial portals on level planes, creating visual and physical links between them. Two distinct portals (blue and orange) can be created at any one time in order to fashion an entrance and an exit through which the player and other environmental objects can travel through.\n\nAnother significant game mechanic is the concept of momentum being conserved through portals. Players and objects will exit portals with the same speed (and orientation) with which they entered them, allowing players to launch themselves great distances both vertically and horizontally.\n\nThe test chambers become increasingly more advanced and hazardous as the game progresses. Light combat elements are present, but you have no direct means of defending yourself. Instead, emphasis is placed on using portals in an evasive manner or as a way to deactivate enemies using environmental props.\n\nValve developed Portal alongside their Half-Life 2 series using the Source engine. The stark and often Spartan appearance of the test chambers were a conscious design choice to help players focus on the puzzles without distraction, but it also perfectly reflects the concept of a clinical laboratory setting. Despite this minimalist look, the game still looks graphically decent even by today\u2019s standards.\n\nPortal is very light on any form of plot and the story elements are very subtle, coming only from your interactions with GLaDOS and some hidden information caches. However, GLaDOS herself quickly becomes one of the most memorable aspects of Portal. Her script is full of sarcasm and a blatant disregard for your safety, which creates some genuinely humorous dialogue. GLaDOS\u2019 speeches almost become a reward in themselves for completing the puzzles you encounter.\n\nOne of the few criticisms that can be levelled at Portal is its length, as it can be comfortably completed in just a few hours. However, it is worth noting that you can unlock several advanced test chambers and additional challenge modes to boost gameplay time. These extra levels really display how Portal is a game which is relatively easy to learn but difficult to master. There is also a developer commentary mode which includes some tracks from Ellen McLain (voice of GLaDOS) if you are at all interested in the development process.\n\nOverall, Portal manages to seamlessly combine unique gameplay mechanics with an intuitive level design. It has a highly polished presentation which still looks good today. It is a genuinely innovative gameplay experience, which deserves every accolade it has collected.", "timestamp_created": 1495391120, "timestamp_updated": 1496066018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.762158215045928955", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48767660": {"recommendationid": "48767660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198881781751", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550377808}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this in in a bundle with portal 2 for 3$, which makes it my first purchase on steam.\n\n\nThis game is very epic", "timestamp_created": 1549345280, "timestamp_updated": 1549345280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765626251697540283", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47185255": {"recommendationid": "47185255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075117469", "num_games_owned": 363, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1415213310}, "language": "english", "review": "Portal and its sequel can be summarized in two words: Short and Sweet.\n\nRecommended.", "timestamp_created": 1543493107, "timestamp_updated": 1543493107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.762776017189025879", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31204936": {"recommendationid": "31204936", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302310186", "num_games_owned": 578, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504659932}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all this game needs to be listed among \"all fine-timers\"\nIt gives you a good brain run of problem solving,unimaginable funny dialogs, and lots of fun!\nBut it has is own cons and pros.\nPositive side:\n-Effective problem solving\n-Captions\n-Fast gameplay\n-Epic puzzles\n-Grapchics is just simply amazing!\n\nNegative:\n-Shortness\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1492454415, "timestamp_updated": 1492454415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.72262948751449585", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45273799": {"recommendationid": "45273799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026240050", "num_games_owned": 767, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 1013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475540033}, "language": "english", "review": "You've probably played Portal and Portal 2 already, but for those who haven't, oh boy, are you in for a treat.

Yep, they're gonna get a glowing recommendation from me. In my opinion, everyone should play these games, with the notable exception of people who hate puzzles. Even then, these could be the games that change your mind. \n\nBut lets say you know nothing about video games and haven't heard of Portal. Well, it's a puzzle game set as a first person shooter. That is, you see through the character's eyes. The unique idea behind this game is that you have a portal gun. You fire the gun at one wall and then another, and then a portal will form, connecting the two points, which you can then walk through. Using this simple but ingenious mechanic, the game has designed dozens of clever puzzles for you to solve.\n\nThe story behind the game is that you are a test subject in some bizarre maze-like facility run by a homicidal AI named GLaDOS. Now, despite the cool setting and great gameplay, what really elevates this game is the characters. There's only two, GLaDOS and, in the sequel, Wheatley. But despite the fact that the communication you have with these AI is completely one-sided, they absolutely make the game unforgettable. Their dialogue is movie quality, and funny as hell. In fact, GLaDOS has been voted one of the best video game villains of all time.\n\nI can't think of much else to say, other than buy these games, you won't regret it. 5/5 stars.", "timestamp_created": 1539556128, "timestamp_updated": 1539556128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758944153785705566", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "44128890": {"recommendationid": "44128890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109582894", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 1190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1539553322}, "language": "english", "review": "old but gold.", "timestamp_created": 1534198121, "timestamp_updated": 1534198121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.749049484729766846", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31736286": {"recommendationid": "31736286", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965346046", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494721657}, "language": "english", "review": "Yikes!

Work had been fun at first, and my boss had seemed nice and rather witty.  However after some time, my boss began acting strange.  It started with the lying.  Then, my boss began to intentionally make my work dangerous.  I survived, but only through quick thinking and a bit of luck.\n\nEventually the everyday grind of navigating my way through a neverending maze lost any appeal.  My boss promised me cake  when the job was completely done, but it wasn't worth it.  I wished for something, anything, even death, that would rid me from this meaningless existence.  I was tempted several times to walk infront of a turret or fall into the radioactive slime, but the pain these methods would bring seemed greater than the pain of a meaningless life, so I carried on.\n\nThen one day, my boss had a surprise for me.  He had brought me a Companion to assist me in my work.  Or more specifically, an Aperature Science Weighted Companion Cube.  At first, the Companion Cube assisted me with basic tasks which I nonetheless couldn't have done without it.  We rounded a corner and came face to face with a ball of radioactive energy coming straight towards us.\n\nI thought we were doomed, but then the Companion Cube jumped in front of me of its own accord and shielded me from certain death.  My mouth dropped, as I imagined the pain the Cube must have been experiencing.  My boss said something about \"symptoms of enrichment center testing\" and \"perceiving inanimate objects as alive\" but I paid no attention.  I knew this was love.  I knew this was real.\n\nWe continued on together for a while.  The Cube was essential in completeing the task my boss had set for me.  I tried talking to it, but I received no response.  My boss then oddly informed me that the Companion Cube would never threaten to stab me (as if it would ever)...but more importantly he informed me that my Cube was mute.  I felt a pang of sadness - not the selfish sadness one feels when they lose something, but the true sadness that is felt when empathizing with another being.\n\nThis revelation did not hamper my love for my Cube, my Companion, who had brought happiness and joy into my life, and who had selflessly endured pain to save me from death.  After opening the final door which would lead to the elevator I had grown quite familiar with, our boss seemed to congratulate us on our new found compaionship.  But then the bos said something which would change my life forever.\n\n\"However, [the Companion Cube] cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and, unfortunately, must be euthanized.  Please escort your Companion Cube to the Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator.\"\n\nI gasped in horror, looking across the room and seeing what I now realized must be the Incinerator.  I fell to my knees, tears already streaming down my cheeks.  I looked at my faithful Companion and proceeded to envelop it in my arms, determined to never let it go.\n\nMy boss continued on as if nothing was wrong.  \"While it has been a faithful companion, your Companion Cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test. If it could talk - and the Enrichment Center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot - it would tell you to go on without it because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you.\"\n\n\"You could never be a burden to me!\" I cried, and hugged my Companion Cube to my chest.  But then I remembered.  Although my boss had lied to be at one time, boss had since promised that he could no longer lie to me.  I had to finish the testing, or else I would never get the Cake.  And if the Cube couldn't come with me...didn't want to come with me...\n\nI hugged it one last time then picked myself up off the floor.  I walked slowly, hesitantly, toward the button that would open the incinerator.  It took more willpower than I've ever needed to press it.  Then I picked up my Companion and held it over the flames.  Tears clouded my vision and my hands began to sweat uncontrollably, and not just from the heat.  I held it there for what seemed like hours, just crying and admiring its beauty.  But then I remember the Cake.  And the Cube slipped from my hands.\n\n\"You euthanized your faithful Companion Cube more quickly than any test subject on record,\" said my boss.  \"Congratulations.\"\n\n11/10 would euthanize my Companion at the behest of my boss and all for a piece of cake again.", "timestamp_created": 1435008479, "timestamp_updated": 1435008479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 140, "votes_funny": 336, "weighted_vote_score": "0.798890769481658936", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22804008": {"recommendationid": "22804008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213866559", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489695306}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoy puzzle games, so I bought Portal expecting some puzzles, and that's exactly what i got.

So it all relies on your skill and brain power in order to escape Apature alive, while enjoying some cake for your victory... maybe. As the name states, the game is all about portals.

The modes outside of the main mode aren't very good, but if you're looking for a solid game that will take you a few hours to beat, this is the game for you.\n\n\tPortal is a game where you try to get from point A to point B by using different mechanics such as portals and cubes. The game does an outstanding job introducing its mechanics gradually, so that way the player isn't confused nor bored. The game's story, level design, mechanics, art design, and progression are amazing, however the alternate game modes (namely being the steps and time challenges) are a bit lackluster.\n\n[u] LEVEL DESIGN [/u]\n\n\tThe levels in Portal are simply amazing with everything in each level working together to bring the player a great experience. Everywhere the player needs to go is highlighted by an object or an art asset, so the player never feels lost. Even though this may seem hand-holding or too easy, the game will still leave enough puzzles to the player to add enjoyable gameplay with a large sense of satisfaction at the end of each puzzle. Some of the levels in the game have different shortcuts that only experience players will find. These shortcuts add replayability to the later few levels of the game, as the player will most likely not find all of the shortcuts in his or her first playthrough of the game.\n\n[u] MECHANICS [/u]\n\n\tPortal's mechanics are very consistent throughout the game, and compliment the level design. Portal does a great job of keeping the mechanics consistent so the player knows exactly what to do. For example, you cannot place portals on dark surfaces or metal throughout the entire game. All of the games mechanics interact with the level design to create a cohesive puzzle that is extremely entertaining. In the game, every time you see a large button, you know that there is a cube nearby, and the level does a nice job of explaining where the cube is. Also, in the earlier levels where momentum is needed to solve a puzzle, there is always an extended piston so the player knows where to place his or her's portal. The piston tells the player that momentum will be involved, so the level design and mechanics work well together.\n\n[u] ART DESIGN [/u]\n\n\tThe art design in Portal is very simplistic, which puts emphasis on the different aspects of each puzzle. It's very hard to get lost in Portal, because the puzzles stand out so much against their environment. In Portal, because everything is so simple, it gives the player a sense of \"Everything is here for a purpose.\" The art style also does a great job of telling a story. In the game, certain areas opt-out of using standard lights, and instead use these small rooms hidden behind opaque windows to give the player a feeling of being watched. The art design in Portal works really well with the gameplay and the theme.\n\n[u] ADVANCED MAPS [/u]\n\n\tThe advanced maps in Portal add a little bit more to the game, but I don't think they're anything to write home about. The advanced maps in Portal add obstacles, and remove shortcuts to the already existing levels to make them harder. I didn't spend much time with the advanced levels, as they're built on the same maps from the main game, because I feel the main game's maps are a lot more open with what way you solve the puzzle. Each advanced map has only one or two ways to solve the puzzle, whereas the main game of Portal has lots of different ways to solve each puzzle. Overall, I prefer when there are lots of ways to solve a puzzle as opposed to just having one way, so I didn't enjoy the advanced maps as much.\n\n[u] CHALLENGES [/u]\n\n\tIn Portal, there is a separate mode called \"Challenges.\" The challenge maps are the exact same maps from the main game, however you have a second goal, such as using the least number of portals, taking the least amount of steps, and completing the level as fast as possible. Completing each one of the later levels with the least amount of portals I found pretty clever and fun, but the other challenges have lots of problems. I found the least number of steps challenge to be ridiculous and unenjoyable. The mechanics needed to complete the level with a gold rating, I found to be pretty frustrating and irritating to pull off. Another issue with the steps challenge is Chamber 17. In Chamber 17, most of the level has nowhere to put a portal. Having nowhere to put a portal completely takes away from the challenge, and becomes an annoying game of timing each jump. The final challenge is the time challenge. In theory, this challenge should be pretty fun as it let's anybody try to be a speedrunner. However, for a few of the challenges, the time given to get gold is extremely low, and turns the challenge into constantly saving and reloading. This problem could easily be solved by giving the player a few more seconds to get gold. Overall, most of the challenges are not fun, but they do add lots of replay value as the player must try each challenge over and over again until he or she gets gold.\n\n[u] DEVELOPER COMMENTARY [/u]\n\n\tThe Developer Commentary in Portal is put together well, and is pretty interesting. If you're interested in the development of games, including art design, voice acting, and level design, then I recommend playing through the Developer Commentary.\n\nPortal as a whole is an amazing game, that has incredible level design. The game does have some problems in its other game modes, but the main game is still great. If you are even remotely into first-person games or puzzle games I strongly recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1485030569, "timestamp_updated": 1485030569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.656995236873626709", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32129840": {"recommendationid": "32129840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146944581", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496411990}, "language": "english", "review": "Best IQ tester", "timestamp_created": 1496412172, "timestamp_updated": 1496412172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.764038920402526855", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "41573582": {"recommendationid": "41573582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064946151", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 260, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549034212}, "language": "english", "review": "Portal is a true classic!

Portal 1 and 2 are the only puzzle games that I have played and enjoyed. That is high praise for I played many puzzle games and the Portal series are the only ones I liked. You play as a human test subject and try to complete puzzles with a portal gun. If you like puzzle games with a nice little story this is the game for you. There is a reason this game has overwhelmingly positive reviews. I suggest buying this on sale.\n\n[b] This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: [/b]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curation\n\nThis review is just my opinion.

Portal is a unique blend of the puzzle, FPS, and (to some extent) first-person platformer genres.\n\nThe game, for the most part, is a tutorial made into a full game.  This is, however, not a bad thing at all.  The game does its job exceptionally well to ensure the new mechanic, and namesake of the game, Portals, are taught to the player with little room for confusion.  This is an exceptional feat when Portals force players to think differently about the spaces around them, and how to traverse them.\n\nBesides enjoyable puzzles and interesting environments to explore, the game employs GLaDOS, effectively the narrator of the game, to serve as a means of adding dark comedy to the mix.  GLaDOS's unique sense of humor makes players want to continue through the game to discover both the secrets of the facility they wake up trapped within, and hear what witty remarks GLaDOS will say next.\n\nTo conclude, I would recommend Portal to any fans of puzzle games, as well as any fans of FPS or casual games.", "timestamp_created": 1438582610, "timestamp_updated": 1438582610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.66391676664352417", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "1110735": {"recommendationid": "1110735", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986992213", "num_games_owned": 2883, "num_reviews": 175, "playtime_forever": 786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1306652400}, "language": "english", "review": "Portal is one of the most fun games I have played in a long time. It is a combination of first person camera view with an almost pure puzzle solving game style which is an awesome combination in my opinion. \nThe events of Portal take place within the Half Life universe. During the game, you take control of Chell, who wakes up inside the Aperture Science Enrichment Center. You are informed by GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) that you will be participating in the testing of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. As you progress through the testing chamber, it becomes more readily apparent that all is not as it originally seemed.\nThe portal gun adds a whole new dimension to puzzle solving. All throughout the game, you are presented with situations that will seem near impossible to overcome. After some thought, it becomes clear how you can use the portal gun to solve the puzzle. As the game progresses,  the complexity of the puzzles increases and you often have to think two or three moves ahead in order to progress further.\nAfter you complete the game, two new modes, Challenge and Advanced, are unlocked. The Challenge mode forces players to solve the same puzzles again, but this time, with time or movement limits restricting them. Advanced mode simply ups the difficulty of puzzles by adding new obstacles and hazards.\nPortal is extremely short. It will take only a few hours to complete the whole game but the minimal time you will spend with the game, is well-worth the money.\n\nSounds 9/10\nGraphics 9/10\nGameplay 9/10\nAtmosphere 9/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation\n\nAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA", "timestamp_created": 1373978998, "timestamp_updated": 1489171234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.737017929553985596", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45561910": {"recommendationid": "45561910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086280475", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1541249063}, "language": "english", "review": "Now I know what \"the cake is a lie\" means. 10/10 best puzzle game I've ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1541078850, "timestamp_updated": 1541530499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694450080394744873", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34709277": {"recommendationid": "34709277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034979883", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 2341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546870201}, "language": "english", "review": "if you carry an active turret right behind the forcefield to GLADoS and let it shoot you, excess bullets hit GLADoS and she will literally drop all of her cores. just don't die", "timestamp_created": 1504438054, "timestamp_updated": 1504438054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668271303176879883", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39922686": {"recommendationid": "39922686", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961766540", "num_games_owned": 1309, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1355644800}, "language": "english", "review": "While it is on the short side, it is a quite engaging puzzle game with comedic elements", "timestamp_created": 1518065941, "timestamp_updated": 1518065941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633821547031402588", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26946900": {"recommendationid": "26946900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053851548", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1530043945}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily one of the best games I've ever played.

It's a game you'll no doubt hear about from anyone who says they play video games, at least if they're an adult anyway this game is old. Even though it's 10 years young portal still is one of the only video games which has it's main theme in the name of the game, you shoot portals, woopty doo. The story is one of the main reasons people like portal, and anyone who came from portal 2 probably bought this game from the orange box, or alone just for the lore. The lore goes along as you'd expect from a valve game after half life, mute people have problems too. Chell, our favorite unfortunate test subject, must go through all the tests from the infamous Glados. As you work your way through the game you get the feeling something is off very soon, with hints left by our favorite labrat.

If there's one complaint about Portal it's that, yes, it's a bit short even if for $10 but it's not like you aren't gettiing your entertainment/experience value and its chock full of special features for further insight if that's your sorta thing (it is to me!)\n\nOne complaint that might not bother others but sorta bothered me - again because I'm comparing it to 2 instead of vice versa - is that the game wastes no time piling complexity at you versus in #2 how it could often blend world building and exploration more frequently. It's a case of tight budgeting vs. free property reign but I feel it should be addressed.\n\nAll in all, Portal again cements Valve's rep at never offering inept neurally challenged games.
