But there are still plenty of missions available in base game, so not a big deal to me. Most characters, weapons and mods are also locked behind DLC, again, unobtainable for non-Ultimate Edition players. But Joy is available in the base game so I don't have a problem with it.\n\nWhat's good is that they put lots of effort in this game, huge amount of content, revamped skills, moddable weapons. Moddable game. Finally we can use female gangsters, and to customize our masks. The safehouse also added immersion into the game, makes you feel like you are really a member of a gang.\n\nBe warned there are plenty of cheaters in the game, they will use every cheats you can imagine, shooting explosives with every weapons, wallhack, flying in the sky, etc. People also kick and ban for various reasons, such as you don't have a specific build or being too low on rep.\n\nI still recommend getting this game if you liked PayDay: The Heist.

Is Payday 2 the best game? Absolutely not, but despite all the jank and the engine being garbage there was something in there that made me come back year after year until they finally finished the story around December last year. The biggest strength of Payday 2 if you ask me was the music, the gunplay and the heisters screaming their heads off every second plus the skill and gun customization that can drastically change how you play the game from heist to heist. The biggest weakness for this game was most definitely the Diesel Engine and how janky stealth is until you spend a decent chunk of time getting used to it and the team not having enough man power to properly balance the game, and Bo most likely telling them to work on new content on their crunch time all day every day. In the end it feels sad to say goodbye to this game despite all the jank and major issues it has, it still gave me fond memories and friends I still talk with. I can only hope whoever gets this IP knows what they are doing and have a decent understanding of what made Payday work. If you made it to the end I apologise for the huge wall of text since it's my first serious thing that I've wrote in a long time and I wanted to write this before I uninstall the game.

I got a bit salty after some of Overkill's actions and they have redeemed themselves for the most part, they still updated the game during 2018 with free heists and returning heists from PDTH.[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Updated: November 23rd, 2016[/h1]\n\nThey introduced some changes, like two new difficulties, and other free content to the community. Looks like after the turmoil last year they are back on track trying to improve the game. The new difficulties seem rushed, there aren't a lot of viable builds. Questionable DLC business model is still up. Actually it's more challenging and fun to play with the vanilla and free community weapons. The problem with DLCs are the paid heists, you need them if you want to host those heists, but you can still join lobbies if you don't own these. The problem will be finding those lobbies.\n\n\n\n[h1]Updated: June 6th, 2016[/h1]\n\nSome things have changed, and others did not. OVERKILL removed the paid safes/drills from drop rotation, although you can still open them if you buy a drill, so they kept the microtransactions. They are changing it in the near future though, so new safes will drop and users will be free to open them, or sell them on Steam Market. I have no problem with that, as long as it keeps accessible for everyone without a pay wall.\n\nThey also changed/updated the game with some free content since my last review update, and few other paid DLCs.\n\nIt seems they are launching less DLC but the paid DLC model has not changed though, they still keep releasing themed DLC split in two packs, like the Biker Heist and Biker Character Pack, those could easily be a single pack. At least they will keep supporting the game until 2017, which is definitely a good thing. Users decide if they want to buy DLC or not, but lets hope the quality is good. Buy it on sale, on the cheap :)\n\n\n\n\n\n[h1]Update: After Black Market Update 79 / October 15th, 2015[/h1]\n\nOVERKILL introduced new microtransactions with random safe card drops and drills and weapon skins, equivalent to CS:GO weapon cases and keys and skins with steam market support, also similar to a model of free-to-play games. The difference is that PD2 is a paid game and those skins actually boost some stats.\n\nAdding microtransactions was something they said they never would do.\nDeveloper can't keep their word:\n[i]...We've made it clear that PAYDAY 2 will have no micro-transactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!) and... [/i]\n> http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3127521\n\nThey launched a \"weapon rebalance\" patch with the excuse to increase diversity and versatily of other weapons. The thing is, with some stats being nerfed and stats boost added to skins, seems like a clear move from them to incite people buying those skins.\n\nPistols making more damage than heavy shotguns and assault rifles. What is this nonsense? To bring some shotguns back to their level before the \"rebalance patch\" you have to use special ammo, that is a feature of Gage Shotgun Pack, a DLC that wasn't required now is.\n\nIn the process of updating their game, popular mods were killed because OVERKILL made changes on how the game worked with LUA modification scripts. OVERKILL claims that breaking mods was not intentional. [strike]But how can you trust someone's word if they went back on it already? Call it conspiracy theory but maybe they just wanted to protect their new investment (microtransactions) to prevent malicious scripts from tampering with the game and finding a way to get easy safe card drops. Now it's gonna take a lot of unpaid effort from modders to get things working again, or maybe those mods will be just dead.[/strike]\n\nMods are in the process of being fixed. Several of them are working again. Unfortunately some good modders got disgusted by recent OVERKILL choices and abandoned their mods :(\n\n\n[h1]Old/first review[/h1]\n\nVery good game to play Co-Op with friends. Even playing with random people can be fun. Playing solo is usually not fun (I think solo play is suitable for stealth), but it's not the idea of the game. Some heists you can go loud or stealth, which renders a unique course as the heist takes place, or you can even do some of the heist in stealth and the rest loud. Could have more missions although they have some variation from time to time, It's a good thing that the developer is always launching new patches with improvements and bug fixes.\n\nSince the Death Wish patch, despite adding a new difficulty and some particular changes to the heists some aspects of the game were changed. Some of those changes modified the way certain skills worked and how they were implemented, and the most dramatic change was to the Stealth mechanics. I think those changes balanced the game better, in some ways it made the game more challenging, The new stealth mechanics requires more situational awareness and avoiding detection, it's not \"bad\", it works well for some heists but it makes luck to play a bigger part in other heists. I enjoy both Stealth and the Full assault gameplay but I enjoyed the \"old stealth\" because it was more simple and less time consuming, waiting and luck played lesser parts.\n\nSince my initial review there was a good amount of new heists added, some in free updates, most in paid updates (DLC). Despite heist DLCs most DLC packs are for weapons, masks, materials and characters. Missing some optional content isn't game breaking, but the DLC are too many and there are small things that could certainly be already in the game like a sniper rifle, light machine gun, grenades, more good weapon mods: all this was included behind a paywall (DLC), which is not nice. Also some DLC make the game somewhat easier, which feels that it's a bit of a \"pay to make it easier\" DLC.\n\nAfter so many hours playing I still enjoy playing with friends, so I still enjoy the game, although it's a bit tiresome to play the same heists over and over, so I tend to play only the Death Wish difficulty which still puts some challenge. The Infamy system is useful until Level 5 because it discounts the number of points you have to spend to unlock higher skills in the skills tree, so you can make better builds spending less points. Beyond that it's just more grinding for a few masks, materials and patterns.\n\nI don't like the random card/loot system that awards you items or masks, even useless money or little EXP boosts, I think it should be reworked. The rewards should be more balanced so everyone feels rewarded playing every single heist.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n+ Great Co-Op fun with friends!\n+ There is some variety of heists, but it becomes tiresome after many hours playing over and over the same maps\n+ Stealth or Full assault option on most situations\n+ The developer is present and tries to update the game with good frequency\n+ The new stealth adds a new challenge and situational awareness\n+ Good range of skills. You can specialize or make good builds depending on your role in the heists\n+ Many weapons are available and can be modified, although some are DLC exclusive, but I have to say that most weapons I use are those included in the game and community updates.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n- \"New stealth\" is more waiting game in certain situations than really a matter of being skilled.\n- The Infamy system is too much grinding for little reward\n- The rewards (loot system) should be rebalanced and reward the player more with more rare items\n- DLCs are too many, some things could be already in the full game or included for everybody. At this point all the DLC together cost way more more than the original game.\n- Some weapon and character perk deck DLC make the game easier in certain ways, which unbalanced compared to the original free loadout of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1444946057, "timestamp_updated": 1542849926, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 485, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.69745481014251709", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18491937": {"recommendationid": "18491937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049204473", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 23405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1541995234}, "language": "english", "review": "Payday 2 is a fantasticly fun game, which gets even more enjoyable with friends.

I was willing to put up with the terrible desynch and the gradual powercreep because it was fun, and as a cooperative game, it wasn't a huge problem.\n\nHowever, recently they added CS:GO-style \"weapon crates\" that you get randomly for completing heists. Opening them requires you spend real money. Inside, you get weapon skins, which give stat bonuses to your weapons.\n\nThey added this feature as the first \"free\" reward the community got for completing a bunch of milestones during the run-up to the yearly Crimefest. Literally, \"Well done on the challenges, your free reward is an opportunity to give us more money and make the game pay-to-win.\"\n\nBasically, fuck Overkill.

Any of that happen in the past 2 years? No.  Have they STATED anything about any of those? Nope.\n\nNot to mention the APPAULING DLC that they keep putting out and saying it's \"New content\" when all they put out is weapons and anything that is a actual level is boring as heII.  It's basically saying \"We're too lazy to make anything new so have more weapons.\"\n\nNow then, onto the MAIN issue that they just put out, but lets start by going over why OTHER games do this (TF2, CSGO.) and do it the right way, Overkill completely misses it.\n\nTalk about a copy paste job, it's just basically this for those of you wanting to know the jist http://i.imgur.com/6tXBcEf.gifv Oh, should I add that they litterally did the same thing with a CSGO map? Yeah, lazyness to a whole new level. Want something better that fits them to a T? This https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bdYRBDMJpI\n\n\"The Steam page for PAYDAY 2 has been updated based on your feedback. WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT PAYDAY 2 WILL HAVE NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS WHATSOEVER\" Please tell me you f*%sticks over at Overkill are joking with this? Talk about hypocrits.\n\n1) The way CSGO and TF2 do it = These games do it right, you are not required to buy any skins at all, they prove no stat boost, no promises on getting more kills, ammo, anything, it's purely cosmetic, you aren't even forced to get any at all, and they don't shove it in your face.  The way Overkill does it, you can only get a 'safe' from a card drop, and the only way to open that safe is if you pay money for a drill, and you're set on a RNG based kind of system.  \"Oh that's just like CSGO though!\" Not really, in CSGO you can get drops for FFFFFF*%KING FREEEEEEE, and they don't change anything, just make it look better, unless it's a StatTrak I suppose.  Plus any skin you get you can sell for Steam Currency to buy better skins, or save them up and trade them all in for a random skin that is one rank higher than the colors you gave the Trade.  \"Oh you don't want the crate?\" CSGO would say, \"Well just go sell it on the market and get something that you'd like instead!\" Payday = \"Oh you don't want the safe? Don't have any money for the drill? Tough s*%t, bltch.\"\n\n2) The skins in Payday 2 ruin the stats = They've made it to where skins give weapons boosts, my question is, why? That kind of ruins the entire point of all of that stats, you may as well just get a certain gun that kills people the most out of all the guns you've ever used in the game, get a particular skin, and that's it, why bother using anything else? I think they should scrap this entirely, make the skins be drops, or better yet, why not just GET RID OF THEM, and oh, I don't know, MAKE SOME ACTUALY LEVELS?! INSTEAD OF CASH GRABBING FROM YOUR FANS?!\n\n3) *off topic kind of* All of the Moderators are now SJW = Apparently since practically THE WHOLE S%DDING COMMUNITY HATES THIS, the moderators have now flat out gotten rid of everyones posts that seemed negative in any way, instead of, oh, I don't know, TAKING IT AS F*#KING CRITICISM?! That's reaching a whole new low people, don't get rid of it, LEARN FROM IT.  I'm actually WITH the community on this, they hate it, I hate it and I don't even PLAY THE DAMN GAME ANYMORE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, and I'm with the community on this.\n\nEnding = Why people actually defend this game anymore is seriously beyond me, I haven't touched it in months, will I come back to it?  F*%k if I know, at the rate they're going probably not, especially since it gets incredibly boring after a while, I might come back here and there, but not like I used to.  It's ridden with bugs, pointless DLC padding, and now this boIIocks, stay far away, maybe if they get their head out of their a$$ and bring out more free stuff instead of this garbage then maybe you should get it, but untill then, me, and even my friends that play it, advise you to stay away from this garbage.\n\nFight for your games and how they should be made, why is this such a bad thing?  Quit letting developers run you, instead MAKE THEM do the game correctly, don't make people like Overkill turn into EA, push them back, demand MORE from them, not less, this is the reason this s*%t happens, fight against it!  Make this turn out like Deus Ex Mankind Divided, make them regret this stupid decision that they did, make them admit that they f*%ked this up.  Even though I don't enjoy the game anymore at all, I at least want the people that DO to have some respect from Overkill. Here Overkill, this is for you http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/635/465/29b.gif\n\nEdit: Their final day, and guess what they added, a jump animation.  Really? That's, it? It's not even client sided it's based off of other players, there is litterally, no difference.  That's your guys' BIG ending to this? A jumping animation? That does absolutely nothing?

You didn't fix known bugs because you were too busy adding new DLC, and new enemies that were unfair WITHOUT DLC, and I tried to ignore it. I loved this game, I really did, and I played it to virtually no end, even at one point abandoning Team Fortress 2 for it. \"Weapon packs\" that contribute nothing just kept pouring in and in and in, with nothing useful to add, just one gimmick weapon to grab people's attention in the hopes that they'd buy the \"Wacky\" item, and I tried to ignore it. I got over the fact you never bothered programming Cloakers properly, and that they're happy to kick you from the ground floor on Rats whilst you're on the roof if they can't think of a way to path to you. Desync was never so much as acknowledged after an initial \"Patch\" that vaguely improved it whilst drop-in joining, even though a community mod (PocoHUD) addresses the issue perfectly well, and I got over it. Refusal to add limb hitboxes because they'd be \"Too much unnecessary work\" when one man took one afternoon off and implemented them himself was pushing it, but I STILL got over it. Your treatment of loyal fans on Twitter, e.g. the fan who called you out for not caring about the console version and got the response of \"IF I LOVED A GAME ID BUY IT ON PC\" (As though anyone would care enough to buy this mess after that sort of treatment) I resented, but I played on regardless. The Hype Train, a pay-to-enter version of a previous free event, that provided us with an advertisement for a future pay-for DLC and an enemy that's virtually immortal without DLC, that makes it near impossible for armour players to play the game their way I tried and tried to ignore, but the fact that people paid millions collectively to see an ad got under my skin. When you failed to deliver on an enemy you presented TWO YEARS AGO and didn't start development for until the beginning of 2015, and instead just made it a hyper-powerful version of an already existing enemy (That of course is weak as a kitten if you use DLC-only explosives), that deploys with what is essentially a small troop of copies of itself I was disgusted. The FBI files, a long-awaited addition to the game, turned out to be a link to Overkill's own website that plays a cute little \"Virtual machine\" that shows you gun statistics, something there's already a Wiki for, as well as the character's profiles and backgrounds, something you could already see on crimenet in game. And I took a break, and figured I'd get over it eventually. I'd come back, I'd play again. I played this game to the point where I could beat Death Wish solo on loud heists, so surely I'd pull through thick and thin and return to the game with open arms. Right?\nAnd then Overkill lost it.\nThe game now has CS:GO's uncrating system. They clearly noticed Gun Mettle was a huge success in Team Fortress 2 and decided their community would love the same thing. Small problem with this theory, however: Team Fortress 2 already had an item system, and hundreds upon thousands of cosmetics that could customise your characters to however you wanted them to be. Payday had nothing of this sort, so this comes across as a blatant cash-in on an idea that worked for another game. But that's fine. Even if they stole the idea right down to the dot on the I (Or the inspect animations in this instance), it worked for CS:GO, it wasn't as bad as anyone with over 15 hours thought it was going to be in TF2, maybe it'll work for Overkill, despite their weapons being awarded via a level system and changing appearances based on what attachments and customisations you apply to the weapons. And if that were it, I'd say \"I really hate this company but whatever\" and resign myself to just playing.\nBut no, that's not all. The weapon skins give statistical advantages. These give upgrades in stats compared to the base skins. And there's NO other way to get them, save for opening them with a [strike]key[/strike]drill, straight from the community marketplace. You HAVE to spend money, REAL money, not the two billion you have sitting in your offshore account with no purpose since they lied about safehouse customisation, but actual currency on your Steam account, to get these weapons, and by not shelling out extra money that already costs (Or so I've been informed, not a US resident) around 25$, you are at a disadvantage to other players who WILL do so, because Overkill wanted to profit that much more off an update TF2 did for free, which was successful because of the rebalancings. Congrats, Overkill. I know I'm not the only person you'll have heard this from, but you're true filth, and I took great pleasure in uninstalling. DON'T buy this game. All you'll do is have your arm twisted until you relent and buy an ever-expanding list of DLC, and now apparently some pretty gun skins, or else the game is insultingly difficult (On Death Wish, all other difficulties are easy regardless, because why would \"Overkill\", the fourth difficulty setting with only one above it, pose a challenge, and stealth is always easy just for what it is). The game is disgusting, and never content with the amount of cash it's sucked in, and broken beyond repair. But don't expect it to be fixed. That'll cost you extra.\nBrief update, significantly late: The microtransactions have been (Mostly) retracted.

The game makes constant demands on its players for more money in the form of DLC which brings a noticeable power creep in, despite the fact that the game had made its money back in just pre-orders.\n\nIt is a four-player co-op shooter that pits a team of four players against a swarm of AI-controlled police. If you're familiar with Left 4 Dead's model of swarms of weak enemies with a scattering of stronger enemies with special abilities, that's the model Payday 2 went with. As you level your character up though, you get new abilities, and you acquire new weapons to fight with.\n\nMask customization is probably the highlight of the game, with there being an enormous collection of masks, materials for them to be \"made\" out of, patterns to put on them, and colors for those patterns to be. You can make some really fun stuff, play a lot, and never see anyone wearing not just the same mask you're wearing but any mask in your collection.\n\nThat said, while anyone who finds fun in doing the same reasonable enjoyable missions over and over again will find some fun here, I cannot recommend the game.\n\nFirst off, for gameplay reasons: in Overkill, probably the most popular difficulty because lower difficulties are insultingly easy and the higher difficulty is really quite hard without good teamwork, the most common grunt enemy can only be hurt with headshots. If you're the kind of player who likes to optimize his gear, and the game gives you the tools to do that, there are only a few break points for damage against this enemy. What you'll end up doing is designing a weapon that can kill this enemy in two headshots while still being as accurate and stable in rapid-fire as possible (unless you go with a marksman rifle or a shotgun, in which case killing with a single headshot is easily attainable).\n\nThis means that despite there being dozens of weapons in each category, you can easily narrow each category down to one or two \"best\" guns, and the others are only there if you're comfortable with using a weapon you know is weaker than what you can be using.\n\nThen, of course, there are the business practices of Overkill. The game was profitable based on pre-orders alone, and while free content and map packs are added, so is a lot of cheap cash-in DLC that often includes pay-to-win mechanics: at first you needed DLC to have grenades, now you need DLC to have the powerful molotov cocktails, and a separate DLC for the useful ninja stars. Do you want the best gun possible? Then you need to buy the mod pack DLC.\n\nEven content that was supposed to be free and given as a reward to the fans has seen money coming in for the game: John Wick was added to the game as a playable heister, supposedly as an announced reward for getting enough members into the community group but actually because he was being used as a paid advertisement for the movie he was in. Another heist features and is named after a real life musical performer.\n\nMost recently as a \"reward\" for completing challenges ahead of Crimefest, Payday 2 was given a crate/key system just like in CS:GO, where as a \"thanks\" to the community now a portion of your post-heist loot drops will only be usable if you spend real money on a \"drill\" to open it, where it will then give you a random weapon skin that, just like with the DLC, makes your weapon stronger.\n\nIs there fun to be had? Sure. But there are other games out there that are just as fun, but have developers who think of their players as more than just wallets.

You can spend half an hour playing normal when all of a sudden a dozen of special enemies charge and immobilize your whole crew. But it's more likely that you won't play the game that long 'cause it will crash.\nThe way developers update the game and the frequency of those updates is nonsensical. Each update makes even top PC struggle, making it straight unusable for an hour or more which forced me to delete the game and redownload the whole thing every time update occurs. And with 100+ major updates and hundreds of \"hotfixes\" (and most updates turn the game into bug infested mess) it became the most annoying thing I've experienced in videogames.

We were promised free updates for crimefest. Emphasis on \"FREE\"? And what was the first thing we get? First of all, we got a weapon rebalance, which was threatened to never occur unless we did the rediculous road to crimefest challenges. But now? F**KING. CRATES. That's right, CRATES. Like TF2, and CS:GO. Overkill's greed has no bounds, their supposed 'free' update, is nothing but a gimmick laced with micro-transactions.\n\n Now, I loved Payday, as you could discern by my playtime. But this? This is just the mark of a bad company trying its most to squeeze every little cent out of its player base. They do so little to ever improve the actual game. There are game-breaking bugs still present that have been in since day 1. And insted of fixing them, they push more content, begging for money. \"Well it's just a change, you'll get over it.\" No, not this time. This is where I draw the line. This is where I say, no more. I'm never spending another cent on this game. This single update has literally sapped all the fun I could have out of it. Good job Overkill. You've killed your franchise for one more player. Maybe when you're sinking, you can look back and atleast realize how and where you f**ked up. I may reconcider were they to withdraw the fact you have to PAY for the 'special drills' (keys) to open their 'safes' (crates).\n\n And guess what? They won't ever do that. Overkill never backs out of ANYthing. And no matter how much the player-base hates it, there'll be enough people who'll eat it up to keep Overkill afloat, and that's all that matters to them. Screw 80% of the community when we only need 20% to survive, right? During crimefest, they were hardpressed to actually get 30,000 people online at once. They had to make an announcement for it. The game is dying, and they're doing nothing to help it other than trying to make that last few cents before it does.\n\n >Edit<\n And here we had day 2... Nothing short of a JOKE. We get some crappy masks? ONLY masks? And not just that, FIVE WHOLE CHALLENGES. WERE DEDICATED. TO. MASKS?? It should tell you something that this game's reviews SWEPT red over night. It dropped a whole 10% in approval ratings within 24 hours of announcing the blackmarket, and another 4% before writing this review (It has over 140,000 reviews. That's a lot of people changing their minds.)  And WOW. Nobody's screwed up this bad in a single update since Valve and Bethesda tried to charge cash for mods, and guess what? They LEARNED from that mistake. This was a great chance for Overkill to save SOME face but instead they spit in ours. I hold my breath on what kind've disappointment Day 3 holds.\n\n >Edit edit<\n And here we are, Day 6. Overkill finally buckled and added in drills as card drops. Or so they say, I've yet to see a single, even MISSED card, as this fabled 'Wolf Card'. Good job setting the drop-rate lower than an infamous mask. Nothing else has been changed, and this is hardly a comprimise.\n\n>Edit edit edit<\n So Crimefest has come and went, and while it COULD have been good. The fact it was poisoned by the blackmarket update remains. The additions of old heists is pretty cool. But really? What did we get other than that? A lot of masks nobody could care for? An update to the AI and Crime.net that SHOULD have already been in the game? ONE new gun and a really buggy new tripod mechanic, that shows little to no actual value of use on anything over normal difficulty due to specials and their incap abilities. A jump animation update that doesn't even look good? We got new masks, new achievements, and a new TRAILER, all revolving around jump animations, are you serious? What else did we get?\n\n Oh yes, let me write it out. I'd hate to touch on things I already have, but it's been nearly a week since I touched this review.\n\n Microtransactions - We already had to pay 20-30 dollars for the game. Then they ask for 100+ dollars for DLC. Now this, a mechanic literally ripped out of CS:GO. Do you know what skins are? They're a mod. You know how before, we'd get around 4 weapons, maybe 4 masks, and some assorted mods for a 5 dollar pack? Now they're asking for 2.50 for ONE weapon mod. Oh it's not the one you want? TOO BAD! Go gamble some more.\n\n Broken Promises - Former head of Overkill said there wouldn't be any. Current head of Overkill said there wouldn't be any. And what did we get? We got them anyway... Where's the safe house customization that was promised BEFORE release? Where's the COMPLETELY OVERKILL SPECIAL ITEM, for those of us who baught that pack? Who supported you when you asked for it, and then you sh*t on us? It took over a year to develop the FBI files, and what was it? A WEBSITE. ONE LITERALLY STOLLEN FROM THE PAYDAY STATS GUY. It took over a year to develop the new Gensec enemy, and it was the laziest f**king thing, literally just shields mushed together. The driving mechanics were promised to be fixed, and they're still wonky as hell. We still have major desync issues. But those can wait when you have a new 5-7 dollar DLC pack to push out right?\n\n One p**sed off community - The game's Steam approval rating has dropped about 23% since the update was introduced, and it's only on a steady decline from here. Do I need to say more? That's around 35,000+ people of the current 160,000+ reviewers, or have either made a new review like me or changed their old ones. Overkill claims to always have open ears to the community but it's clear they don't give a crap what we think.\n\n>Edit x4<\n\n So I got word the COP item was released. But before we get to that, I'd like to point out Overkill announcing the Charity thing just after crimefest ended. I don't know of this was just really well timed, or they're attempting to cover their as*es, with the 'it's for the Children!' routine, but from how Overkill treated us so far, I'm guessing the latter.\n\nANYway, the COP item finally came out and /WOW/. It's nothing but another. F**king. Crate. A 20 dollar crate. Really guys? Took you the better part of a year to come up with that one, did it? We get a random weapon skin from it as usual. It's completely random with no say over what it is. It's not even gurenteed a good quality. Needless to say, the community is back up in arms over this, as they should be. It's apparently gotten so bad, the forum moderators have quit since Overkill is physically incapable of learning a simple lesson. The item in the COP safe was promised to be cosmetic only, yet apparently comes with more stat boosts than any other skin thus far. (If I've read this right, forgive any misinformation as I've stopped caring about this flustercluck of a game since October.) They've claimed the sales are doing what they want, so I assume their whole goal was to get 50,000 people hating them. Oh sorry, we're the 'vocal minority' so we don't matter. (The game at any given time has about 20k people playing it at most. I'm pretty sure doubling that takes us out of the 'minority' range.)", "timestamp_created": 1444938944, "timestamp_updated": 1447876979, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 103, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562743008136749268", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18490917": {"recommendationid": "18490917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073403472", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 218399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "last_played": 1550757981}, "language": "english", "review": "After almost 1600 hours, buying every DLC up to Alesso full price, on release, I can now say, I no longer support or even like Overkill.

The long, objective-rich campaigns had enough variety between them that the game never felt stale. Gunplay was satisfying, enemies were challenging, and the DLC added a new class to screw around with. A few maps and secrets got updated as free updates.\n\nPayday 2 is nothing like the first game.\n\nThe sequel is essentially a disgrace to the first game. In lieu of lengthy, interesting campaigns, each assignment has been broken up into a bunch of smaller maps with straightforward objectives. Prepare to see the same areas, again and again. Stealth has been overemphasized across the board--killing yourself to restart is a common occurrence. The difficulty just isn't there compared to the first game, either. The matchmaking is also random gen and a complete mess--gone are the easy lobbies of the first game.\n\nIt gets worse! The unlock system is heavily dependent on RNG. Customization is RNG. Everything in this game is RNG except leveling.\n\nThe game has had DLC after DLC heaped on it. During a sale, it becomes a reasonable price.. when it's off sale expect to pay $50+ just to unlock a decent amount of content.\n\nThe game has blatant product placement. John Wick is shoved in your face as a free character. Why this doesn't get more negative feedback, I'll never know.\n\nThe new DLC came free of charge.. with a caveat. Now you can enjoy CS:GO and Team Fortress 2 crates, and pay $2.50 to unlock them. As if the game couldn't become more money-grubbing and obsessed with profit. Did I mention the crates are factored into the RNG loot, meaning if you have no intent to pay to unlock them, you can still lose out by getting them when you don't want them?\n\nGame use to have a modding community, too. Overkill has deliberately broken mods with their latest patch. Maybe they'll fix this, I don't know.\n\nAm I against all DLC? Not at all. Plenty of games make great use of DLC. But herein lies my point. This is not a free-to-play game. This isn't a game in which the DLC is cosmetic. You have to pay for the game. Then the DLC, which encompasses characters, weapons, and campaigns, is also paid for. The game has product placement blatantly inserted into it.

Not to mention the issues it will get you into. Things like getting tazed by Tazers which you can't even see on your screen or cloakers running and pouncing through walls / being stuck in the same spot for a while instead of actually moving and chasing the player actively when they are meant to.\n\nAnother example would be the Hotline Miami heist which causes framedrops for quite a few players. Almir briefly mentioned that they were going to look into it but nothing ever happened.\n\nGuess what? Same thing with the Infamy 2.0 update which was promised to be more than just cosmetics. It contains nothing but masks and EXP boosts which makes it look like it was rushed after the community complained a lot about the non existent release of Infamy 2.0 on the forums. Almir said they were going to look into it \"once the dust settled\" and we haven't heard anything about it ever since.\n\nThe release of DLCs just kept getting worse. We're getting new bugs with every DLC which are partially claimed to be features instead of fixing them like the Molotovs which used to take down the armor of Swat Turrets instantly if you were the host of the game and only then. It has been (ab)used for cross promotion (e.g. John Wick, Hotline Miami, Speedrunners, Humble Bundle, Chivalry Medieval Warfare etc.), becoming more expensive and frequent while having less content which also got worse in terms of quality and balancing with each DLC . \nThe optimization of the latest DLC map releases have been an issue as well causing many players to have stutters and framedrops even with relatively high end rigs like mine.\nWe also had a DLC called \"The completely Overkill pack\" which was a time limited offer and thought of as a donation: it included 4 masks as well as a secret ingame item which has yet to be released.\nThe Game of the Year edition contains 16 of 27 paid DLCs for Payday 2 right now. Do not get fooled by the fact that they added free DLC releases to the cart.\n\nThey used the Payday 2 forums to tease us for 35 days straight with content which does not even belong to the game itself, as it was revealed afterwards. All of the content is tied to another game which was not going to be released for at least another 2 years (Overkills The Walking Dead).\n\nThere was a Hype Train event which basically forced us to buy DLCs for fuel to complete all of the goals which turned out to be just another cross promotion. One of the goals was a tournament which was supposed to have a price of $250000. It is still unknown what the tournament is or was, who participated and who actually won these $250000.\n\nSafehouse customization -a feature which has been promised to be included for the release of the game- still hasn't made it into the game 2 years after the release of Payday 2.\n\nFor the first Crimefest we were promised a new enemy and FBI Files which took them an entire year to develope. They were released shortly before the second Crimefest was announced. The new enemy is underwhelming even though he comes with interesting and unique mechanics. The FBI Files are basically the same thing that PD2Stats used to be; the website of PD2Stats was shut down thanks to that. I'd like you to take a look at the [url=http://www.pd2stats.com]PD2Stats[/url] site to read the story about all of this yourself now.\n\nThe latest addition of Overkill Software at day 1 of the second Crimefest -which is celebrating the fourth birthday of the Payday franchise- are microtransactions. Almir himself as well as David Goldfarb said that there would NEVER be any microtransactions in Payday 2 in the past.\nProof:\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/24240/discussions/0/810924774517838925/#c810925398555174856]Proof #1[/url]\n[url=http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3127521]Proof #2[/url]\n[url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-wont-have-microtransactions/1100-6410303]Proof #3[/url]\nThe community has been working hard for 16 days to finish challenges and unlock content which was promised to be free for everyone during the Crimefest itself.\nThey basically added the exact same system that can be found in Counter-Strike:Global Offensive from the colour of the quality of the weapons to the weapon inspection animation itself. Some of these skins will even change the stats of the weapons. Apparently they are coming together with a pre defined set of weapon mods which can not be changed or replaced.\nThe Safe drops will replace your regular card drops which are supposed to get you weapon mods, masks, materials, colours and patterns. These Safes might even contain skins for DLC weapons you do NOT own.\nA single drill costs 2,49\u20ac right now which is about half of the cash you would spend on most DLCs if they are not on sale (4,99\u20ac) and twice as much as they cost right now with a discount of 75% (1,24\u20ac).\nAll of this led most of the veteran players to quit playing or even delete the entire game, as well as forum Mods censoring / deleting entire threads which were written and discussed in a civilized manner just as the mods asked for.\nThey even openly admit that they're actively censoring the forums. \n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/218620/discussions/8/490123197943804165]Proof[/url]\n\nPersonally I don't feel like a game which costs about 20\u20ac and comes with additional DLC worth about 110\u20ac should be using any microtransaction system at all; the DLCs are more than enough as it is. Yes i've bought almost all of the DLCs for the full price including the Completely Overkill Pack except for the last 2 or so.\n\nThey disabled the LUA hook which is required to run certain mods at day 1 of the second Crimefest too. Whether or not it's related to some mods crashing the game once it gets updated or the fact that some mods are skins / give us an ability to \"create\" skins like GoonMod is up to you and your conspiracy theories. \nMy very own mod_override skins for the Black and Skull Dozer are still working however.", "timestamp_created": 1445025827, "timestamp_updated": 1445303992, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 192, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835193395614624023", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18490382": {"recommendationid": "18490382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055887191", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 84426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471090377}, "language": "english", "review": "The developer has just introduced weapon skins that can be found in random crate drops that cost $2.50 each to unlock.

The captain arrive on the map, stop moving, and lock the wave!( you have to defeat him for the police assault to stop) He is surrounded by other shield! And guess what ? The best way to defeat him is Molotov Cocktail(BBQ pack DLC). But they are balancing the game around base content....\n\nOverkill said that after crimefest they would be more transparent...But ..... They said they would listen to the community too! Oh yeah Almir now create thread in the forum !

Now with the introduction of the free crimefest event that was about reaching community set in-game goals they took the cake though.\nOverkill introduced a skin system similar to what csgo has, not only are the key prices too high, but the skins will actually affect your gameplay now giving you statistic boosts to your weapons. e.g making them more accurate/powerful.\n\nI simply cant by any means support this business decision and will leave this game a negative review until we get an official statement by overkill adressing this issue.\n\nI am aware of the hours I put into this game and as I said i had a lot of fun with it and I will most likely continue playing, but cant with a good heart continue supporting this company if this is the direction they're going.\n\nI would advise new players to stick to the vanilla game which offers enough great and fun hours with friends, but dont support this decisionmaking by overkill.\n\nCheers.\n\nEdit: After a long time I've decided to check up on payday again and see where it stands now and what happened since the crimefest fiasco.\n\nTo my surprise it seems like overkill caved under the pressure the community put on them and revamped the system properly.

Several representatives of Overkill claimed that Payday 2 would not include micro-transactions. One such represenative said that it would \"never\" happen.

Moral of story: Never buy Overkill products and never trust their word for it is worthless.\n\nFurthermore, independent sources claim that Overkill have taken an axe to the modding community in the same update, even mods \"approved\" by Overkill such as HoxHud, by supposedly removing the LUA Hook required to make mods work. If true, such is certainly not the way to thank a community for their dedication to improving a game over a prolonged period of time.\n\nFinally, that Overkill would have the effrontery to do both of the above things as a \"reward\" for completing community challenges in the Road To Crime Fest Event shows complete and utter contempt for the Payday 2 community. Keeping in mind that the Road to Crime Fest Event is all about celebrating the anniversary of Payday: The Heist - which is ironically micro-transaction free.

This is a step in the right direction, but in my opinion there are still a lot of wrongs that need to be righted before I can recommend the game.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nMy friend, Doctor Insano, said it better than I could...\n\nSo here's the thing. I have 2,000 hours in this game. I have a Youtube channel of me doing Death Wish heists solo without bots. I did the Tabula Rasa challenge solo without bots, unmodded weapons, before Grinder. You could say I loved this game at one point.\n\nThat time is gone. Overkill has repeatedly broken promises. They directly said before release \"We will not ever have microtransactions.\" And yesterday, October 15, 2015, they added Microtransactions. This game is not Free to Play with microtransactions. This game is not cheap with microtransactions. This game has a reasonably priced base game with $100 of DLC. In order to purchase this game with all DLC, you must pay $130 outside of a sale. On top of this $130 price tag are microtransactions. Just...think about that. The price of this game alone is more than the price of two AAA games. Overkill then has the audacity to TRIPLE DIP on this by adding microtransactions.\n\nLast year, there were a series of \"what's next\" audio files hinting at something. After a *month* of daily audio files being released, it culminated in an advertisement for another game that isn't released until 2016 and an in-game baseball bat.\n\nLast year, we had \"Crimefest,\" where the top reward Overkill was to release was a mystery. This mystery ended up being John Wick. A movie tie-in they were going to make and release anyway.\n\nLast year, some of the rewards for Crimefest were \"FBI Files\" (in-game stats), and a new enemy. These weren't released until this year. The FBI files ended up being a re-implementation of a community web page, and the new enemy ended up just being a bunch of shields standing in a circle.\n\nThis year, Overkill did a \"Hype Train\" event. By pre-ordering DLC, we would get \"hype-fuel\" points. With enough \"hype-fuel,\" rewards for the community would be unlocked. In order to boost sales, Overkill finally delivered on a promise of finishing their new prestige levels (called Infamy). The first five infamy levels provided very small gameplay benefits along with awesome in-game masks. The next 20 levels released in Infamy 2.0 provided new masks and experience point bonuses (so you can infamy....faster?). I call this \"Mask Pack 2.0.\" It took Overkill 14 months to release this. In response, people started refunding their DLC pre-orders. In response to THAT, Overkill released the DLC early so no one could get refunds. The latest Hype-train reward has yet to be released. In response to this, I completely stopped buying DLC. I have no DLC at all that has been released since Mask Pack 2.0.\n\nAnd most recently, Overkill added microtransactions after explicitly saying that they will NEVER do that along with intentionally breaking extremely well made community mods. Overkill does not deserve your money. They do not deserve any money. They have repeatedly broken their promises to the community. They have insulted the community. They have done absolutely nothing but show how far a company can fall.\n\nOverkill, shame on you. I truly do not believe there are words that can describe my level of disappointment with you. Am I angry? You bet your \u2665\u2665\u2665 I am. But more than that, I'm just so disappointed. You've truly shown that you are nothing but liars and cheats.
