The graphics are old but that doesn't take away from it and gives it uniqueness.  If you play with randoms in PvE you wont have the best time, but PvP and you'll still have enjoyment on your own.  \n\nNow that my opinion on the game itself is here, lets adress why I STRONGLY reccomend you NOT to download this game, or at the very least to NOT support the developers. \n\nA few months ago this game underwent a server migration which you can read more about here ---> https://steamcommunity.com/games/273110/announcements/detail/1655510866879925331\nIn this migration, if you didn't notice the notification for it so you could opt into the migration, everything you had would be 'PERMANENTLY DELETED'.  This meaning, if you spent any money wether it be $0.29 or $100 worth of guns, characters, accessories, etc. would be wiped as well.  Had this company even CARED about their player base, they could at least issue the value of in-game items to what you spent over the years of you playing the game to anyone who sent in a support ticket with proof of how much they had spent in game.  I myself sent in a ticket with this issue and provided the information of how much I had spent along with my steam purchase history to prove that it was to CSNZ, I was greeted with a copy/paste response saying how it was MY fault and that they can't do anything about it.  From the poor decision of this company, MANY players lost hundreds even THOUSANDS of hours worth of grinding for, levels, equipment, guns, and characters.  This decision had absolutely ZERO thought and NO respect for the players, put your time into a game where the developers would at least allow you to keep the things you've accumulated over time.", "timestamp_created": 1529050380, "timestamp_updated": 1529050380, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.878164052963256836", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30666973": {"recommendationid": "30666973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171284053", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 21853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499590507}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed this game while I was allowed to play it.\n\nHowever, after spending $90 in the in-game shop, I tried to log in one day, only to find out that I had been permanently banned for 'macro/auto-clicker use'  which is something I have never done.\nI made a ticket with Nexon support, and after 2 days they finally responded to me to tell me:\n \"We have several proof of you using macros / auto-clickers.

No actual information about your system is ever sent or saved.\n\nPlease note that anti-cheat tools are a necessity in multiplayer games to protect you, our community, and please be assured that your privacy is important to us too. \n\nRegards,\n[NX]Dualism\n\n- According to this Nexon Developer Dualism, \" No actual information about your system is ever sent or saved.\" So what is the point of having Xigncode3 on our computers that are \" hashing scanned strings and comparing them to those of known malicious programs\"? All information online is being sent, received, saved, and transcribed. If you have the balls to claim that \"No actual information about your system is ever sent or saved\" then you shouldn't be a developer at all because you have ZERO  knowledge of how data works online.   \n\nIf Xigncod3 does not send or store information, how is it that another Nexon Developer is able to tell a user (on the forums) [**it is or will be deleted by Nexon when you read this review**]  that they were visting a malicious website regarding hacks, cheats, etc (I don't know what the user was on). Information was sent somewhere so that the developer could read the log or history and determine the user was on a malicious website. In order to have a log or history... something was saved. Ex. How do we know what happened in the past if it wasn't written down? That was your first contradiction Dualism. \n\nXigncode does not store information about my system huh? How do you explain that the program keeps track of everything on the users computer and what was modify within the last 48 hours? Is it necessary for Nexon or the company that codes Xigncode to know what print driver I have installed or that I created a meme on Microsoft Paint? I mean that meme is a new/edited file. Do you really want to see it that bad before i post it on Imgur or 9gag?  Second contradiction Dualism. \n\nAlso, just because the information being sent by Xigncode may be (BIG MAY BE)  encrypted doesn't mean a hacker  (reverse engineer) can't decode the encryption and possibly steal user connection info such as ip address, internet company they use and possibly more. Big companies like Walmart, JPMorgan Chase and Target got hacked for their customer credit cards. Here is a full list of companies that were hacked in 2014\nhttp://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/10/cyber-attacks-on-us-companies-in-2014 \n\nHow is one to trust a gaming company so small that it can compare itself to Valve and Blizzard which have superior net worth and income levels to protect users if their data was ever breached?Thats your third contradiction Dualism. Xigncode may perform similar functions as Valve (Vac) and Blizzard (Warden) but it doesn't guarantee user protection.  Also if Counter-strike Nexon Zombies is on Steampowered which is owned by Valve why not adopt the VAC system? Nexon Zombies is basically a big mod of Counter-Strike 1.6 so shouldn't it adopt the same anti-cheat system?\n\nThe fact that Nexon changes their EULA on the whim without letting their users know is questionable. Blizzard, Valve, Ubisoft all send out notices that EULA has been updated/changed and asks the user to accept it. Most don't read it but we at least know it was updated/changed. \n\nDualism, Do you care to update or change your response? \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Updated* (11/18/15) - Nexon is currently using XIGNCODE for their hack sensor. XIGNCODE scans all the files within your computer that was opened in the last 48 hours as well as the websites you've visited within those hours.. This is a huge breach of your rights, and privacy and a potential data .mine for hackers..\n\n\n\nGame use to be good.... Now it just sucks. Most servers are filled with lag and people teleporting thru the map. Every update/patch seems to make the servers worse. Game has been more about money grabbing by Nexon then building a gaming community that appreciates the game thus more likely to actually spend. Majority of the players are EU>SA>NA but SA players are unsupported with a server. They piggyback on NA servers causing all types of lag and server glitches due to their connection. If you're in NA servers expect your ping to bounce from <100 to about 200-300+. Not many hackers which is a +1 but a ton of people abuse bugs and tons who use VPN even tho is banned by Nexon. +1 for staff since they actually read forum posts.", "timestamp_created": 1444414535, "timestamp_updated": 1458781252, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 773, "votes_funny": 48, "weighted_vote_score": "0.910334110260009766", "comment_count": 55, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 0, "developer_response": "Dear Players,\n\nXIGNCODE3 is an well known anti-cheat tool that is currently being used by more than 2000 games.\nIt is very similar in its functionality to the ones used by Valve (VAC) or Blizzard (Warden) to protect their community from cheaters.\n\nClient-side anti-cheat tools are considered to be much safer than server-side ones and they all have to scan information on your PC to protect the game from cheaters.\nThese programs are hashing scanned strings and comparing them to those of known malicious programs.

The chat is annoyingly filled with astrixes, even for stupid phrases that only an over-protective mum or Chinese game would want or need.\n\n-You still can't have a PROPER server, nor go to ANY server that isn't (in the scheme of things) run by Nexon. Seriously, I challenge you to find a PLAYER OR COMMUNITY HOSTED server. This has led to it being as though you were playing with bots, even with a full room.\n\n-You cannot change your name without forking over a few bucks, you know, as if this were some sort of MMO. This also applies to clan tags (or tites, as they've been turned into).\n\n-You will find the same exact 3-5 maps being repeated over, and over, and over.\n\n-There's no way to filter languarges. This is especially problematic if you don't fluently speak Spanish in the American regional servers.\n\n-Different player models have different stats, AGAIN giving an advantage to those wiling to fork money over (or who win the lottery-level luck of the Decoder).\n\n-The twice-afore-mentioned Decoder CONSTANTLY plays the 'so-and-so player you have probobly no damned clue who is has just won <INSERT OVERPOWERED WEAPON / PLAYER MODEL HERE> message, which constantly interrupts the few times when someone manages to /actually/ start up a dialogue.\n\n+PLUSSES+\n\n+It's good to fill in the nostalgia, for a few hours.\n\n+It provides the oppertunity to therapeutically punch zombies.\n\n+It's a good time waster, when everything else you play is patching.\n\n=That... really is all I can think about.

I will be going over the pros and cons of Counter Strike: Nexon Zombies. This may be a long review so bear with me on this.\nI'm going to start with the pros of this game to keep this review on sort of a positive note.\n\n    Pros: One of the pros of this game is that it is absolutely free. This makes it the only game in the Counter Strike series that is actually free. But while it also being free it is the only counter strike game as far as I know with DLC. Another pro I have for this game as it sort of combines the layouts of multiple CS games prior to this. \n\n     With the core gun look coming from Condition Zero, along with the gun looks. There are a lot more looks that are borrowed from previous installments and added to this game. Adding on to the pros this game has a multitude of modes. This game is absolutely full of modes and things to play as. Which for other cs games having it only pushed to a few modes (If you don't include community maps and modes etc.) This leaves room for a lot of time to be put into this game without the ability of getting bored on paper. While this is a good thing on paper it does have some flaws which I will go over during the cons. \n    Finally the last pro would be that it has more guns than in any other cs game. Nexon went all out on this game when it came to guns. It has almost infinitely more guns and to get them all would take a great amount of time. However this is also a major con, but I will keep things positive here. The guns all have different ideas and looks to them and different purposes of said guns. Even have a lazer shooting pistol apparently made by aliens. This is something you will never find in any other CS game. \n\n     Now with all of these positives you might be thinking, \"Hey this game seems excellent, what can really be that bad about it?\". Sadly there are a lot of cons holding this game back from being amazing. I will go over them now.\n\nCons: So time to start for the first con and this is probably one of the biggest. The first con for this game would be gun balancing. I brought up in the Pros that there were a lot of guns. However there is little balancing to any of the guns. With little spray pattern to any of them. A lot of the guns either being absolutely overpowered to the point of being able to shoot through solid walls with only small damage debuffs. With other guns being to the point of being so bad they are basically unusable. The hit registration on this game is also extremely broken and nasty. Me having an uncountable of times when shots should have registered or should have hit.\n     If Nexon would decide to actually stop making more guns and try to balance all the guns to where they arent absolutely op and terrible. It would definitely improve the experience of this game. Now for the next Con this con would be the absolutely terrible system of doing things. If you are wondering what I'm referring to I'm talking about the kicking, matchmaking, and other basic elements in the game. \n    The kicking system looks like a pretty cut and clean system but what hides underneath of it is a terrible and flawed algorithm. it requires an extensive amount of votes to kick anyone and just like csgo if literally 3 people vote no on a team of around 15 the vote will cancel and the kick will fail. Now there is a matchmaking system to where you can queue for a game. However everytime I try to go in it the time it tremendously long and to be honest would just be better if it were removed and just continued the manual searching. \n    This con was personally devastating to multiple people which was the server migration. The migration in general was just messy, and terribly flawed. If you were inactive in the time of the migration all of your items every single one of them would be gone. Nexon should have allowed support tickets for any loss of items but sadly that was not the case. Another con for the game would be that new players would be forced to play against higher levels. This will often lead to a high lack of fun for newer players having their extremely underpowered base guns going against guns that can literally shoot through walls. \n\n   There are more pros and cons to this game however I will end this review on my ending note. My ending note on this game is that it has the ability to be an excellent game. It probably has the most potential of any cs game to become one of the greats. This game just really needs to be polished and edited to where guns are more balanced and everything is fixed.

Do know before you begin reading this review that this is a very HONEST review. Even though some aspects of this game aren't the most ideal and great i do still enjoy this game till today. Please feel free to edit me if any way if i misunderstood some aspects of this game, I am always open to new ideas. Sorry for the essay guys xD!\n\nPositive:\n- Large variety of guns to select from.\n- Alot of different modes and maps to choose and play from.\n- Family and groups to hang out with.\n- Old counter strike maps to play on.\n- Have both PvP And PvE.\n- A nice story line.\n- A nice community who are willing to help out.\n- Most of the computers can run this game smoothly.\n- Alot of very active and helpful mods in this game.\n- Constant updates (There is updates every 2 weeks)\n\nNegative:\n- Requires a lot of grinding.\n- Alot of campers in this game.\n- Very loud and unbalanced sound.\n- Very unbalanced weapons.\n- Really bad graphics.\n- Game layout may be difficult for new players to navigate.\n- Many of the weapons and items you get in the game are durable.\n- There isn't alot of english players in this game.\n- Events are quite repetitive in this game\n- There are bugs in some of the maps and modes.\n\nNow lets get to the hot topic of this game.\n\nIs this game a free to play game?\n\nBefore i answer this question i just want you guys to know that this game is heavily based on luck and the following answer is based on players who are just normal players with normal luck going into the game.\n\nThis game is a free to play game if you don't mind having a bunch of durable weapons and items. Being killed by other players with better weapons. Being killed by zombies in the zombie hero mode or zombie scenario. However you can still enjoy the different modes and maps without paying a single penny! This is what you will experience if you are willing to invest in at around 15 hours into this game.\n\nThis however can be changed but it requires a large amount of grinding and a few hundred hours invested into the game. Now lemme explain the systems in this game and how it works.\n\nThis game like i said before offers a lot of durable weapons and items. However if you do want permeant weapons and don't want to pay a single penny it is still very possible. This method will require you to invest at least a few hundred hours if you are a player who has a average luck like i do. Now the ways you can earn permeant weapons are through events (Do know that many events don't offer permeant weapons), crafting, extension coupons, mileage decoders and by bingo boards. Now lemme go through briefly each of these systems.\n\nEvents:\nEvents in this game sometimes offer decoders and supreme decoders (Most are really few to nothing) and gives out weapons at times depending on the month. Some of the weapons given like the christmas weapons have a duration. Other events like the spell the weapon name event gives permeant weapons however doesn't have much of a difference compared to the default weapons (This is changed due to some new updates like the serpeant blade or the fire axe... The weapons depends on the event so if you manage to play on a good event then there are good weapons out there for you to get) Also i just want to add that Nexon is being more and more generous with the events on counter strike nexon zombies. The most recent event lets players get 10 decoders everyday for playing one and a half hour + the 3 you can get everyday and 3 you can get every week. This event will last for more than a month so you can end up with more than 400+ decoders. Nexon has also been giving out free premium decoders to the users lately which is why Nexon's events are getting better and they are being more generous.\n\nThe crafting system:\nThis system is mostly used when you complete daily missions, grind zombie kills and decomposing your weapons (Most popular one) Now to actually have a chance of even getting a permeant weapon you need to sythensize and combine your durables to 72 days - permeant. Do know that this process can fail and result you with nothing left. Now if you were lucky enough to go through that you also have to do the same with the blueprints. After all that is done you still aren't offered a 100% chance at getting a permeant craft you still have the chance to fail. From my hours and i may just have been a really unlucky guy after a few hundred hours into the game i have only crafted one permeant weapon. This is just one way to earn a permeant weapon. However you can also stack up your duration of the weapon so for example if you have dual infinity for 100 days if you open another decoder with dual infinity 100 days it will stack on top of each other untill it becomes permeant which is 999 days.\n\nExtension coupons:\nNow to earn extension coupons you can either get this from decoders or by disasembling weapons. When you disasemble weapons and if you are doing this right with a large amount of weapons you have the chance of earning a few extension coupons. When you open decoders you have the chance to win around 20 extension coupons ++ and the max you can earn i believe is around 500. With that you need to save up to 999 extension coupons with that you can then make one permeant weapon.\n\nMileage decoders:\nMileage decoders are like buying lottery or opening lottery the chances of earning permeant weapons can be scarce at times and won't get you much. If you are lucky you can get some permeant weapon at your first opening. However if you are unlucky you can open a hundred decoders and not get a single permeant weapon.\n\nBingo board:\nIn the bingo board you can pick up some really good permeant weapons. However to be able to use the bingo board you will need to open decoders which will grant you 30 to around 50 mileage points. Now you are only able to earn 3 mileage decoders a day which requires you to play a total of 3 hours. With these mileage points you can choose to reset your board to get good permeant weapons which requires 50 mileage points and changing the grand prize for 350. Now as you advance in the bingo board your opening special numbers will increase and so will opening random numbers making you need to grind and farm more for permeant weapons. In general if you are a free to play player it will require a large amount of game time and investment.\n\nWeapon upgrade event:\nWhen the weapon upgrade event comes around you can upgrade non permeant weapons into permeant weapons but with a even stronger form then its previous. This event usually brings 4 weapons that can be upgraded into the game. All you have to do is just open a few mileage decoders or craft the weapon which is quite easy if you save up alot of mileage decoders or blue prints and is another way to earn powerful and permeant weapons.\n\nIf you can endure everything i have just mentioned above, install and play away it is indeed a free to play game if done right. I just want to say that i do enjoy this game and i really like it and would recommend it to my friend. However i just wanted to do a honest in depth review of the game. I still love this game though! It is still part of my favorites! Anyway thanks for reading! I also just wanted to add that this game is getting much better and Nexon is being way more generous in the events they have recently.", "timestamp_created": 1462232725, "timestamp_updated": 1469896709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 71, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.799897074699401855", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43880797": {"recommendationid": "43880797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163377973", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546206206}, "language": "english", "review": "I use to enjoy this game but now this game pisses me off so much. i'll never play it again after my account was restarted.

And yet Decoders are expensive as f#@k, each decoder cost roughly 8$, yeah buddy that's right 8 f#@king Dollars... Everything in this game is overpriced. You have to make microtransactions for almost every stuff you want in the game.\n- You can't change your old shameful nickname that you first chose to register to the game without buying the \"Nickname-change\" from the in-game shop.\n- If you're F2P, it requires a lot of grinding, most of the times up to 6 months/1 year of grinding for a good weapon.\n- They removed so much features that was the only way for FREE TO PLAY users to get free stuff, like Crafting, free decoders per playing for an X amount of time...\n- Every update (which takes at least ~4hrs) is totally broken, and they need to do an Urgent maintenance, or extand it for up to 10hrs...\n- Updates are always bad af, so much worse than CSO.\n- They ruin something which was working just fine, and pretend to fix something that weren't broken in first place...\n- Bugs! Bugs and glitches are everywhere...\n- The user interface is locked to 1024x768, regardless of your specified in-game resolution. \n- They changed the old user interface by a new one that only work in other CSO regions, which they have at least ~5k players peak a day, (I'm talking here about  Matchmaking) compared to CSO, CSN:Z at best get 1500 players peak a day, which make the matchmaking useless (No one is using it anyway), most of players are using  Custom rooms.\n- Game layout is difficult for new players to navigate.\n- They merged the servers (EU, NA, SA, RU and TR) all together, so don't get shocked when you see players with 350+ ping (South Americans) teleporting all around the  map infecting people from ~5m...\n- This is the game with the most broken acheivements in Steam, they ruinned so much achievements or removed them for good, no chance now for Steam acheivements hunters  to get 100%...\n- Let's not talk about how much hard some achievements/medals to get, it's nearly impossible to get...\n- This is a 20yo engine we're talking about here (GoldSrc) and yet most decent PCs now a days can't run CSN:Z smoothly.\n- Very bad and outdated graphics compared to the required resources to play. (Note that the System Requirements shown in Store page are outdated)\n- Too heavy compared to CS 1.6, it takes so much RAM (up to 3Gb), and the CPU is always at 30% minimum, even in lobby.\n- FPS drops, server lags, freezings... You can't play without getting them, you are playing suddenly your fps drops to -15fps and comes back again to normal, or  getting 100+ping because of their sh#tty servers, the constant freez while playing especially in each round start.\n- Lets talk about the community, it's the most cancerous and toxic community in a game ever, no respect, no fairplay... they will insult you for no valid reason,  literally, just because you infect or kill someone, then they start cursing you (the worst is with a broken English) especially the Turks, they are the most Toxic  people on earth... They block you to not escallad ladders to get to a safe place to hide from zombies, just to kill you instantely when you get infected...

The patch changed it to where you can no longer (at least I have not found a way) go to whichever region you want, either europe, NA or russia for instance, this is an inconvenience to me because when I am available to play NA is dead, so I used to go on the Europe servers. On top of that there is seemingly no games open for zombie hero or anything of the sort (I'm not sure if i'm in a NA lobby or if they are all grouped together), probably because nobody else is happy about this update or it could just be bad timing. The matching system is slow and often can't find a match. The old UI worked just fine we didn't need you guys to go screwing with crap. Also we can no longer make Zombie games (not zombie hero, but zombie) in friendly fire. Also when I started playing again (after about a year break) they had a lot of new guns which interested me, however it was absolutely PAY to play. Used to you had a chance at getting good weapons by using crafting recipes (not sure when they removed that) which was good because it gave the game something more to it, you could try to get blueprints and durables to get good weapons and not have to pay; however, now it is completely pay to play.\n\nIn my opinion CSNZ is tanking (and has been recently), don't spend all your money guys they're just trying to milk this out for as long as possible instead of trying to figure out what the PLAYERS want.\n So until they fix this new piece of crap UI, I'm out.

I have played Counter Strike Online Taiwan for 9 years and when I moved to NA server a month ago I felt the transition was perfectly fine. The community in Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is great. A lot better than Counter Strike Online Taiwan. Players are nice to each other. This game was basically my childhood. Now let's get into the details of the game.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\nThe game is like a game within a game. There are lots of lot modes you can play. Zombie, Zombie Scenario, Human Scenario, Classic, and much more.\nGood Community.\nThey bring CS 1.6 back to life with different modes while still having the original available to CSN:Z players.\nThey come with updates weekly which keeps the game fun and  alive.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\nPeople with money have an advantage over players who don't spend money.\nI have heard that people have been banned for no legit reason without proof that they cheat.\nThe game only have a family list but there is no friends list\nCounter Strike Nexon: Zombies is slower when it comes to keeping up with new updates. It takes from 6 months to a year to be updated with Korea's and Taiwan's current CSO updates.\nZombie Hero is basically a Pay to WIn game. Whoever has the top guns in Zombie Hero (Magnum Drill, Warhammer, Dark Knight) usually gets the most kills and the highest score. (just look at my profile:P)\n\nOverall this game is fun. It was part of my childhood. It has different modes and it brings CS1.6 to life.

They don't return to their spawnpoint either when threatened by a T.\n\nIn terms of weaponry the game doesn't have the Tactical Shield, which is known to be in both CZ and 1.6, probably removed so they can sell it or something. The weapon favourites from CSS make an appearance in CSNZ as well, except they're 5 shared for both teams, rather than 4 for each team (which totalled in 8). The buy menu Packages from are completely absent. There are new weapons added such as different melee weapons and pistols, but these were NOT balanced correctly.\n\nThe AK-12, for instance, is literally an AK-47 with a huge magazine and the same recoil pattern, except 3 times smaller. And the price in the buy menu? Stays the same. It also felt like the damage output was greater, but I can't confirm that. Other weapons, such as the Hammer, are outright useless. Shooting the P90 in CSNZ feels like shooting a bloody pea shooter. It's weak, inaccurate, and the most expensive SMG.\n\nThen comes in the character models. The females are always 10 times more expensive than males, and it makes sense why that is the case. Not only are the hitboxes smaller, but the skins all look the same in-game, so you can't confirm what is an enemy and what is a friendly unless you look at the radar, which takes much more time than just looking and shooting. This makes the game impossible to play.\n\nBot matches are included, and while you can play on them, the bots are braindead and easy to kill in droves. Not only that but the friendlies NEVER SHUT UP. It's the most annoying thing ever. Oh and the game allows people to keep spamming you invitations to their server rooms which is just annoying as all hell.\n\nThe tutorials don't teach you nearly enough for you to be able to play the game. It's just movement and basic stuff, no practice other than the Bot matches you can do outside of the tutorial.\n\nZombie mode is the worst part of the game. Don't even bother.\n\nSo why do I recommend this game, even after defecating on it thoroughly? Because, overall, as a free alternative to proper Counter-Strike games, it serves it's purpose. If you have CS:CZ, it's a downgrade. If you have CS 1.6, you're not missing out on much. Just stick to the main series games and forget this game even exists.\n\nEDIT: The game maxes out your mouse sensitivity whenever you open it, and doesn't revert it back to where it was.

Basically, a Westernized version of CSO. \n-Both run on GoldSrc but the latter is updated over time with new game modes, maps, characters, weapons and skins.\n-Yes, it's localized in several languages including Turk, Russian, Spanish, etc.\n\nNow to answer OP's question. * If you were to take a look at the reviews first, you'll see the amount of hate posted by people. The main keyword behind this is \"Nexon\" which has gained notoriety for cramming P2W elements in their games. However! I advise you not to simply judge it just by the pictures and the reviews (obviously). Now off to the differences:\n\n[h1] [b] CS1.6\t[/b] \n-Valve\n-Play with community-made contents (skins, maps)\n-Your custom skins don't work on sv_pure 1 servers\n-Still lots of people playing it over CSN:Z\n-Valve Anti Cheat (system ban)\nUnless you play on custom servers, you just stick with the default no-nonsense weaponry and characters\n\n[b] CSN:Z\t[/b]\n-Nexon SARL (permission from Valve)\n-Play with Nexon-made contents (occassionally player-made)\n-Your purchased/ crafted items work on servers as long as you don't get banned\n-Lesser player count than CS1.6 but it's because of it not receiving good response thanks to its name\n-Nexon HackShield + Game Security (no system bans, but Nexon bans based on community-submitted reports)\n-Although room hosts can opt for CS1.6 contents, gameplays mostly revolved around custom weapons, skins and maps\n\t[/h1]\n\nNow both are double-edge swords. While people still love the originality of CS1.6, CSNZ provides a different style of gameplay in addition to CS1.6 contents. It offers new maps, gameplay, skins and weapons that players could explore and enjoy.\nCSN:Z no doubt has its own cash shop that allows players to make (optional) purchases but Nexon has altered the formula to be more generous for Western players. For instance, giving players 10 free decoders (think of CSGO's weapon cases + keys) daily for more than a month.

I can't tell if this game is trying to be a Call of Duty rip-off or not. Dead serious. In CSNZ, you can partake in multiple gamemodes that you feel you want to play. There's Original, which is basic CS 1.6. There's different kinds of Zombie modes, but I only played one. I had a huge problem with this Zombie mode. It is WAY too unbalanced. A CT has 100 HP, and can be turned into a Zombie in 1 hit. A Zombie has 2000 HP (with the exception of the 7000 HP host zombie) and can take a LONG time to kill. This game is a grindfest. I only won 2 rounds as Humans due to hiding. The last mode I want to talk about is Survival. This game should have never been called Zombies. It should've been about this Survival mode, because it is the best thing in this game and the only reason i'd go back to play (besides playing with new guns in Original mode). In Survival mode, it's purely you and your teammates and whatever cash you can scavenge. Waves of different kinds of HUMAN enemies will try to kill you. Regular gunmen, big ass armored soldiers with miniguns, Survival has it all, including a Boss battle at the end of each one. As you kill more and more soldiers you can buy bigger and better guns and equipment. Survival missions technically have a story line, but you will be more inveloped in the gameplay than someone who only gives lines during the middles of waves. It can become really chaotic and what balances this factor out is a super quick regeneration system. It's just like CoD. Hide back and wait, but it only takes a couple of seconds. Normally, this kind of thing doesn't go good in my book. I've always thought regenerating health as a character was kind of a cheat. The way I prefer it is how it works as a pickup in Quake. But it works with Survival mode. It fits right in and makes the mode so much more fun.\n\nNow that i'm done with the gamemodes. Let's move on to the rest of the game. There is a shop to buy things with your points you've collceted for either playing for an extended amount of time or for completing a mission or match. Now this isn't a problem. You may want to buy new guns with these points. Oh wait. YOU CAN't. THERE ARE NO SINGLE GUNS LISTED IN THE SHOP. ONLY THING AVAILABLE IS WEAPON PACKAGES THAT COST REAL USD. I can't overexagerate how stupid companies are when they place a pay 2 win system in their games. And these guns can be seriously overpowered in some matches. It really shows that games like these don't care about your experience, but your money.\n\nLet me explain my overall gameplay feeling. I can't enjoy Zombie mode, so i'm gonna skip that. Original mode is actually not all that bad. At first I was confused, but it was a quick adjustment. I think Original mode allows for players to pick up new guns they bought and try to test them against other players, to see if it was really worth the purchase. You can play on all the old CS 1.6 maps, including dust2 and italy, And with the game's updated player graphics, it actually feels really nice. Survival mode is amazingly fun and the only reason you should actually sit down and play this game.\n\nI don't recommend this game. Only because of it's poor Zombies mode, which is how the game was advertised, and because of the Pay2Win system. If this game got rid of some things, it'd be a fun addition to the CS series, but I can't find all my fun in it. Yes, Survival is great and all, but that doesn't mean i'm gonna sit there 24/7 gunning down massive waves of enemies. Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies tries it's best to fit in with the rest of the franchise, but some factors just kick it to the curb.\n\n*UPDATE* (As of 10/26/14)\nI've read peoples messages, comments, etc. And all I keep finding is the complaint of needing to play for more than an hour before writing a review. First off, I played a good 50 minutes. Sorry if I was 10 away from the 1 hour mark. Second, I don't remember the point where playtime resulted in a fun game. If there are so many reviews on this game, with low playtime, wouldn't that hint you that it wasn't an overall enjoyable experience, causing us to put down the game?\n\nI'm still sticking with all my points. I really don't see any reason to change what I feel about them. The game dissapointed me, so I only sat through 50 minutes of it.
