This is game I bought originally with bit of feeling will it help me with my future career of becoming a truck driver however this was recommended for me by fellow student who has used it to practice reversing and other important things. \n\nHow does this game work out for me?\nIts really helpful and gives right idea how driving a truck ain't all easy as it seems first. I used my Logitech G29 with this game and semi automatic gearbox mode to always change gears. Mod support too for the game is very good and specially fact how you can get more realistic parts to the game that aren't in the base game/added by DLC content.\n\nWould I recommend this?\nYes I do 100% if you got steering wheel and pedals + are becoming a truck driver. Mods give huge things add to this even when got all DLC content (I recommend buy everything as pack or piece by piece in bundles when discount so that get to save also money :)\n\nIs the game difficulty?\nTo me not that much. its more about learning to remember you got to take corners more carefully and always consider that you don't hit any civilians either. Though there are always blind corners and areas in the mirrors, you have to check certain way to more know if one is there. I learned my own method for this within few hours of playing this game.\n\nnegatives?\n\nFor sure one I want to truly point out is that seems whenever you are running out of your driving time, that can be done between breaks, there is always cops showing up or hiding somewhere among the cars behind you in the dark. Its like they spawn always at the most annoying moment. Sometimes you just can't make the stop because the next truck stop might be few kilometers away still. \n\nAI drivers in roundabouts specially seem to love try hit you if you are side by side. It kinda is part of the programming I guess they don't understand how much space you need. I've experienced moments when I've been bit and then see from mirror AI car stopping but avoided penalty because seemed for once system realized its not my fault if someone hits me on purpose. \n\nAnother thing about AI cars, watch out for \"break checkers\" that seem to be a thing. Sometimes they break by random and can't do proper overtaking so I always recommend plan much ahead. \n\nHungary is area where mods don't seem to work out. the moment I arrived at the border, game crashed few times in the row, but once I dropped all off, it was fine. I not sure yet what caused this but its been only country where I've experienced this. \n\n\nfinal scoring:\nBased on what I've seen and count in, I would rate this game 7,5 or 8 out of 10. There are flaws but I more see this game is very good to practice for future truck drivers.

After dragging yourself to your destination for 20 to 30 real-time minutes, you drop off the cargo \u2013 and do the whole thing again.\n\nSuffice to say, then, that this isn\u2019t for everyone; there\u2019s a good chance a few of you have fell asleep merely reading the last paragraph. If you do actually get to the point where you boot up the game for the first time, it even does a lot to try and immediately frighten you off... You\u2019re instantly met with a plethora of menus that are incredibly overwhelming, allowing you to do everything from create a profile to adjusting your X-axis sensitivity for... Well, something. The tutorial then doesn\u2019t help matters, basically stemming down to telling you \u201cJust drive the truck\u201d, and then buggering off and leaving you to work out how exactly you do that in the first place. \n\nYet give it a chance to get things rolling and \u2013 amazingly and most crucially \u2013 it really works. There\u2019s a bunch of reasons why this is the case, that go way beyond the primal satisfaction that comes with driving a hulking great big rig. For one, there\u2019s an incredibly calming sense of slow progression constantly burning away in the background, with the sat-nav in the corner of your screen always slowly ticking down the miles left towards your destination. It\u2019s surprisingly satisfying to watch the numbers keep dropping, and finally whittling a distance that seemed impossible to begin with down to nothing. \n\nSecondly, there's the option to turn on your own music while driving, or even tune in to actual radio stations across Europe. Set one of these up and hit the perfect moment, where the right song comes on as you watch the sun slowly rise and peep through the trees, and it all just feels\u2026 Right. Heck, take my word for it when I say that having AC/DC\u2019s \u201cHighway to Hell\u201d blasting out your speakers as you\u2019re racing down the road at max speed is something that\u2019s hard to beat. If you\u2019re daring, you can even pop a video or TV show up in another window and zone out... But just like real life, the chances of you suddenly finding yourself wrapped round the nearest streetlight rapidly increase if you do this. Still, it\u2019s fun to try. In the game, that is. \n\nThere\u2019s also a healthy degree of strategy mixed in as well. Your truck needs fuel and your driver needs rest, and managing the two becomes a delicate balancing act of effective time management, where you are constantly checking out your route and seeing how far you can push yourself before you literally fall asleep at the wheel. While it takes way too long if you\u2019re not wishing to put yourself in a position of extreme bank debt (so much so it actually gets a little frustrating), you can even make enough money to hire other truckers to your cause. Suddenly you\u2019re busy plotting out an empire, trucks roaming across all of Europe, and your hard work being rewarded with a skyrocketing bank account. You can even make the core game more complicated, if you\u2019re that way inclined. An automatic gearbox might be the obvious choice, but there\u2019s nothing stopping you from having to switch through all the gears manually, or even hooking a wheel up and going totally crazy. The choice, as they say, is yours.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth pointing out all the mods that are available to enhance or change things up \u2013 from the big changes to the little tweaks, there\u2019s a lot you can bolt on to the base experience. Whether it be branding the sides of trucks with famous logos, or subtly changing the map and the way your truck handles, there\u2019s a lot you can tinker about with if things are starting to feel a little dry. Special shout out to the mod that lets you personalise the inside of your truck \u2013 because there\u2019s something irresistible about decking out your cabin with a giant BB-8 and a bunch of other nerdy bits and bobs that fill up every empty space. While not offered in the game or mods themselves (and I can't say I tried this myself), there\u2019s also means out there to take things online, hitting the road with truckers all over the world. Chances are you\u2019ll end up in a traffic jam trying to get a ferry to somewhere, but hey, whatever floats your boat. \n\nIn the end, whatever you choose to do and however seriously you take what\u2019s on offer, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is perhaps the definite chilled out experience; with everything always just coming back down to you and the open road. It\u2019s the perfect game to unwind after a stressful day, where the challenge or intensity of most other games simply doesn't appeal, and that's what makes it something so much more than something to laugh at.", "timestamp_created": 1493330743, "timestamp_updated": 1493395474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 542, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.969325244426727295", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28381602": {"recommendationid": "28381602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076348453", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 179354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1595, "last_played": 1551848052}, "language": "english", "review": "As a retired truck driver of 40 years I never though I would end up playing a game about truck driving but I find it a pleasing experiance when I can travel the European roads which I traveled daily.

It's surprisingly therapeutic driving from city to city, obeying the road rules rather than smashing things up like a madman.  That said, if you disable the speed-limiter in options (90kph) you can get a bit crazy, getting as high as 150kph+ on some routes, a bit of a thrill considering the cargo you have in tow!  Speed cameras will become your enemy though.\n\nUnfortunately the AI of the other traffic can at times frustrate.  In some instances such as in underpasses under freeways you can find intersections where the cars always fail to give way, probably because the intersection was not programmed correctly.  Don't get me started on the kamikaze AI at roundabouts either.\n\nIn any case, this is the most fun you can have driving a truck in a game.

This game is from the people of SCS who made other Truck Simulator games, as referring to [i]18 Wheels Of Steel Series and Euro Truck Simulator[/i]\n\n[h1]Seems boring to play if you do the same thing over and over[/h1]\n\nIt sure seems like it does, I honestly thought when I first saw this game it seemed boring when I saw this. I gave the first Euro Truck Simulator a try and loved it. This game soul purpose is meant for people who want to kill the time that's worth it and love driving. \n\n[h1]Is it really all about driving?[/h1]\n\nActually, yes it is. It may seem like an easy task to do, but it's actually a challenge.\nYou start off small as you drive for other companies and build your way up. You start with the very small tasks that you can get done within the first 20 minutes of your gameplay with the short trips. Eventually, you gain skills and level up as you go. You can use those skills to help you for traveling the longer distance and get higher payment as you complete the tasks. Eventually, when you get that steady income, you can own your own truck and make even MORE money. You start off with a small garage, and you'll be able to upgrade it and hire drivers as you go! Even yet, take the shortcut way taking out a loan! You pick on what to do!\n\n[h1]Is it Realistic?[/h1]\n\nYes, and no.\n\nIt's really how you look at it. The Physics on this game isn't 'Top Notch' but it get's the job done. For example, you hit a vehicle you'll just hit each other and no physical damage would be done between the collision. If anything, you'll just get a fine. Speaking of fines, there are laws you have to follow. Such as speeding, Red Lights and Green Lights and so on. The weather system is alright to my standards as you can change the settings of how often you want it to make it rain as you're on the road. Gas and time is a big factor too. It's important to keep track when you need to complete your delivery and keep your Fuel up at times! Sleep is also needed! \n\n[i]Note: Some of these features can be disabled in the future in-game, but will get rid of that 'Simulation' Feel.[/i]\n\n[h1]Is there Multiplayer?[/h1]\n\nThe game alone is more focused on the single player aspects. Although there is a mod where you can download and be able to drive with your friends and other people!\n\n[h1]Is there Mod Support?[/h1]\n\nHeck Yes!\nYou can find a lot of mods, such as custom trucks, map mods, Graphic Mods and more!\nAlthough alot of these mods aren't off the steam Workshop, you would have to try to find these mods somewhere off a ETS2 Mod Page\n\n[h1]Is there Steering Wheel and VR Support?[/h1]\n\nOh yes, definitely. I have the G290 Steering Wheel/Pedal/H Shifter included, it's so much better and very more immersive.\n\nI also have the Oculus Rift, combining it with the Wheel is awesome, I would very recommend pairing it up if you have VR or want to invest into it if your PC meets the requirements.\n\n[h1] Is The DLC even worth it?[/h1]\n\nYes and no\n\nThere's a lot of DLC's shown off this game off the page, but half of them to me aren't worth getting. Most of them are for Paintjobs for your trucks. [i]Even though the Steam Workshop Supplies Free Paintjobs Without even Paying.[/i]\n\nThe important DLC's are the Map Expansions. These are the Map Expansions you would likely want in the future\n\n- Euro Truck Simulator Going East\n- Euro Truck Simulator Scandanavia\n- Euro Truck Simulator Vive La France\n- Euro Truck Simulator Italia\n- Beyond The Baltic Sea\n\nAll of these Expansions alone will give you hours of fun for every single DLC. I have over 500 hours on this game, and only explored 67.32% of the map! [i]That's because I took my time, and didn't rush[/i]\n\n[h1]The Issues I had in the past[/h1]\n\nThere hasn't been that many issues in the past for me, I had rare crashes that happen here and there and stuttering problems, but that's likely my CPU bottlenecking my performance. The AI traffic can be brutal at times, making sudden stops ahead of you, or cutting you off simply. But this is a rare occurrence. Although take care as you put Mods into your game, some mods will crash your game at times, but that's often rare in that case.\n\n[b]Update as of 2019:[/b]\n\nI upgraded my FX 8320 8-Core to a Ryzen 7 1700X, performance has been flawless ever since.\n\n[h1]My Final Verdict[/h1]\n\nif you love driving, this is a must-have! I never had interest in trucks until I played this! The scenery all around you while driving is just..breathtaking. Enough where you just want to stop and admire the scenery around you! There's a wonderful Day/Night Transition, weather effects, going 90kmh in the UK is just great!\n\nProMods is very recommended also if you have all the map expansions!\n\nFor a Simulator, I'm giving this a 9/10.

I never played a game like this before and now it has me hooked. It keeps getting better!\n\nAt first I was just enjoying the scenery, the gameplay of driving the trucks, taking different jobs, and leveling up my XP so I could make more money and buy my own truck (Volvo FH16 Globetrotter). Now I'm working to upgrade my truck and my business. The business part is pretty addictive too. You can take a loan, expand your first garage, start buying more trucks, and hire drivers to work for you. I'm anxious to get enough money to buy another garage somewhere else and start another fleet.\n\nYou can not only use your skill points from XP to strategically improve your abilities and rewards one step at a time to make more money, you can do the same with your drivers (or choose to have their skills auto-balanced).\n\nThe scenery is gorgeous and there are some nice little touches of different things to see on the road and in different cities.\n\nThe changing weather and day/night transformations are great. Rain storms are awesome.\n\nDriving in Europe is really not that different than driving in North America. Although, for some reason driving in the UK made me a little nervous--maybe it's the little extra traffic; maybe it's just driving on the other side of the road; or maybe I was expecting The Stig to cross my path.\n\nI play with a  Driving Force GT wheel, and even though as a fan of racing games I at first had doubts about this game, I gotta say if you have a wheel you really should try this game. Everything about the game is pure pleasure, but the driving is not just enjoyable but challenging as well. Things like parking your trailer; traveling swiftly but balancing your trailer's loads around all kinds of bends, inclines and declines; driving at night; dealing with other drivers (watch out for the evil empire of busses!) and trying to overtake slow pokes who follow the speed limit; traveling as fast as you can and watching for speeding cameras and changing speed limits make this one of the best driving games I've ever played. Oh yeah, don't blow those red lights--all the tickets you could get for various things can really ad up on one trip.\n\nIt actually is becoming a racing game as I'm travelling longer distances. Right now in order to not interrupt my delivery with rest stops and not be late (which costs money) or get fined for driving while tired (happened to me four times at the end of one trip), I'm trying to make my trips even faster. So I'm balancing my loads at top speeds, taking the ever changing curves of the road as gracefully as possible, putting the pedal to the metal but watching for speed cameras and changing speed limits (watch out for those road hazard areas and be careful in town), and trying to overtake just like in a racing game--but it's more challenging with opposing traffic on busy highways!\n\nIt's also a great music game. Hit the road and use your in-game radio to tune into different internet stations or play your favorite music on a media player in the background (I recommend AIMP3, which has a great interface and features but is very low resource).\n\nI highly recommend ETS2!

[b]Yes, the game has 2 steam awards, and yes, they are well-deserverd by the game for being the amazing simulator that it is.[/b] Euro Truck Simulator 2 is not only a great experience that everyone can enjoy, but also a masterpiece in its own right. With such a large and active fanbase, the game grew with the help of its community: mods, multiplayer, new skins, trucks, etc., besides the huge amount of content it has been given from the developers. Official content is still being added to the game to the current day, be it in the form of patches, expansions or bug fixes. This makes my first point: buying ETS2 is a smart investment, since the developers truly care about the game and continue to update it and listen to their fanbase. I can make a quick prediction and say that ETS2 will still have updates or expansions coming out for at least a year or two more after the writing of this review. \n\n[h1][b]What exactly is Euro Truck Simulator 2? (Gameplay)[/b][/h1]\n\nETS2 is a truck driving simulator, but not only that. It places you into the position of the manager of an entire international delivery company. The goal of the game, even though most players will just say it's to relax or to have fun (which is also true), is actually to expand your company, hire more drivers, buy more trucks, more garages and obtain the monopoly for deliveries in Europe. The game takes this simple concept and manages to add an astonishing complexity to it (at first sight only, because after the first 20 hours or less in-game, you'll realize that the gameplay is actually simple and enjoyable). As the manager, you can also make deliveries yourself, which is how you will get your company up and running before you have the money to hire drivers to do that for you. You will start by doing quick jobs for various employers, with a truck given by them for the specific delivery, and your first objective is to buy your own truck so you can start taking jobs from the freight market, which get you more income. Once you get your own truck, it's all yours: you need to take good care of it, repairing it, refuelling it, being careful not to get fined for your actions on the road, and so on. From that point onward it is your job to build a strong and succesful business. As you do more deliveries and manage to get more experience (both literally, for leveling up, and figuratively, because you will learn the mechanics of the game better and better), you will earn skill points with each level up. There are a variety of skills to choose from, including getting better pay for different types of jobs (fragile cargo, urgent deliveries, ADR deliveries, valuable cargo), less consumption of fuel, or being able to deliver cargo across longer distances. Your employees also have skills, a feature that on its own opens lots of possibilities for company management. \nIf the information here or on the store page doesn't quite answer all of your questions, I'll tell you that there is also a demo for this game available to download on Steam so you can try the game out. \n\n[h1][b]But is it accurate? (Driving mechanics)[/b][/h1]\n\nBefore I start explaining the mechanics of the game, please take note that I'm not a truck driver and have never driven a truck before, so excuse me if I don't have all of my facts straight. From my 90 hours of playing the game at the time of writing this review, I'd say that the driving in this game is absolutely beautiful. First of all, the complexity of the mechanics is fully customizable, so everyone from the newest player to the veteran trucker are able to enjoy the game. The driving is relaxing, be it day or night, rain or sun, highway or forest road, because it doesn't require that much focusing, but only as much as to not pass the speed limit, to avoid other people in traffic and to not come tumbling off the road. That gives you time to enjoy the wonderful scenes you'll pass by, which I'll be talking about in the next section. On-board the truck you have every switch you need, meaning headlights, wipers, the horns (air, regular, light), the handbrake, the toggle for high beams, for the beacon and the turning signals. It has everything you would want and need from a proper simulator of real life driving, so don't expect a truck racing game. The only thing that is a tiny bit more difficult is the parking, but there's also a solution for that. The parking is skippable in every delivery, while denying you a small amount of experience. But as you gather more knowledge and start learning what's what, parking should immediately become a breeze after a few hours of gameplay.\nAlso, going a little off-topic, you also have a radio. You can upload your own playlist of music into the game and listen to it while on the road. Genius. [b]Genius[/b], I say. \n\n[h1][b]That's all well and good, but how does it look? (Graphics)[/b][/h1]\n\nDo not go into the game expecting it to look like it was made with Unreal Engine 32. The game came out a good amount of time ago (I'd even go as far as to call it a classic now, heh), and I can say it still looks decent to this day. The in-game world still is wonderful if you're willing to sit for a bit and think about how old the game is. Even if it doesn't have the latest graphics, ETS2 doesn't fail to impress, making up for raw graphical power in great world design. The landscapes in the game are beautiful, and the vehicle models still manage to look good and blend into the environment perfectly, giving the game a really special ambiance and relaxing potential. It is easy to get immersed into the massive world and if you're not careful you can lose hours driving your virtual truck around (as it happens to me quite often).\nBut if I were honest, the question here is how good you [b]can[/b] make it look. As I have said before, the game has such an active community, and modders are no exception. There are a variety of graphic mods to choose from both in the Steam Workshop and outside of it that do a wonderful job at enhancing your visual experience, making the game not only graphically impressing, but also making you want to get into the photo mode and snap some shots of your journey through ETS2's Europe. \n\n[h1][b]So...did you enjoy it? (My personal experience)[/b][/h1]\n\nThe short answer would be yes, absolutely. But the answer worthy of this review is that I just spent so many hours into this game, in which everything you basically do, if we were to dumb it down to an extreme level, is drive around and turn left or right at some points, and I can't even explain why exactly. ETS2 just has a mesmerizing atmosphere to it, making the game beautiful in its own way, and being one of the most relaxing games I have and will ever play. Other simulators can't even get near its level (except American Truck Simulator, made by the same developers and based on the same concept), because for me, ETS2 will always have that [i]je ne sais quois[/i], that *something* which always makes me come back to it and do yet another delivery, over and over again. In other words, everything about the game is enjoyable, from the relaxing driving to the sweet feeling of getting another truck or further customzing your current one, to the trance induced by the exquisite feeling of being alone with the road, and for that, Euro Truck Simulator 2 wil always and forever have a special place in my heart.\n\n[h1][b]Conclusion[/b][/h1]\n\nIf you are looking for a relaxing driving experience with various customization options, a variety of trucks, perfect world design, mesmerizing atmosphere and most of all, a detailed company management gameplay component, then I am sure you will not regret buying this game.

I was expecting something more like, \"the wheels of the truck go round and round\" type of game. And ETS2 is NOT that kind of game.\n\nThis game has a large fan base. And many DLCs. SCS tries to stay on top of errors and bugs to get them resolve. I personaly found one in the game and once I brought it to their attention, it was fixed. This alone speaks volumes to me.\n\nIt is a Single player game. The basics is, you run a trucking company in Europe, and you make money by delivering loads to their locations. And can increase the size of your company by buying more truck shops and getting employees to drive for you. As you level up, you will be able to increase your abilities for what kind of loads and how far to go with them. You can also customize the truck and trailers. Yeah I said trailers, you will be able to buy your own trailers to use. And if you get them for other shops, the AIs willl also choose to use them or not.\n\nHow ever one tip I wish to point out that I noticed, when you are lost in upgrading your own truck, do not forget to also upgrade your trucks that the AIs use, when they are upgraded, they tend to work better bringing in more money.\n\nSo if you love Semi-Trucks, and the ability to run your own buisness for what ever the reason is, this maybe the ideal game for you.

Just me, my machine and a sprawling network of European highways rendered in careful, beautiful detail.

To those of you who already play simulators, some of what I say might seem obvious. I apologise for that in advance. Also, feel free to skip some of the later sections. I really get into the nitty-gritty and made sure to put a lot of detail in this review to help readers decide.\n\nSo, Euro Truck Simulator 2: it's exactly what it says on the tin. This game is driving, driving, driving, and...more driving. There are also some other minor nuances within the game, which I'll address later. \"So, driving? That's pretty much all the game offers?\" you might ask. Yes, for the most part. This might sound boring, especially to people who like games that are fast-paced or offer a lot of action. This is completely understandable, and this was my initial thought on the game as well. I decided to pick it up on a whim during Steam's summer sale of 2017.\n\nSomething about this game drew me in, though. Suddenly a few minutes turned into a few hours. I fell in love rather quickly. I was astonished, I had no idea how I could like a game that was just driving. After some time, I think I understand why I like it so much. This game is surprisingly therapeutic. After a long or stressful day, this is the perfect game to turn to for a couple of peaceful hours. Nothing but you and the road. Hell, if you've been having a bad time in [i]other[/i] games this also a good one to cool off in as well.\n\nNow that I've spoken about my personal experiences with it, let's talk about the game on an objective level. As I previously mentioned, this game is mostly driving. You drive European semi-trailer trucks and are tasked with delivering a variety of cargo from Point A to Point B. There are a number of European countries to drive through, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and many more. You start off with no truck, and instead must work as a driver for hire. You can get loans from the bank fairly early on if you like, or you can save up money until you have enough to buy the truck on your own. This is a game that lets you play at your own pace. \n\nOnce you have purchased a truck of your own, you can start hauling trailers with the custom-built truck of your choosing.\nThis brings me to the customisation; which is superb. There are 7 truck manufacturers and 13 models in total, and all of these can be tuned extensively to fit your personal tastes. These are all officially licensed as well, which means they're replicas of real-life trucks made by real-life manufacturers.  DAF, IVECO, MAN, Mercedes-Benz, Renault, Scania, and Volvo are all featured.\n\nOnto the trucks themselves, and how they work. Appropriately, the trucks themselves are as sophisticated as you would expect. They have all the real-life functionalities in the game. You manually control the windshield wipers, both the left and right turn indicators, lights, as well as a retarder (if your truck's engine is equipped with it) and differential locking. You also have the ability to choose the transmission you would like to play with, and can change it at any time. It covers just about every transmission, from simple automatic to fully manual. This is exactly what a simulator should do of course, but it's worth noting that the game gets it right.\n\nBeyond this, the game has a few interesting nuances. Most notably, there's some underlying RPG elements. You get to name your driver and your company. There are levels, and XP is rewarded upon completion of a job. Each time you level up, you will get a point to place into different skill trees that unlock new cargo to deliver. Hazardous, explosive, and corrosive materials. Fragile cargo such as glass and computer electronics. These are just a few. There are also long-distance deliveries and short time frame deliveries.\n\nInterestingly, there's also a bite-sized business management element. You have the option of buying multiple garages to house more trucks, which you can then hire other drivers to use. The drivers will bring you a profit, and you'll slowly earn more and more as you build your trucking empire. This is, also for the most part, very hard to fail at. 99% of the time your drivers will turn a profit for you. It's also entirely optional, if you wish to abstain from doing this.\n\nI should also talk about the DLC briefly. There are a lot of truck-tuning related DLCs, which are mostly up to you if you want to buy or not. They're all cosmetic, and in my opinion fairly priced. However, they're probably better off buying during a sale. Then there are the DLCs that have a real impact in the game. There are 2 DLCs which add new countries to the game, and 1 that expands on the huge country of France. I highly recommend these, as they add a lot of hours of gameplay and new places to see, as well as new types of jobs. They are a little bit more pricey, but they add a lot of content in the game. My advice would be to play the game for a while, and if you decide you like it then buy the DLC. You'll get a lot more mileage out of the game that way.\n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend this to anyone who already likes simulators, and even to those who don't. It's a relaxing, and frustration-free experience. It might just be the change of pace you're looking for.

Just look at my playtime. the reason this game is so popular is because it simulates driving a truck really nicely, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is one of the few simulators that actually simulate well, this isnt any of the farming simulator nonsense.\n\nNow lets actually start the review here.\n\nThe physics are great, the graphics still look good in 2018 even though the game came out in 2012. There really isnt any music in the sense of a soundtrack, but you can actually listen to your favorite radio stations while trucking down the highway using the nicely designed radio menu. you can save favorite stations and map buttons to changing the station and adjusting the volume without opening a single menu. \n\nThe game is not amazingly well optimized, but it runs pretty good on a high-medium spec PC. I get a solid 60 FPS using a GTX 1080 and I7 6700 playing at 4000x1080 (dual monitors) at ultra settings\n\nthe gameplay is divided into 3 parts. part 1:be a company driver where you drive a truck you dont own. part 2: buy your own rig and start making more money. part 3: upgrade current garages or buy new ones, hire drivers and give them trucks so they make money for you. The game dosent really have a end game, you just drive a truck for hours and hours. The system for managing drivers isnt that detailed, but it allows you to micro manage your drivers and train them any way you like.\n\nThere is a leveling system in the game, you start at level 0 and can progress into an absurd amount of levels, I tested with cheat engine and there is atleast 1500 levels. each time you level up you unlock a skill point which you can put into skills like long distance, urgent delivery and ADR (stuff like gasoline and dynamite). at level 36 you have maxed out your character.\n\nNow Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a cheap game that is amazing, but can it be even better you might ask? we get free updates for a game that is 6 years old, those are completly free and adds stuff like new trucks and trailers to reworks of the current map. But if you want the real good stuff, you gotta buy some DLC. there is ALOT of DLC for this game, but I recommend start out with getting all the map expansions, they are highly detailed and adds alot the the game. Map DLC's adds the area of scandinavia,Italy, France and mutch more. Then afterwards get some of the cargo DLC. This just adds new trailers for you to haul around, nothing more, but atleast its fun hauling a helicopter or a huge bulldozer. after you have gotten the map and cargo DLC's get some tuning DLC for the trucks. add everything from new tires to paintjobs. I own every single DLC for this game, and I can honestly say yes it is totally worth it.\n\nNow you might think \"I cant afford all this DLC, is there no sweet content for me? D:\" well the game has steam workshop support that adds stuff that ranging from physics and graphics to make your truck retarder sound like spongebob (yes im actually serious about this) You can download all kinds of mods, and the game just handles it really well. at most I had about 120-130 active mods, and the game worked perfectly fne.\n\nThe game have support for steering wheels and other extra controllers. if your gonna spend alot of time in this game, get a steering wheel. The game just becomes so mutch easier with a wheel or controller.\n\nNow this review has gotten long so lets do a summary. This game is amazing in pretty mutch every way. I have played for 1215 hours as I write this, and I could easily double that during 2019. This game is not the game you want if you want to kill zombies or drive a car at 200 MPH, but if you want a fun, relaxing game to have a good time with you should get it. \n\nETS2 has been on the trending list for simulators on steam for years, and I know why. the reason is this game isn't a 10/10. it deserves more. its more of a 15/10.

See Conclusion[/h1]\n\n[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]\nEuro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) is a 2012 vehicle simulation game developed and self-published by SCS Software. It features a massive game world spanning most of mainland Europe, the British Isles, and Scandinavia with each of the cities being connected by the beautifully recreated road systems such as the German autobahn roads.  The game also offers detailed simulation mechanics for hardcore sim players while also offering an alternative 'automatic' mode for the more casual players or beginners such as myself.\n\nAlthough the game's primary and obvious gameplay mechanic consist of driving across Europe, it does feature additional mechanics to give the game a little more spice such as; a progression (level up) system where each level unlocks new cargos, trucks, upgrades and delivery conditions; Truck Company Management system where you manage a trucking company by purchasing / upgrading garages, trucks and hiring drivers to use them.  \n\nStart the game as a driver for hire and earn enough money to build your own trucking empire that will span the entirety of Europe.\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n+ Beautiful graphics with detailed truck interiors, world environment, and road systems\n+ Good sound effects and assets\n+ Europe is vast and well detailed  giving individuality to each location you visit\n+ Good selection of trucks with a good upgrade and customization system\n+ Various cargo and delivery conditions\n+ Surprisingly contains a relevant progression (level-up) system\n+ Garage and Truck Company management system\n+ Offers different game modes to cater for both hardcore sim players, casuals, and beginners\n+ [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=401036567]Easy modding capabilities[/url]\n+ Very fast load times (Even on a mechanical hard drive)\n+ Live European Radio Streaming or custom music playlist using the in-game radio feature\n+ Has a demo in the Store page for anyone who's not sure if this genre is to their liking\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n- Some micro-stuttering despite the FPS being above 60\n- Low number of pedestrians makes some parts of the cities a bit empty\n- Poor reward for manually parking a trailer (they could have at least given 100xp for it)\n- Anti-aliasing is limited to only MLAA\n\n[h1]NEUTRAL:[/h1]\n+/- The game's overall concept is for a narrow/niche audience.\n+/- The AI needs to attend a Road Courtesy and Discipline class. (Although this does add to the immersion since the player will have to exercise due diligence while driving)\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n[b]GREAT SIMULATION GAME.[/b] Playing this game is surprisingly stress relieving and gives off a zen-like feeling while also offering a lot of other contents within the game world. \n\n\n[h1]WORTH IT?:[/h1]\nI can [b]RECOMMEND[/b] this game at full price if you're a hardcore simulation fan but if not, I suggest you purchase this game on a sale. Either way however, I [b]HIGHLY RECOMMEND[/b] purchasing the [url=http://store.steampowered.com/sub/64904/]Delux Bundle[/url] which includes all available DLCs and Expansion Packs as well as SCS' other games such as Bus Simulator, Trucks & Trailers, and Euro Truck Simulator (1).\n\n[h1]FINAL NOTES:[/h1]\nTo be completely honest, I didn't think much of this game when I first bought it because I did not see the appeal in driving trucks around in a game without a plot or a story. I was, however, pleasantly surprised on how much I enjoyed the experience because what the game lacks in story (being a simulation game and all), it makes up for in solid gameplay, excellent presentation, and player-friendly game mechanics. \n\nThe game carries with it a relatively high system requirement so be sure to check that out before making a purchase.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n[h1]Like my Reviews?

Now i gained a lot more hours on it :D\nBack then my Review was not very detailed and  since then [i]Euro Truck Simulator 2[/i] got updated constantly and has much more to offer by now, i decided to redo my review. So let's begin shall we? :3\n(For those who don't want to read a book and expect a review in form of an IGN Joke - 10/10 would relax again)\n\n[h1]The General Idea of the Game/Whats it about[/h1]\nThe easiest answer would obviously be \"Driving Trucks\" B-But wait! That's not all there is to know silly. This game is in all reality a \"Relax and listen to a Podcast/Music while you drive Simulator\". This game is about you, your truck and an open Europe to travel across. How you do it, what trucks you will drive, what cargo you will haul or the places you will see is all up to you. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\n[b]Game Start and Quick Jobs[/b]\nThe game starts you off as a hired driver. You have no money, no truck and only a rusty empty garage to work with. So what do you do? You work your butt off with \"Quick Jobs\" In these jobs you will get put inside a truck and just drive to the destination. In this starting phase of the game your goal should be to make as much Money as possible and of course to level up (More to the level system below). \n\n[b]Freight Market and your own Truck[/b]\nAfter you are level 6 or 7, which is about 2 hours in the game, you finally have enough Money to buy your first truck!\n(You could also take a bank loan and do it faster. This is where the game starts to become fun and somewhat addicting. There you sit. In your own little truck, in your rusty garage. What now? Now you can start making the big money. Instead of getting hired for an apple and a hug, you will now be paid directly by the Companies. All that freight money goes into your pocket. So you select a freight from the \"Freight Market\" Unlike \"Quick Jobs\" you will not just spawn in place. You have to physically drive to the loading spot. So don't choose something on the other side of the Country because you will have to drive there. This will be your life from now on. You pick a job, you drive to the loading dock, pick it up, and deliver it to the destination. Then you will get paid, and based on how you did you will get rated with XP to level up. \n\n[b]The Level System:[/b]\nAs mentioned many many times above. The game has a level system. You earn XP to spend in the following categories to unlock freight and boost income.\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Skill[/th]\n        [th]Description[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]ADR[/td]\n        [td]Lets you haul more dangerous cargo like gasoline or toxic stuff[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Long Distance[/td]\n        [td]Lets you take on jobs with a longer distance which will be higher paid[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]High Value Cargo[/td]\n        [td]Expensive equipment such as diggers and forklifts[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Fragile Cargo[/td]\n        [td]Glass, Cars, Electronics and so on[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Just-in-time Delivery[/td]\n        [td]Deliveries with a shorter but more rewarding deadline[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Ecodriving[/td]\n        [td]Makes your trucks consume lesser fuel[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nIn addition to your own skillset, your hired drivers will also level up in these. Which makes a level 30 driver far more productive than a rookie. Hired drivers brings us to the next aspect: Management \n\n[b]The Management Aspect[/b]\nAfter you made some Money, leveled up, bought more trucks and upgraded + bought new garages. You should start hiring drivers on your own. They will deliver cargo for you, just like you do. You equip them with a truck and they will bring in money. At first very little, up to 1000\u20ac. But soon you will have lots of drivers, and the higher their level, the more money they will make you. In the late game you will have so much money that you don't know what to do with it. Which is one of my biggest concern about the game. Once you reach a certain point you will just never run out of money. You will have millions and millions. Which makes it so the late game is literally only about the driving aspect. Which is not a major problem for me, but it might be for you, so please keep that in mind.\n\n[b]Tuning[/b]\nAs your level grows you will unlock more trucks and more parts for you to customize your truck with. You can even install mods that add more tuning parts. (Like you can install mods for basically everything in this game) You can also upgrade the trucks of your hired drivers, though that doesn't really do much since you won't see them on the road. :D\n\n[h1]Graphics, Audio and Performance[/h1]\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nDon't expect Crysis. But the game looks beautiful enough in my opinion. The weather effects just got overhauled and I catch myself sitting there thinking \"What an amazing View, lets take a Screenshot of that\" far more often than in a lot of other Games. The Truck models look beautiful and they are all fully licensed. The Dashboards all are functional and you really feel the love SCS (the developer) has put into them. I had some odd Shadow bugs earlier on but it seems they have been fixed since then\n\n[b]Audio[/b]\nThis is one of the strongest aspects of this game. To be fair, SCS improved quite a lot here as well, compared to when the game was first released. From the sound of rain dripping on your cabin, to the rumbling of a thunderstorm, the sounds are just beautiful. The trucks themselves sound amazing! And not just the engine sounds, also the little levers in the truck itself has sound, and it just helps to immerse you in this game so much. Only the beeping sound. when you reverse from inside the cabin is way too loud in my personal opinion. I have never used a sound Mod since playing this game. I know they exist, and of course I use them for modded trucks but i never used one that changes the original sounds, but i just never felt the need to do so.\n\n[b]Performance[/b]\nNow i have to say my PC is one of the weakest. I'm still using an old ATI HD4650 and a dual core processor, but I can get the game to a steady 30-35 FPS (20 in cities) on Medium Settings. If you use mods, especially big ones, such as the ProMods Map or the TSM Map, that number will obviously decrease, but I'm very happy with that aspect of the game.\n\n[h1]Pros and Cons + Verdict[/h1]\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n+ Fun and Relaxing Driving\n+ Fully Licensed Trucks\n+ Customization\n+ Big and Active Modding Community incl. a MP Mod\n+ Decent AI\n+ Amazing Audio\n+ Great Performance\n+ Good Looking\n+ Full Steering Wheel and Controller Support\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n- Late Game far too Easy\n- Managment Aspect not deep enough\n\n[b]Verdict[/b]\nIts one of my favorite driving games and the fact that I can only find 2 flaws with it makes me give it a strong 95%.

This is where the game truly opens. With your own truck you can drive around anywhere in the map and explore it as you please.

Initially I was turned off by this game because of the whole 'truck' thing. I love the idea of travelling hundreds of miles on an open-ended map, but I don't care much for trucks. I'd rather drive a car. That said, I tried out the demo (hey, I've got nothing to lose) and got hooked immediately. \n\nWhile still not a totally realistic simulation of a truck driver, I learned that driving a truck is nothing at all like driving a car but I had gotten used to it quickly (gotta go wide when turning). \n\nThe best part of the game is when you're actually out on the road. With your own MP3s playing (or one of the many radio streams you can turn on), and miles of open road in front of you, ETS 2 is the ultimate game to unwind. If you're all stressed out (from work, etc), play this game. There's no aliens to kill, or kittens to run over. It's just you chilling out in  your truck (with your cargo if you have a delivery) while singing Animaniacs songs (no really, that's one of the music I listen to while on the road) off key.\n\nRain effects are really good, although there's no other types of weather. The maps aren't exact representations but they are perfectly balanced enough so that those long jobs (say from Warsaw to Aberdeen) don't feel that long.\n\nCities aren't that interesting, but you rarely spend much time in any anyway, as you're mostly on the road. Going East (the DLC) adds much improved cities though,\n\nSome of the roads are questionable, and there's no penalty for delivering cargo earlier than the scheduled time, which are some of the little flaws in an otherwise excellent package. \n\nForm your own truck company, buy trucks and hire drivers to drive those trucks. Expand by buying garages for your company. Take deliveries and earn experience and money, or simply drive around in free roam and let your drivers do all the work.\n\nIgnore all the people who scoff at this game. I haven't heard of anyone in forums, etc, who, after playing the demo, -didn't- buy it afterwards. It's engrossing and the relaxation factor is high. SCS Software has been making truck driving games for years, so they sure know what they're doing. ETS 2 is the best of them all.\n\nP.S. American Truck Simulator is in the works.

I was very wrong! \n\nAfter I saw you could get a mod of Optimus Prime and his trailer, I had to play this game and a friend Alex gave it to me. I wanted to give the game a shot and it turned out to be a lot more fun than first anticipated. Maybe because one of my favourite series is Ice Road Truckers or because I like big machines.\n\nIf you want the game to be more realistic try play it with 3D turned on and you will never go back! \nIt makes a huge difference and the 3D works very well. The game is best played with Nvidia's 3D Vision technology.\n\nUnfortunately in three real time hours I managed to get four tickets for driving through a red light and no less than four speeding tickets for driving too fast with my truck. He, he, oops! :P\n\nI really like the way you can tune your truck to look even better and make it more powerful.\nAnd not to mention all the mods you can download. I have gotten a lot more respect for the European trucks and I have a lot Scania trucks besides my Peterbilt truck.\n\nThere is one thing I hate about the game: The piece of crap music in the menu. It sounds really terrible and dull. Some of friends hates the music too o0\nThe AI is not too intelligent either. \nFor example I get fined for another stupid AI card brushing my truck! \nThe brand Iveco gets me angry for some strange reason and I hate it.\n\nTry playing this game with Logitech G27 set and it gets a lot more realistic. \nTo top it off, add two additional 3D monitors and you will get an ultimate experience. I haven't played it with three monitors though, but I can imagine how cool it will be.\nPlaying with the mouse and keyboard is challenging and can be a real pain. \n\nOne day when I have enough money I'm going to have a driving license, not only for cars and motorcycles, but also for busses and trucks. \n\nBefore I began to like Transformers alot I thought rather negatively about trucks about how slow they were etc. \nBut this game has changed my opinon of trucks and I love to tune my trucks in game, especially by slabbing on some big air horns and a lot of lights, lol. Not to mention a huge roaring and rumbling monstrous engine. <3\nTuning a car has never been me and I have tried it in several games, but it doesn't interest me since I hate those cars irl :S\n\nEven though I only had a little interest in trucks, now it has affected me a lot and you should try the demo.

There\u2019s thousands of games out there \u2013 some offer compelling storylines, others offer non-stop thrills, and pretty much all of them let us escape the dull monotony and grind of daily life... And then there\u2019s Euro Truck Simulator 2. Which, unsurprisingly, is a simulation game where you drive trucks around a crude rendition of Europe. Okaaaay. \n\nTo emphasise the absurdity of things, you only need to look at the basic gameplay loop that\u2019s taking place here; you pick a job from a list of options in your area. You go and hitch up your cargo. Then you slowly trundle towards your destination, taking into account every road law and speed limit, and spending the great majority of your time on vast highways and never-ending strips of asphalt. After dragging yourself to your destination for 20 to 30 real-time minutes, you drop off the cargo \u2013 and do the whole thing again.\n\nSuffice to say, then, that this isn\u2019t for everyone; there\u2019s a good chance a few of you have fell asleep merely reading the last paragraph. If you do actually get to the point where you boot up the game for the first time, it even does a lot to try and immediately frighten you off... You\u2019re instantly met with a plethora of menus that are incredibly overwhelming, allowing you to do everything from create a profile to adjusting your X-axis sensitivity for... Well, something. The tutorial then doesn\u2019t help matters, basically stemming down to telling you \u201cJust drive the truck\u201d, and then buggering off and leaving you to work out how exactly you do that in the first place. \n\nYet give it a chance to get things rolling and \u2013 amazingly and most crucially \u2013 it really works. There\u2019s a bunch of reasons why this is the case, that go way beyond the primal satisfaction that comes with driving a hulking great big rig. For one, there\u2019s an incredibly calming sense of slow progression constantly burning away in the background, with the sat-nav in the corner of your screen always slowly ticking down the miles left towards your destination. It\u2019s surprisingly satisfying to watch the numbers keep dropping, and finally whittling a distance that seemed impossible to begin with down to nothing. \n\nSecondly, there's the option to turn on your own music while driving, or even tune in to actual radio stations across Europe. Set one of these up and hit the perfect moment, where the right song comes on as you watch the sun slowly rise and peep through the trees, and it all just feels\u2026 Right. Heck, take my word for it when I say that having AC/DC\u2019s \u201cHighway to Hell\u201d blasting out your speakers as you\u2019re racing down the road at max speed is something that\u2019s hard to beat. If you\u2019re daring, you can even pop a video or TV show up in another window and zone out... But just like real life, the chances of you suddenly finding yourself wrapped round the nearest streetlight rapidly increase if you do this. Still, it\u2019s fun to try. In the game, that is. \n\nThere\u2019s also a healthy degree of strategy mixed in as well. Your truck needs fuel and your driver needs rest, and managing the two becomes a delicate balancing act of effective time management, where you are constantly checking out your route and seeing how far you can push yourself before you literally fall asleep at the wheel. While it takes way too long if you\u2019re not wishing to put yourself in a position of extreme bank debt (so much so it actually gets a little frustrating), you can even make enough money to hire other truckers to your cause. Suddenly you\u2019re busy plotting out an empire, trucks roaming across all of Europe, and your hard work being rewarded with a skyrocketing bank account. You can even make the core game more complicated, if you\u2019re that way inclined. An automatic gearbox might be the obvious choice, but there\u2019s nothing stopping you from having to switch through all the gears manually, or even hooking a wheel up and going totally crazy. The choice, as they say, is yours.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth pointing out all the mods that are available to enhance or change things up \u2013 from the big changes to the little tweaks, there\u2019s a lot you can bolt on to the base experience. Whether it be branding the sides of trucks with famous logos, or subtly changing the map and the way your truck handles, there\u2019s a lot you can tinker about with if things are starting to feel a little dry. Special shout out to the mod that lets you personalise the inside of your truck \u2013 because there\u2019s something irresistible about decking out your cabin with a giant BB-8 and a bunch of other nerdy bits and bobs that fill up every empty space. While not offered in the game or mods themselves (and I can't say I tried this myself), there\u2019s also means out there to take things online, hitting the road with truckers all over the world. Chances are you\u2019ll end up in a traffic jam trying to get a ferry to somewhere, but hey, whatever floats your boat. \n\nIn the end, whatever you choose to do and however seriously you take what\u2019s on offer, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is perhaps the definite chilled out experience; with everything always just coming back down to you and the open road. It\u2019s the perfect game to unwind after a stressful day, where the challenge or intensity of most other games simply doesn't appeal, and that's what makes it something so much more than something to laugh at.", "timestamp_created": 1495231063, "timestamp_updated": 1495231063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.803731918334960938", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12577008": {"recommendationid": "12577008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048064304", "num_games_owned": 524, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 9257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545713828}, "language": "english", "review": "There is a trucker in all of us.", "timestamp_created": 1413767842, "timestamp_updated": 1413767842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 530, "votes_funny": 194, "weighted_vote_score": "0.85150676965713501", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11977813": {"recommendationid": "11977813", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055278393", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449424675}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game for like 2 euros, and omfg, this game is fascinating!! imo this is the best simulator game! you can easily relax after school or work, just drivin' the truck, while listening some good music!\nI would recommend this game even for 20 euros!", "timestamp_created": 1409842487, "timestamp_updated": 1409843249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 132, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.79535377025604248", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32197687": {"recommendationid": "32197687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116686832", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1525599590}, "language": "english", "review": "Dissapointed we couldn't stop and get fast food at McDonalds or stuff and gain 300 pounds slowly over the next 10 years.\nOtherwise, oddly relaxing and realistic.\n\n9/10\n\nP.S if you dont find inner peace while playing the game, you're playing it all wrong.", "timestamp_created": 1496664527, "timestamp_updated": 1496664527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 793, "votes_funny": 258, "weighted_vote_score": "0.866934299468994141", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "44254681": {"recommendationid": "44254681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154037889", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1544061699}, "language": "english", "review": "it's good for when you're really bored or you wanna relax.", "timestamp_created": 1534691064, "timestamp_updated": 1534691064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.842993974685668945", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12583876": {"recommendationid": "12583876", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057808988", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 101024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1550791779}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Euro Truck Simulator 2 Review!

The journeys are interesting when you see the roads for the first time, and I am far from driving them all as now i have 125hrs, and have driven just under 60% of the roads. The addition of real radios in the game has been really interesting aswell and adds to the realism of the game. Being able to drive home from work listening to Radio 1 and then half an hour later be driving a 55 ton crane around Poland, while listening to the same presenter as earlier is very nice.\n\nI initially played it loads, was the most hours ive ever played in the shortest amount of time, racking up 86 hours in just under 9 days.
