It's a far cry at this point from the early city builders. This game can be almost daunting to get into, and it can be oh so easy to have everything bog down in gridlock. I've lost count of how many cities I started and threw away because my initial foundations just didn't work. A wealth of expansions and an uncountable horde of mods only adds to this complexity.\n\nBut with this complexity comes an experience that you can lose yourself in with tinkering. Tinkering with road networks. Tinkering with bus routes. Tinkering with the latest neighbourhood. Speaking of which, you can actually have those, breaking your city up into regions which you can apply different policies to or different design aesthetics. Your city can evolve into a complex patchwork of specialisations and characters. Like I just spent hours building a lovely transit-oriented development with a park and trail network at its core.\n\nAnd this is a game that has been growing, evolving, constantly adding functionality.\n\nFair warning: this game can be a bit of a beast, especially as your cities get larger.

Of course, the workshop is truly amazing for this game. One of the best if you ask me, want to make NYC? download some building styles, vehicles and a map and there you go. There are many talented workshop artists for Cities Skylines and there content is truly wonderful. Overall, if your someone who loves city building want to freely build your city, or love to add in tiny details to your work, then this is the game for you.

It plays like a mobile game padded out for PC.  Quite literally there are points in the game where wait a while is the best/only option for progression as you must rely on time to pass to generate money.  Honestly surprised there isn't a microtransaction store selling \"time warps\" for a $1 a piece.  Guides that PRAISE this game legit tell you to set up your city then run it in windowed mode while you're away to make money.  If that's the best way to play the game, the game is bad.\n\nThe city building part is only really a challenge in the beginning when the obtuse and ridiculous map designs require you to connect utilities on one side the map (sewage) to the highway entrance on the other side.  The issue is that it's so awkward that there's really only a couple real ways to do this meaning if you're playing for a challenge (that is you do NOT have infinite money on) you're stuck with the same one or two cookie cutter concepts to get a stable city early on.  After that the game ceases to be a city building simulator and beings to be a traffic simulator, with the only challenge being how do you route roads to keep things moving well enough.  The city planning aspects play little to no part at all as most everything is automatic and based on \"hurry up and wait\"\n\nThe core game is lackluster at best but as you get into it many many smaller flaws begin to show that takes it from mediocre to just bad.  The fact that things like parks must be built off a road.   The absolute lack of any kind of \"smart\" road building that leaves you relying on a trial and error method for building things like curves and circles.  Speaking of, the  fact there there's no native option to build basic shapes out of roads (an MS paint tier tool that lets you click and drag circles or squares would be massively helpful).  \n\nI could go on but it would be pointless.  I dont like this game, it feels like a video game version of modern art, that is something bland and boring presented as interesting and deep by its fans to justify their sunk time.\n\nA final note about modding.  The game is touted as being a wonderful platform for modders, and designed with modding in mind.  When Bethesda does just this its considered poor and lazy game development, why is it different here?  Why is it that basic functional structures that make the game infinitely more enjoyable to play are up to volunteers to make?   \n\nThe game truly feels like a rudimentary city building sim that was left unfinished then marketed as \"mod friendly\"\n\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/#\nOne final (actually final) thought is that if the game were pitched as what it is, a sandbox city designer, I would be generally more positive about it.  Played as a sandbox city builder with unlimited money and everything unlocked really feels like how the game was intended to be played, with the \"city builder\" gameplay tacked on and sold as the main event.   If I was sold a game where I was told  the objective was to draw and design a city while the game generated assets and \"life\" into it I would be fine, but sold as a simulator where you're trying to build a city step by step, it's absolutely garbage.", "timestamp_created": 1550799392, "timestamp_updated": 1550799392, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.440906316041946411", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49141170": {"recommendationid": "49141170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035132390", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483471747}, "language": "english", "review": "Paradox ruined CK2, EU4, and Stellaris.

As if you couldn't have guessed that already. It allows you, in its basic state (that being without DLC or mods), to create a city from a fair variety of maps, each with different things going for them such as water quantity, oil reserves, building area etc. Your task is, simply, to get as many people to live in your city, keep them happy, make it as good as you can, and make a load of money. The same as the government\u2019s job, really. Except the \"keeping people happy bit\"...yeah...\n\nThe game allows you to design and expand a city with the use of many tools such as zoning, district planning and other features that let you change the smaller, more intricate details of your city. You can set different laws within your districts to make them work more efficiently at what you want them to do. I feel like this is all done really well. I have not got any DLC's, and only recently did I get a few mods, but I don't feel like the game ever really needed them.\nOver the course of your cities expansion, you will face challenges. You must supply water, electric and road access to people, and zone your areas well to create a nice amount of residential, commercial and industrial areas. As the demand for them increases, it is expected that you appease them. You will also have to work around the formation of the land that you are on to make your city as functional and as sustainable as it can be, otherwise it will lack in efficiency, and perhaps upset the people. If they don\u2019t like your city, they will first stop paying taxes, making it much harder for you to amend your previous errors. After that, they will leave, and you will be very lonely in that ghost town of yours. And probably quite angry as you\u2019ll have to start a new game again. One problem that is hard to manage is the flow of traffic. You must make reliable and efficient road networks throughout your city, otherwise it will become stagnant. Public services such as busses will be rendered useless, nobody will be able to get to work, and emergency services will be crippled if your roads are congested all the time. \n\nAs your city progresses in size, the feature is available to you to buy more land, thus enabling you to continue your expansion. Eventually, if you are good enough at this game, you will fill the maximum amount of land you can buy, at which point, you\u2019ll probably be feeling quite proud of yourself. Well done. \n\nOverall, I would rate this game a well-earned 10/10. I can\u2019t really fault it on anything. Out of all the city building games out there, this is the most detailed and intricate, while remaining fun to play, and enjoyably challenging.

Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.

This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game, in a genre that for too long, has been deeply troubled with over-casualization, poor optimization, ill-thought out concepts, microtransactions, and general publisher shenangans.\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n\n* Excellent Performance. I find that my city runs extremely well on my laptop even as it grows. I have not really noticed any dips in performance. The game seamlessly transitions between following an entity, and zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic network.\n\n* Intuitive game mechanics. I was able to jump straight in and make assumptions about mechanics that made sense, and those were reflected in the game. As an example, I assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work (hop on the metro, then take a bus), When I tracked people, they would do this.\n\n* Full Simulation. Things just make sense, you build a dam - the water level raises. People go to the store. People go to work. The water gets dirty from pollution. I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity - it gives me context to the experience.\n\n* Free, Focused Construction. You place roads and zones freely, focused around the placement of the roads. The zones are indelibly linked to this. It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction. It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game.\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n\n* The listed city population seems much lower than it should be. My city looks like it should be about 100,000 people, but the listed population is only 30,000. \n\n* Not enough snapping options. This makes it really hard to make your own cloverleaf in highways if you are particulary OCD about this kind of thing, it's almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedly.\n\n* The Metro + Bus placement lacks feedback and is difficult to expand once done. I feel that you are really fairly blindly approaching this, at least at the start. Over time I might grow to understand this more. Also the numbers don't often line up well. My metro station might say \"100 per week\" but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metro.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nIf you like citybuilders, buy this game. Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much. I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept.

Also snowmaps, snowplows and snowpiles, more edicts and heating systems. \n\n[i][b]Verdict[/b][/i]: In my opinion, the DLC's are not worth it at their full price. Yes, they serve to enhance gameplay and also act as a way for you to support the developer's as well. With the little amount of content that both of them offer, however, and at $12+ price tags, I'd say your money would be better spent elsewhere. So, either wait until the DLC's are cheaper (I'd say under $8 would be more appropriate), avoid the DLC's completely, or just splurge because you want to. If you're an achievement hunter like me, then you'll need to purchase the DLC's. \n\nIf budget is an issue, then I would suggest getting [i]After Dark[/i] first. It has been much more enjoyable due to it's far more superior offering of content. Quite frankly, I haven't even really played with [i]Snowfall[/i] since it doesn't offer much beyond its name. It's completely up to you!\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Realistic traffic please! (There is a mod for this though)\n- Can there be an undo button? It would be extremely helpful\n- Connecting roads can be a real hassle at times, especially when you're looking to upgrade them\n- Would be very useful if we could just upgrade buildings for a fee, such as the Cargo Harbour to Hub (without having to go through the process of destroying it first)\n\n[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]\n\nAll in all, [i][b]Cities: Skylines[/b][/i] is honestly one of the best purchases I have ever made to date on Steam. I've already lost 22+ hours since my purchase 4 days ago, and it has left me impressed each time I've exited the game. If you're into simulators, I highly recommend this one - I hope it leaves as much of an impression on you as it has on me.\n\nWith an abundance of content and a plethora of mods being developed (or already developed), you seriously can't go wrong with this title. Bravo, [i]Colossal Order[/i] and [i]Paradox Interactive[/i], bravo: thank you for this amazing game.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n9.5/10\n\nIf you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask - I will answer them to the best of my ability. On that note, cheers and happy building!\n\n[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]\n\n[b]Update 11 June, 2016[/b]: FREE STADIUM DLC! Thank you, [i]Colossal Order[/i] - this game just gets better and better. You never fail to impress with the amount of dedication and love you have for your game.\n\n[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]\n\n[h1]Worthy Questions & Answers[/h1]\n1) Can this game be played offline (credits to ru): Yes, yes this game can be played offline! I've done around  7 hours of gameplay offline (due to power outages). That didn't stop me from getting on this game though!\n2) Does the game require a lot of attention (credits to ru): the great thing about this game is that, while it does require micromanagement, it doesn't necessarily need a lot. You can leave the game in order to run an errand if you choose. I've left it for around 10 minutes before - always came back to a 99% operational city (those dead bodies, yo.

Then I found this game, and my life is complete.\n\nSome of the things worth noting:\n- The UI is simple but intuitive, it doesn't have that featureless feeling some of the plainer UI's have.\n- The game itself runs incredibly well, however you do need a good processor and a few GB of RAM to play it idealy.\n- Gameplay is silky smooth and addicting, no glitches or anything. There's even a little in-engine physics to things like cars, rivers and trees.\n- Road design is incredibly free and grid layouts are 100% accurate, unlike 2013's Simcity.\n- Full workshop and in-game modding support with an expanding community and many interesting items and maps to choose from, Copper Creek on the workshop is my favorite.\n- This list just goes on and on...\n\nThe only thing I can really notice being undesirable (to a small extent, it's not really a big deal) are things like garbage and deathcare. They tend to get overwhelming and lots of weekly money needs to be spent to fix them. (When your landfills are full or more people are dying than you can transport to a cemetary kind of thing) I'd recommend finding something better on the workshop or using the asset editor to lower/raise some gampleay values in those buildings slightly.\n\nJust a fair little heads up to newcomers, your citizens in this game are born, age, and die eventually. Don't worry though, they'll be replaced by their children for the largest part. But there may be a point in the game where a lot of people suddenly die and it's a little scary. This is because of your senior citizens getting a little too old. if you know what I mean. Be sure to prepare for this if you find it to happen, I am not completely certtain if it's just that playrhrough of mine of if it's actually a phenomenon within the game.   :P\n\nTo sum it up and make it nice and short for you, this game really is a worthwhile investment and it honestly, coming from someone who's a dear city-builder fan, steps on all the other titles and I mean ALL of them.

Where Maxis managed to somehow fail in a genre they pretty much invented, Colossal Games and Paradox Interactive have treated Maxis\u2019 effort as a treatise on what not to do.\n\nThis is, without a doubt, the game Sim City 2013 should have been.\n\nFirst up, the graphics. Skylines is very well optimized, with large detailed cities bustling along with no hiccups, and some nice options in the settings to fiddle with if you do experience any problems. The game looks great, with lots of detail. Buildings grow and \u201clevel up\u201d as you watch, changing their value and appearance and attracting different types of people and businesses. You can easily identify different areas and specialties, as well as transport, power and sewerage systems by colour using the (mostly) intuitive UI. Clicking on people, houses and buildings will give you more details, and identifying problems (or successes) is made very easy.\n\nThe gameplay is where Skylines shines, however. You\u2019ll be juggling residents needs and wants by ensuring access to clean water, power, efficient transportation, entertainment and medicine, to name just a few. You\u2019ll have to control pollution, both physical and noise, crime and disease. There are a variety of ways to do this, how you go about it is up to you.\n\nYou\u2019ll start by placing roads. Then zone areas off the roads into a category: Residential, Industrial, Retail and Office. Then set up a functioning power grid and clean water/waste water sewerage system. After that, it\u2019s all about placing public services to attract more people, and expanding your city across the map. And what a map! You initially start on each map with a 2 square kilometre parcel of land in which to build, but can expand out over 8 such parcels out of 25 available per map. That said, it is trivial to mod out the limitation, and if your computer can handle it, you absolutely can build on the entire map. As a bonus, if you don\u2019t like any of the premade maps the game ships with, you can easily use the in-game map editor to create (or recreate!) your own map to play on. There is even an asset editor too, so you can create and modify the in game assets to your preferences.\n\nThe game systems make sense, and work how you\u2019d expect them to. This is a simulation game, after all! After you\u2019ve finished zoning your city, you can then create districts, which allow you to apply policies city wide or just to select areas. Make the CBD have compulsory smoke detectors and free public transport, while giving the poor and destitute section of town a rebate on green energy. Ban heavy vehicles from residential areas to lower noise and decongest traffic!\n\nIndustries will make you money, but require careful planning. Take advantage of natural oil reserves, mine ore, farm, cut down your forests or simply go for \u201cGeneric\u201d, where you\u2019ll be making random stuff. The finance and taxation system is easily understood and superb. \n\nThe game models traffic behaviour very well and in fact figuring out a way to manage high density traffic is one of the hardest aspects of playing Skylines. To that end, you\u2019re given plenty of options, such as numerous road types, public transport, cargo ships, trains and aeroplanes.\n\nSurprisingly, the game has an incredibly effective water simulation too; Dams will burst and water flows realistically throughout the map, and pollution will be carried downstream with currents.\n\nThe icing on the cake for Cities: Skylines is the fact that Skylines is 100% mod friendly, with integrated Steam Workshop support. People have already uploaded thousands of custom maps and assets to the workshop, as well as gameplay tweaks and it\u2019s pretty safe to say that if you find something wrong with the game that you think could be better, there is a very good chance that there is already a mod for it on the workshop.\n\nNow you\u2019ve heard me gush over how great this game is, what are the cons?\n\nThe game doesn\u2019t auto-save! This is a real pain if you mess up. But, there is a mod for that.\n\nThere is no day/night cycle, which would have been nice. But, there is a mod for that.\n\nThe camera doesn\u2019t let me go low enough to get a good look of my city streets up close. But, there is a mod for that. There is another one that enables a First Person View from and person you click on in the street!\n\nNot a lot of maps to choose to play on. But, the workshop has hundreds available, downloaded and added to the available maps with a single click.\n\nThere is even a mod that allows you and a friend to explore your cities in First Person online, using the in game people as avatars. Why? Who knows! But it\u2019s possible!\n\n\nIn conclusion, if you like city builders or simulation games, you cannot go wrong with Cities: Skylines. It is everything you could want out of this genre.\n\nSim City, eat your heart out.", "timestamp_created": 1429873788, "timestamp_updated": 1429874022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 425, "votes_funny": 38, "weighted_vote_score": "0.946161210536956787", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15062103": {"recommendationid": "15062103", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993268828", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 3557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516224498}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me give you a history lesson.  \nIn 1989 Simcity was relased.

As a SimCity player since the 1989 original, I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on this thing. I\u2019ve spent about 40 hours on it so far, so the question is: does it succeed in its goal of topping SimCity? Well, in a word, YES.\n\nAs is tradition, you start with a blank plot of land and a set of tools at your disposal. Generally the goal is to build a city, grow it as big as you like, and make sure it doesn\u2019t die. You have a single highway connection to start out with, which acts as the first of many entrances to your city. Use the road tools to draw some roads, and you\u2019ll see that you get groups of tiles extending from the side of them. These tiles can be filled with three types of zones: residential, commercial, and industrial, which will become homes, shops, and factories. Although more come into play later on, like high-density residential and commercial zones, as well as office zones, the central system of RCI demand is very much in play here. The more demand for a zone you have, the more people will move in to fill those zones and the more service buildings you'll require, so you\u2019ll want to balance their placement with the other needs of the city. Beyond these basics, it\u2019s totally up to you as to what\u2019s next.\n\nAnd thankfully you\u2019re not limited to your initial map size. That starting plot of land is 2 square kilometers, but once you start reaching its borders, you have the option to buy more, up to 36 square miles worth (more if you mod the game with the excellent tile mod on Steam.) Although, sometimes the game gets a bit bogged down in ambiguities regarding its logic, mostly regarding traffic, services, and lack of UI information. But once I started to figure these systems out, the challenge in fixing them was hugely rewarding. Cities XXL and SimCity 5 were entirely too easy, and if you screwed those cities up, that was a real feat of ineptitude. Here, a doomed city can arise from something as simple as building an intersection instead of a multi-lane traffic circle, and that\u2019s kind of awesome. But it doesn't feel cheap, it feels like something to learn from and perform better next time. There are also some included mods from the developers, which act as cheats and difficulty settings in lieu of more traditional menu options. And on top of that there's an incredible potential for user-made mods, with a full blessing from the developer to do so with the included Steam Workshop support.\n\nLet me just say it: This is the game I\u2019ve been craving since SimCity 4. My few complaints are just drops in a sea of truly satisfying gameplay. It\u2019s the kind of game that I can play for so many hours at a time that when I leave, I start seeing zone layouts in my ceiling, and traffic patterns in my cereal. Just give me a pot of coffee and watch me while away dozens of hours creating the perfect balance of land value, city services, and mass transit systems and be completely content. It\u2019s blissful, stressful, and compelling on a level that few games ever achieve for me anymore. There are so many details that I love, like the way you can paint zones with different brushes, the sweeping orchestral soundtrack, the guidelines that appear when placing roads, the fact you can flood your city if you dam a river improperly, the way any zone has buildings that fit into any plot shape, and on and on.\n\nAnd it runs great too, even when surpassing 100,000 citizens, it still played solidly with minimal frame rate issues on both my desktop and laptop. Colossal Order pulled off a true colossal order here: they made a better SimCity than Maxis could (requiescat in pace.) And all this with a comparatively small budget, a team of a dozen or so people, and the Unity Engine. Just... wow. Cities Skylines is a total slap in the face to SimCity 5, and man is it a beautiful thing to behold. And the price... you get twice the game at half the price of its rival's launch price. Folks, this is what I like to call \u201cdoing it right\u201d. They could\u2019ve charged double and I still would recommend it, but wow.

Unfortunately, we have been left wanting for nearly a decade. Yes, its been that long since a really decent sim has been released. Upon learning that one of my favorite publishers, Paradox Interactive, had a City Building simulation in the works I knew this was a game I could not wait to get my hands on. Paradox Interactive is known for being a leader in challenging and entertaining  strategic games so I felt if anybody could do it right, they could. Having been able to test the game for almost a full week before its official release I can say that my trust was not misplaced. Cities Skylines is everything I hoped it would be. This is city building done right.\n\nI have played most every City Building game ever made and consider myself somewhat of an expert in the genre. Perhaps I am over-critical at times when it comes to my favorite gaming genre but it comes from the desire to find the Holy Grail in city sims. I can honestly say, Cities Skylines is far and above, the best city building simulation ever made. Period. Colossal Order has come up with a recipe that ingenuously combines just the right amount of simplistic game design with a flavorful amount of challenging gameplay to create a masterpiece. Fans of City Building simulations will definitely not want to miss grabbing this game.\n\nThere is a very realistic feel to this game. Its not just about throwing out color-coded building zones, but more about true city management. Do things right and your populus will be greatful and steadily grow. Do things poorly and your city will clear out faster than a zombie apocalypse could make it happen. Numerous tools are at your disposal as expected with an interesting dynamic that truly brings the realism into the game. Cities can be carved up into different districts and each district can have its own set of policies and characteristics. Players even choose the names. But it doesn't just stop there. Players can give custom names to just about everything in the game including its citizens. \n\nTransportation and pollution will be key challenges as with any game of this type. Having experience with previous endeavors like the Cities in Motion series, Colossal Order has easily found a way to challenge players along these lines. Cars and trains, ships and planes. Cities Skylines has it all. The water simulation is spectacular as well. Placing your sewage disposal upstream, for example, could result in contaminating your citizens' water supply. Realistic flooding is another possible scenario. The maps included are gigantic and beautifully designed terrains that offer endless possibilites when planning your city and continued population growth unlocks the ability to expand to adjacent tiles on the map as well as making more buildings and options available (such as taking out loans). These options are tied in with overall success and not just simply from having enough funds available, a feature which definitely enhances the experience.\n\nI could go on and on about all of the things I admire about this game. The graphics are solid but not overly done which allows for most systems to be able to run this game smoothly. The UI is easy to use and understand. The \"Chirper\" social media feature is a clever modern touch that keeps mayors abreast of public opinion and concerns. And, perhaps one of this game's best features is the inclusion of asset and map editting tools to allow the Steam Community to heavily mod this game in order to continue its growth and stability in the future while adding tons of extra content and replay value. \n\nIn fact, about the only area I found lacking in this game is not having a variety of random events such as natural disasters. I cannot say with certainty why the developers chose not to include them and perhaps they will be added later as DLC since most Paradox Interactive games are known to offer quality additional content long after initial releases. The modding community could possibly offer them as well, since I predict the Steam Workshop will quickly fill up with a large variety of added content. Fires, floods, pollution, infrastructure and transportation issues are still more than enough to keep players challenged and fully engaged though, so overall its not really a major concern.\n\n[h1][b]The Good:\n========[/b][/h1]\n[i]+  Solid graphics and rich detail\n+  Realistic simulation elements\n+  Challenging gameplay with various difficulty settings\n+  Variety of buildings\n+  Many customization options\n+  Easy-to-use UI\n+  Extremely high replay value\n+  Mod-friendly with editting tools included\n+  Steam Trading Cards & Achievements\n+  Pleasant audio/background music[/i]\n\n\n[h1][b]The Bad:\n======[/b][/h1]\n[i]-  Lack of random events/natural disasters\n-  Graphics could be more life-like\n-  Terrain cannot be changed during actual gameplay[/i]\n\n[h1][b]Final Thoughts:\n===========[/b][/h1]\nCities Skylines is the best City Building simulation developed in a long time and quite possibly the best ever.

Its definitely worth the price and I highly recommend this game to all fans of simulated strategy/cty building games.\n\n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1426033744, "timestamp_updated": 1435097410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 622, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.953451693058013916", "comment_count": 36, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15151090": {"recommendationid": "15151090", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997363360", "num_games_owned": 767, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 2453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512639584}, "language": "english", "review": "This is definitely the SimCity successor.

It's the best in generations. BUT, like any other game, it has it's downfalls too.\n\n\nMAP SIZE: 10/10\nThe city size is HUGE. At first you start out in a 2kmx2km area, but you can expand to a total of 9 of them, for a 18x18km area or 324 km or 201 mi area. Another pluside is that there are already mods to expand your city size to a total of 25 tiles, for a 50x50 km area, 2500 km, or 1553 mi area. The size of this doesn't make your computer lag, either, unless you don't meet the minimum requirements for the game.\n\nAI: 7/10\nThey all have diverse personalities, and you can explore the lives of each of them. The only problem is the traffic. It's terrible: If there all 6 lanes available, they will all go in one lane. Genius.\n\nINTERFACE: 9/10\nThe interface is great. It is just a little cluttered.\n\nHOW IT RUNS: 10/10\nIt runs extremley smooth and only starts to lag when you have HUGE cities. For an example, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVoP1Um95Sg&list=UUZYqx1ak0C-YKhUQY6QtxDQ\n\nTHINGS TO DO: 9/10\nThere is a LOT to do, from perfecting neighborhoods to fixing water pipes. The only reason I knocked 1 point off is because there are no disasters, which in my opinion is something required for a city building game.\n\nDIVERSITY: 9/10\nThe only reason it is 9/10 is because the building colors are almost identical and painted-looking. Despite this, you can model your own buildings :)\n\nDIFFICULTY: (not how hard the game is) 9/10\nThe only reason it is difficult is when you get to huge cities it becomes literally difficult with everything in your face all at once.\n\nGRAPHICS: (for the average graphics of the time of the release date) 9/10\nThey are amazing. I've seen better, but it is still great. It has it's own style.\n\nCLUTTER: 8/10\nUgh, when your in a city trying to build, pop ups everywhere makes it hard to work..\n\nPRICE: 10/10\nFor this great of a game, it is very cheap at the time of it's release.\n\nOVERALL SCORE:\n90% To Perfect\nWould I recommend this?

I'm an asset creator for this game, which is to say I make custom Workshop content so people can have something interesting and different to look at in their cities. I am not the best asset creator for this game - but I really love doing it. \n\nIf Cities:Skylines didn't exist, I wouldn't have bothered to learn how to create 3D game assets and models, texture said models, nor would I have met some fantastic people who share the same interest. I've always loved city builders, all the way back since SimCity on the SNES - and this one really scratches that itch. The enthusiasm and diversity of this community can not be understated. As a Canadian, I've met people from the U.K., Kazakhstan, Russia, France, Japan, the U.S. - and some of my fellow countrymen - and all have shared that enthusiasm. In terms of a competent and accommodating community, Cities:Skylines is hard to beat.\n\nAs a city builder, it's competent. It is better than the latest SimCity (2013), which is part of the reason why this game did so well. But it's not without its flaws. The thing is, though, like all cult classic games, you won't have a reason to complain about anything until you're deep enough in to call yourself a fan.\n\nThe base game is worth the price of admission outside of a sale. You should experience it if you have any interest in city builders. As it is a Paradox published title, there is a considerable amount of DLC, which some, sometimes, including myself, find disagreeable. My recommendation here is to purchase the After Dark and Mass Transit DLCs at any cost and go for the Snowfall, Natural Disasters and Green Cities when you can get them at a good price. All DLCs add something worthwhile to the game - but After Dark and Mass Transit, to me, were the most beneficial to gameplay.\n\nAlso, if you decide to purchase - ensure you have a decent supply of RAM before loading up on custom content. The minimum requirement for the game is 4gb - but I would recommend 8 (16 or more, if you can afford it. It's a Unity thing.).\n\nThe grassroots nature of Cities:Skylines is its greatest virtue. It's one of those few striking games that really exemplifies 'We, the people.' It is so many things to such a diverse crowd.\n\nSo, if you're a builder type, and you're hedging on it, you have my recommendation.", "timestamp_created": 1516001125, "timestamp_updated": 1516001125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 336, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.93423694372177124", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14861817": {"recommendationid": "14861817", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053678836", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 4104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1531482699}, "language": "english", "review": "- Modding from day one\n- Every citizen simulated\n- Agent system works on launch\n- No EXTERNAL DRM (You know, except for Steam)\n- No always online\n- No forced multiplayer aspect\n- Not published by EA\n- Published by Paradox\n- Better than SimCity\n- Half the price then SimCity when you compare them at launch price\n- Actually fun\n\nSee EA?

I made the dam directly beside the densest part of my Residential District. Water poured over the side of the dam and into the city, drowning my population and creating abandoned buildings. When the water finally calmed down it was in the form of a lake in the center of the city, halfway in residential, halfway in commercial. In an attempt to fix this I started pumping the water out (which actually seems to have worked), but I put the output in a place where it flowed into both of my main water pumps. And while I was only pumping plain water out of my city, the game counted it as waste water. I was feeding my citizens fresh water poop. So while water was killing the center of my city, poop water was killing the rest. The surge of water also managed to destroy my garbage collection, so I got this terrible mix of overflowing rivers, overflowing garbage, and overflowing sickness.\n\nAll in all an absolutely hilarious experiance.

Avoiding the mistakes made by EAs most recent Sim City release, Skylines does without an always online connection, supports large building areas and user created mods.\n\nAnd while avoiding these pitfalls, Collosal Order and Paradox have also made a very addictive and entertaining game.  You can easily lose hours making sure your bus routes are optimized and your fire departments can get to that shack down the road that keeps burning down.\n\nThe UI is clear and easy to navigate, building roads and designating zones for construction is simple, yet requires some careful planning if you want to make the \"best\" city possible. There are many tools and overlays available for viewing crime, water quality, power consumption, etc. Economy isn't overtly deep, simple sliders for taxes, and options for different policies.  For those wanting to go deeper, you can rename every citizen, vehicle, building, create districts, individually manage them, alter bus routes, and plenty more for the mayor that wants to really get down to street level.\n\nPlanning traffic routes is of prime importance in this game. Industry needs to move products, emergency services need to get to calls, and dead people need to be removed from their homes. More so than pretty much anything, you need to keep your eye on this. This isn't surprsing given the developer's history with Cities in Motion (despite being a Paradox game with a similiar name, this isn't part of the Cities XL series). \n\nGraphics look good for the genre (don't expect GTA V detailed cities), and everything is running smooth for me at a population of 45k as of this writing. The sounds are what you'd expect, nothing really stands out, and it's not annoying, fairly average. \n\nWhile the variety of options in the game is plenty, there are still some things I'm sure some people will miss from other city building games. No day or night cycle kind of spoiled my desire to see my city lit up at night. There could be a bit more variety in buildings, and public services (libraries, museums, prisons, zoos and some other notable buildings all appear to be absent). I'm sure modders will fill in this gap given some time, but I wouldn't mind paying for a hefty expansion if they decided to release more content in the future.\n\nPS: \n\nKill Chirpy.", "timestamp_created": 1426435688, "timestamp_updated": 1426435688, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 168, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.900592446327209473", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15607019": {"recommendationid": "15607019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045370334", "num_games_owned": 760, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503164989}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally, the city builder everyone was expecting, and still wanted.\n\n+ Devs who listen and care\n+ Map sizes\n+ Clean graphics\n+ Chirpy\n+ Insane modding community\n+ No seriously, the workshop for this game is bat shit crazy\n+ I just flew a plane through my city.

When SimCity Societies came out, I received it for free with another game I had purchased. I must admit... it was one of the weakest SimCity games I had played but I still put some time into it because I appreciated that the Maxis team had tried something different.\n\nThen SimCity (5) happened... I was one of those suckers that actually went out and bought a hard copy of the game the day it released. Heck I had been waiting for about 10 years and when I spent what is roughly $45 dollars I thought it was worth it because this is SimCity! I played the game for about a week and then went played SimCity 2000 instead. Yes that's right, I would rather play a game made in 1994 than one made in 2013. And when SimCity came out with an expansion pack for it a few months after release, I was done. Done with SimCity. A game that I have played and loved my entire life.

Build a city from the grounds up, managing the budget and city services for a population that is increasingly demanding as it grows. This review takes into account the [i]After Dark[/i] DLC (will update review as I acquire and play with further DLCs).\n\n[b]Pros[/b]: The game looks great with intricate models and gorgeous night-time lighting effects. The tutorial is built into the game with help cards that explain each game concepts when accessing them for the first time. These concepts are gradually introduced upon reaching certain population thresholds, which makes sense: a 1000-citizen town doesn't need a university or a subway line, so you don't get city approval to build these until the population mendates it. [i]Colossal Order[/i]'s experience with [i][url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/73010/]Cities in Motion[/url][/i] shines through the complex, but not complicated, public transport system, down to bus routes, cab depots and international airports. City budget is simple with scroll-bars for taxes and service expense, and various city-wide or district-specific policies ranging from Smoking Ban for a better city health to Legalized Marijuana for bonus tourism. Money is inflated just well enough, as either something's wrong with your city and you're losing a lot of money, or you fixed what's wrong and you're making a lot of money, preventing you from spending an eternity waiting for your money to go up a few dollars at a time (unlike some other city builder I know) or needing to change the game speed in an attempt to skip the wait. Statistics and graph tools are impeccable, you just pick category from the graphs menu or a building from your build menu, and you get stats, capacity, street coverage and building needs right in the city view.\n\n[b]Cons[/b]: You are limited to a starting map and may gradually purchase more land, and while the concept makes sense in tycoon-style games, you can unlock most land expansions pretty early and their cost is pretty low, so it feels like a cheap way to force you into starting at a particular location when you wish you could start you city elsewhere on the map. There are some weird oversights in the graphics, such as large ships that literally pass through bridges, or trees that grew under water (leaves and all). Building long roads or pipes in a straight line is also sketchy: I regularly had roads built in parallel still have the space between them shrink over distance, or have the hardest time getting both directions of a highway aligned in curves. I mean, I'm all for it when it comes to not being locked into an isometric grid, but it should allow you to build straight when you want to. Ironically, buildings and land tiles, which you may want to customize, actually ARE locked in a grid along the road. Even with a dozen alternate routes, every single car (including emergency vehicules) use the shortest road regardless on traffic jams, a problem that only gets worst as the city grows.\n\n[b]Verdict[/b]: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - Play this. Now.\n\nThe Cons may appear lengthy, but it's only because these were minor gripes that required explanation to even grasp why they are gripes. [i]Cities: Skylines[/i] is the best city builder out there, bringing everything that was fun about [i][url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/24780/]SimCity 4 \u2013 Deluxe Edition[/url][/i], equaling or surpassing most innovations [i]SimCity \"5\"[/i] brought, and adding so much of its own. If you like city simulators at all, this one is a must have.

A whole lot better when compared to the latest simcity which is plagued with many problems such as map size and DRM.\n\nPros:\n\n- Realistic water simulation; if you build your water intake down the river and the waste output up the river, you're gonna feed your citizens with poop water. And dams will alter the flow of the river\n\n- Noise pollution is taken into consideration (Can be caused by traffic, windmills, industries etc.). \n\n- District zoning (allows you to micro-manage your city easily). Policies can be introduced only to the specific districts. For example, in district 1 it is legal to use recreational drugs while in district 2 it is illegal.\n\n- Easily accesable info view where you can see the stats of your city, such as education, crimes, and so on.\n\n- Natural resource exploitation for more income.\n\n- Detailed public transportation systems which allows you to plan the routes.\n\n- Very easy to learn especially if you have played city building games such as Simcity before.\n\n- You are able to see the complaints of your citizens in a notification box above the screen which functions like twitter. This allows you to pinpoint and correct problems quickly.\n\n- Very big map sizes allows you to build metropolitan cities.\n\n- Limited service buildings are available at first but becomes available as your city grows (makes it easy for new players to learn)\n\nCons:\n\n- Road mapping can get wonky sometimes and you end up building roads that are slanted.

A balance between looking good, and performing well. While not top of the line graphics, Skylines found a sweet medium between realism and cartoony that actually works rather well. It's not distracting in any way, and you wouldn't really notice until you zoomed in close to individual cars and people. The city feels alive and bustling, and the game still performs well at large simulation levels. The interface is very, very well thought out, along with each of the overlays. It is clear they are all heavily inspired by Sim City (the good ones), which isn't a bad thing. Why fix what isn't broke? [/td]\n [/tr]\n [tr]\n  [td][b]Gameplay[/b][/td]\n  [td][h1]9.5[/h1][/td]\n  [td]This is what city-builders have been waiting for, for a long time. Ever since Sim City 4, city building games have either performed poorly, or massively under-delivered gameplay wise. Skylines has come onto the field full force, and delivers a polished, seamless world to build in, with a gigantic area to boot. Manage your water lines, power, trash, health care, leisure, and more. Of particular note are the public transit routes, refined by the former Cities in Motion games. Also of mention is the small, but wonderful ability to create districts which allow you to section out portions of your city and assign each of them unique names and policies (no high-rises, less water use, etc). Skylines took plenty of notes from the old city builder games we all loved, and refined the experience into something absolutely wonderful. They've even included a mode to allow you to play with unlimited money, and everything unlocked, so you can build without worry and create the city you've always dreamed of! The only minor frustrations that have emerged are some struggles with boats and routes for roads, but that could be my lack of patience for getting down into the nitty-gritty details of layout.[/td]\n [/tr]\n [tr]\n  [td][b]Story[/b][/td]\n  [td][h1]N/A[/h1][/td]\n  [td]No story here, besides the one you mutter to yourself as you cut off your city's water supply.[/td]\n [/tr]\n [tr]\n  [td][b]Multiplayer[/b][/td]\n  [td][h1]N/A[/h1][/td]\n  [td]No multiplayer in Cities: Skylines.[/td]\n [/tr]\n [tr]\n  [td][b]Replayability[/b][/td]\n  [td][h1]10[/h1][/td]\n  [td]This nearly comes with the territory of city building games. They always call you back to try creating a different city, or try new ideas with your layout. Or perhaps unleash havoc on the city to just...see what happens. Take all that joy, polish it, and you have Cities: Skylines, at your beck and call.[/td]\n [/tr]\n [tr]\n  [td][h1]Overall[/h1][/td]\n  [td][h1]9.6/10[/h1][/td]\n  [td]If you have been waiting for a worthy successor to Sim City 4, you have just found it. With free content updates down the road, Steam Workshop support, and developer's that listen to their audience, Cities: Skylines has everything good going for it, and my does it sing its song well. From the refined interface, to the focus upon you having control over your city, to the sheer size of the cities you can create; Cities: Skylines delivers on every front, and is exactly the city-builder game you hoped it would be. Though it isn't revolutionary in any of its gameplay elements, it has risen to the challenge that was so long failed, and now carries the torch of the city-building genre. Highly recommended, now get out there and build the city you've always dreamed of, and be sure to stop by the Steam Workshop for some neat mods!

The challenge is great, but at times you just see the little thought bubble and  you want to bulldoze that person's house.\n- Even though I paid for all of the DLC, after thinking about the purchases some of the DLC content should be integrated into the game for free.\n\nDespite it all, I love this game.

For the permanently angled view, the constant reticulation of splines, and the occasional metal monster blowing up my forests of arcologies and massacring millions of my citizens as a result, there was enough to it to make the imagination to go wild. SC3K (and 3K Unlimited/World Edition) was the same basic idea with a lot more detail, and SC4 allowed me to build bigger and bigger (Rush Hour was a neat touch too, because you could actually into the streets - not quite like Streets of SimCity, but close enough). Even Societies, which gets a bad rap because it's not Maxis - among other reasons - worked out great - perhaps even better, as your decisions on the society effected the decor quite nicely. (I tended to build Authoritarian cities, heh heh.)\n\nThen came SimCity 2013, and it seemed like a good idea to start. Except for the constant online feature, the DRM controversies, so on...and the fact that the city sizes were fixed, as opposed to the variously-sized tiles made available in SC4. It basically turned into another typical EA game - \"buy more of this, it will enhance the experience\". I was disappointed...Cities of Tomorrow was an interesting touch, but not enough to keep me going.\n\nThen I heard about Cities: Skylines. A number of people suggested the similar-yet-unrelated Cities XL (and various sequels) to me in lieu of SC '13, and when this came out, some pointed me here. I got it during the last sale about a month ago, and began building a new incarnation of my capital of capitals...and for the first time in twenty years, it felt like a real city, with real needs. I was used to the basic stuff, mainstays of most city-builders of this type - needs power, water, garbage disposal, police, so on - but in my first playthrough, I looked in the healthcare tab and went, \"Wait...cemeteries? You have DEATHCARE in this game?\" Which was kinda funny to me, as in real life, I like to explore historic cemeteries...the thought never occurred to me that maybe there could be historical cemeteries in my own cities!\n\nThe unique buildings and monuments are also a nice touch, because they're functional as well as decorative (I have them all except for the fusion plant, I need the observatory). The weather is also nice; I will have to get the Snowfall pack to see how well I can build in the snow...if it's anything like New England winter, probably not too well!\n\nWhile there is still a size limit (barring the use of mods) for your city, it's a lot larger than in SC '13, and also has a lot more flexibility than SC '13...or any other type of game like this I've played, for that matter. And the realistic details allowed me to fool my friends and family; my brother had actually thought a screencap of my city was a photograph of a real city.\n\nIn short: Loads of fun, and it's induced me to commit heresy against the Church of SimCity by building here...any fans of the golden oldies, please don't burn me at the stake.", "timestamp_created": 1477768212, "timestamp_updated": 1477768212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 141, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.892791271209716797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15094943": {"recommendationid": "15094943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119208048", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1542561509}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Q: What I think of this game?[/b]\n\nA: Best city builder game I played... ever... period\n\n[b]Q: What I don\u2019t like about it?[/b]\n\nA: Traffic does need to be fine tuned, and I feel mods are necessary to balance the game, but it's very tedious...\n\n[b]Q: What about user generated content?[/b]\n\nA: Workshop community has been very impressive, adding so many cool things to the game. \n\nI am at a point where I feel I am missing out on amazing mods and content, because there are so many to choose from, and I can't invest the time to try them all. \n\nBut how can you really complain from having too much choice, so forget I just said that...\n\n[b]Q: Does it worth the price?[/b]\n\nA: Price might seem a bit steep to some, but for any fan of city builder games, you'll get your money's worth in the first week... and probably lose a bit of grasp on reality at the same time. \n\nBottom line, you will get a lot more then what you pay for, so why wait?\n\n[b]Q: What I would love to see added to the game?[/b]\n\nA: I would like to see some scenarios of some kind being added. \n\nMilestones are great, and sandbox opens so many possibilities... yet still, I would like to have the option of being guided or limited to specific objectives.\n\nIt would help me understand some parts of the game better, and bring my game to another level.\n\n[b]Q: What are my advices when playing the game?[/b]\n\nA: The game expects you to be a pro at this; you'll have to make a lot of mistakes before you find your way.\n\nIt's easy to \"cheat\" the game, but it will not make it more fun. \n\n- Watch tutorials to get some ideas \n- Use mods with caution, they can improve the game, but can also break it... \n- Help rating user generated content, rating takes 5 seconds and creators should get recognition for their work\n- Make suggestions, Colossal Order and Paradox are listening to the feedback and are not wasting any time\n\n[b]Q: What would I like to say to Paradox and Colossal Order\u2019s team?[/b]\n\nA: You have given me what I was waiting for!

That DLC never came. The next DLC won't bring it. Unfortunately I doubt it ever will.  What made me go from that level of disappointment to really liking the game? Seeing in a new light. This game is an amazing city builder. Amazing painter of cities. If you want to create a city that looks and feels like you want it to you have that ability. Building what seems like a giant county of varied and unique zones with different looking towns and purposes is the best I've ever seen.

Review is mostly unedited (though shortened) for posterity. \n\n[url=https://kinglink-reviews.com/2018/11/23/cities-skylines-review/] Full Review[/url] --  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/dXL9aekqpL0\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to expect when I booted Cities: Skylines.  After Cities in Motion, games that focused on mass transit as their first two games, I was almost definite I was going to have a bad time as I disliked both of those games on some level. \n\nA couple hours later I was a bit surprised because the hours flew by.  I\u2019ve heard Cities: Skylines is a SimCity clone.  In reality, it\u2019s a fantastic Simcity, far better than EA\u2019s always online SimCity that they produced.  In fact, it\u2019s released two years after the SimCity release and just is better in every way possible.  No online, great gameplay, and not as many really annoying bugs (such as traffic). \n\nThat\u2019s the thing though, Cities Skylines is SimCity, if you hate the idea of city building, you\u2019re probably not going to be happy here.  If you miss classic SimCity, this is a must own.  It\u2019s not the same game, but it\u2019s an excellent replacement for it, far superior in almost every way.\n\nThe big thing in Cities Skylines is the growth of the city ties to items. When your city is a village, you can only create certain objects.  Garbage is locked until you 440 people, The Police department is unlocked at 850 people.  Want a Solar Power Plant to be green?  Get 18,000 people and not a second before that.  It actually is a great way to scope the game and let you focus on tasks right in front of you than give you infinite choices and have you build stuff you don\u2019t need but it can limit the game in the early game.  This might not be for everyone though.\n\nWhich is why there are mods, glorious mods!  The game ships with three mods if I remember correctly (I\u2019ve gotten a lot since then), the Unlimited money mod, the unlock all mod, and the hard mode mod.  The unlimited money and unlock all mods both will unlock all buildings.  But there\u2019s a LOT of mods for this game and a ton of great support through mods.  Basically, if you don\u2019t like something in Cities Skylines there is a mod for it.  \n\nBut the building system does have one thing that\u2019s quite cool.  There are unique buildings in which the player has to fulfill some minor or major task such as construct a certain type of building 30 times, or produce a certain amount of goods.  If you do that, you get a special building to customize your city with and give your city bonus usually a tourism, but they also help you build the big monuments which are awesome to aim for. \n\nSo it\u2019s like a great version of SimCity, what\u2019s different? \n\nWell, first there\u2019s a number of tools that aren\u2019t as good as others.  The road tool seems to hate perfect lines.  I want to draw perfect grids such as can be found in New York City.  Just long lines of perfect roads.  The road tool seems to hate me and I seem to fail at this often.  The roads do snap to each other at specific points, but I seem to miss the 90 degrees by a few degrees often.  I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some button to make these roads perfect but it should be easy to do this. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to do highways and such and it\u2019s sometimes a bit hard to make the connecting road matchup without an odd design. They\u2019re just something not 100 percent right with the way it creates roads, not to mention curves. \n\nThe reason you want perfect roads is that the grid for the city has little squares, and anything other than a perfect rectangle gives you spaces in the grid or little gaps that don\u2019t look too bad, but can limit growth They are minor breaks but they don\u2019t look that good and the best buildings won\u2019t be built there. \n\nZoning is well done though and it\u2019s easy to throw down different types of building quickly, and replacing buildings with services don\u2019t seem to hurt the neighborhoods much (The area around the service buildings, like a police station, recovers exceedingly fast.) \n\nThe game does add a fantastic tool that lets you build districts.  But what\u2019s brilliant here, is you can paint the district, applying almost a blob to an area so you can make your own design and rename your districts what you want.  You can also change policies specifically for that area if you want.  It\u2019s great to grow as you decide.  The management of these districts is far easier than I expected, but I\u2019m not a micromanager.  I like to run \u201cFreelandia!\u201d  where you can do what you want.  However the micromanagement with the districts is fun, and it makes your city look great. I love naming areas with different names or recreating real places I have visited in San Diego, LA, Orlando, or of course Boston.  Or just name everything after body parts.  The choice is yours.\n\nI\u2019ve always loved city building, and the experience of just watching a city grow, and that exact experience is here.  It takes some time but eventually the player gets an idea how to figure out what\u2019s going on or what problems to tackle.  Sadly the game doesn\u2019t have the best complaint system unless you look at buildings.  Anything wrong and there\u2019s a little complaint on top of a house.  There\u2019s a twitter style feed on the top of the screen that tells you random things going on in your little corner of the world, but it doesn\u2019t give a deep understanding of what\u2019s going on.  Imagine if a mayor of a town could only find out what\u2019s going on with a twitter feed.  It\u2019s a little silly, the single interactions with the populace doesn\u2019t work.  I'd have preferred an advisor telling me what are the major issues people are talking about.\n\nIn addition, the game is VERY slow.  A single day is 10 seconds\u2026 at that rate you pass a year in an hour of constant running.  That\u2019s a bit long in my opinion.  But triple speed makes a day only \u2026 5 seconds!  Wait what?  Yeah.. triple speed only doubles the time in my test.  That means a year is 30 minutes.  That\u2019s quite slow still.  I\u2019m sure it\u2019s due to the simulation time and such, but really, quite slow.  The game is focused on weekly cycles instead of monthlies but it\u2019s a very long year. \n\nThe one thing I\u2019m not a fan of here is that the game currently promotes its expansions and there\u2019s a lot.  It\u2019s starting to become like the Sims, where there\u2019s tons of content each one in its own expansion.  Luckily the game doesn\u2019t feel like you need expansions as the main game is fantastic on its own and fully featured, but if you have to have it all.  In fact, there\u2019s good quality of life additions to the game along with the expansions.  However, it feels that expansions are a bit of a mixed blessing.  You can remove DLC from Steam by uninstalling the DLC itself but in game, if they are installed they are always on.  Want to switch from a Snowfall game to a one without?  You need to uninstall the DLC. \n\nYet the player can avoid all the DLC and the game is still fantastic, it\u2019s a fully featured game with a lot of depth.  The ability to grow your city and then tackle new problems is rather refreshing as you can focus your talents on the smaller tasks even on a second playthrough.  Designing your city is easier when you\u2019re able to focus on it at first.  You can fly through the ranks quickly especially once you know what you\u2019re doing.\n\nThere\u2019s a  very solid UI as well once you learn it, and interesting challenges for the player to tackle.  There\u2019s not much here I dislike.  Even the annoyances are minor in comparison.  I plop down a few zones and I start remembering why I love this game.  It\u2019s not just that it reminds me of a great game.  It\u2019s a great game on its own.  While I didn\u2019t like Cities in Motion much, this is exactly the game I was hoping they would make, and now that it\u2019s here.  It is kind of fantastic. \n\nSo ....\n\nIf you enjoyed this review or want to see my opinion on other games you can find my curator page at this link.  http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31803828-Kinglink-Reviews/ Give me a follow", "timestamp_created": 1517988352, "timestamp_updated": 1543053392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 72, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.846997201442718506", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15041351": {"recommendationid": "15041351", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995836948", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 13510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1526180657}, "language": "english", "review": "The +'s\n\n+ Very Detailed Buildings, Roads, Cars, down to the physics in the water \n+ Huge areas of land\n+ Multiple landscapes to pick from\n+ Ton of premade worlds to get started in\n+ Trains, Boats, Airplanes, Subway, Hearses, Trash Trucks, Fire Engine, Police Car, Ambulance and a bunch more animated vehicles!\n+ Every person is doing something in the city, with cool activities like a ton of different style parks, and hey actually animate them doing it!!

This is Pablo, from SimNation.\n\nCities: Skylines goes back to the core City Builder experience of SimCity 2000, 3000, 4... and improves on it.\n\nSimulation is epic. Each citizen is simulated, with own age, workplace, home, household, education level and happines. They can even own cars. And all of this is persistent. All of them are living in your city until the day they die out of sickness or when their time comes.\nTraffic and Public transportation is properly executed as well. Heck, even water is simulated with the Fluid simulation. I think we all have seen the dams and the poop flowing by a river at the expected speed and direction.\n\nThe economic system is awesome. RCI is meaningful. Commerces import goods from the exterior, or local industries if available. Citizens must purchase different kind of goods to be happy. And all of this is executed, and you can get down to street level and see it for yourself.\n\nBuilding a city on Cities: Skylines is this long, epic journey, where you will be laying out the city infrastructure through proper city planning and engineering (the game will punish you for not making road access or dispose your sewage properly), dealing with Noise Pollution, dead body collection, and all with the right level of micro management to make you feel you are in charge. From laying down the routes of buses or metros, to defining Districts and setting unique Policies to change the way it behaves, or help a sector get back on it's feet by lowering taxes or making public transportation free.\n\nDespite the lack of polishing of many aspects of the game, from user feedback, to user interface and lack of content variety (chirps, buildings, billboards), you are not going to focus too hard on it because of all the other things the game gets right.\n\nIf you like city builders, this is hands down a safe purchase.

If yes to either, give this game a long look. The  two primary ways (soon to be three with the release of scenarios as part of the free update for the Disasters DLC) you'll probably play this game will be either sandboxing with infinite money, or more vanilla which won't use mods. \n\nWhat I love:\nScale - The maps are massive. Even in vanilla in which you have access to 9 tiles out of a possible 81, you have a massive space to develop, decorate and grow. As a point of reference, Sim City 2013 maximum city space is equal to 1 square in Cities: Skylines. As a bonus, there are thousands of player created maps in the steam workshop, some of which provide fantastic settings to grow an empire or a small rural city. \n\nLiving Cities - The people and the traffic all have a life, a destination; they're not simply arbitrary numbers detailing their supposed existence. You will be tasked to provide the infrastructure they need to live and will be critical to succeed as mayor, civil engineer, and accountant of your city.  \n\nCities: Traffic Wars - Some love it, some hate it. I love traffic wars. I love the problem solving, the beautification designing of interchanges; it's a very rewarding feeling when you solve traffic problems successfully. Nothing wrong with that. Yes, there is quirky behavior, but it doesn't detract massively from the experience. I have a couple tips: Leave space for traffic to filter and minimize weaving. That goes a long way. There are player guides that tackle how to solve typical traffic issues such as How to Traffic and even guides that look at traffic flow theory and how it applies to this game. \n\nWorkshop - Mod support and a massive amount of player content means there are enormous number of ways to build a city. Mods provide powerful options to take control, and build with massive freedom. Download responsibly and there will be minimal issues. You aren't limited to zoning and plopping, you can create beautiful, planned cities. The only limitation is your imagination.\n\nNot so great:\nDLC - A bit pricey for what you get, excluding After Dark. That dlc is excluded, and I would definitely take no issue paying full price on. Very feature rich. Unfortunately, the same level of praise is not really warranted for Snowfall. Trams and snow maps are nice, but I would not buy it full price. \n\nVanilla gameplay - As a first time experience to get achievements, it's fine in its own right, but in comparison to what you can do with the player content regarding the mods (you can use building assets, props, etc. in vanilla), the gameplay is limited and quality of life for the player tends to be lower with the lack of performance mods.\n\nDifficulty - This is a double edged sword. Lack of difficulty is beneficial to those that simply want to build, grow and show off their skills with infrastructure building, and city painting. This is a negative for anyone that wants a challenging economy in vanilla. This will hold particularly true if you like that kind of gameplay in Simcity. Fortunately, for the challenge inclined, you can make it much harder on yourself with mods, and Scenarios are coming out soon, which will provide win and lose condition scenarios as part of the Disasters dlc. It will be free.\n\nTLDR: Love building, traffic wars, the almost endless beautification options, and I can be a major creep as I roleplay God with my topdown world view  as I stalk a handsome young man coming home from work as he goes home to sleep at night (he actually does live in that house).

But I can assure you, you can stop reading reviews for this game and buy it right now (or as soon as you can). Simply put, this is the best city-builder released for more than 12 years, since SimCity 4. Half the price as SimCity 2013 but with many more features, this game is easily worth the $30 price tag. Perhaps even buy the deluxe edition for the extra $10; the developers deserve it (the game was made by a team of about ten people).\n\nSo stop reading this review and buy the game.\n\nFor those still unsure about their purchase of this game, I'll now list some of my favorite parts, many of which SimCity 2013 and other city-builders lacked.\n\n[list]\n[*]1.) One-way-roads and roundabouts\n[*]2.) Water physics: water pumps, sewage drains, treatment plants, and dams influence water levels\n[*]3.) Parked cars. Doesn't seem like this should be a new feature in city-builders, but it is. Cars park on the side of the road and in parking spots.\n[*]4.) Districts and policies: paint districts on certain parts of your city to keep track of things better and issue local policies.\n[*]5.) Mods galore. The workshop is filled with various mods and the game has an asset and map editor built in.\n[/list]\n\nHopefully that small list of a few of my favorite things has convinced you to buy the game. Cities: Skylines will undoubtedly reshape the city-building genre, and will continue to do so for years to come, as the devs have promised extended support to as much as ten years.\n\nUPDATED Sept 24th, 2015:\nFor the DLC haters out there, this game will have plenty of DLC during it's long run. However, they'll be cheap (the one just released, After Dark, is only15 USD) and add actually new things that matter. Releasing along side every DLC is a patch that adds plenty of new features for people who don't buy the DLC (in the case of After Dark, non-DLC people will still get the day-night cycle among other things for free).", "timestamp_created": 1426370961, "timestamp_updated": 1443095245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.78638380765914917", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26005574": {"recommendationid": "26005574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321445295", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 24190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1063, "last_played": 1551641751}, "language": "english", "review": "For anyone looking for countless hours of fun, this is your game.

This game is playable with lag, but will slightly impact your enjoyment of the game.\n\nOverall, Cities: Skylines is a great game.

It's fun without being overly punishing but still provides a challenge for those of us who want it. Sure it isn't perfect, but there are few games that even scratch that lofty goal.\n\nProbably the biggest issue is the lifespan of the citizens. All citizens lead a perfect and full life. This means if you have 2000 people move into your city all at once, they all die at the same time. It's really frustrating until you realize what's happening at the simulation.

I couldn't let that happen, so I bulldozed every medical clinic and hospital and replaced them with cemetaries so the citizens knew exactly what their future looked like. While more and more people got sick, the population continued to decrease by the thousands. It took no more than fifteen minutes before every citizen was dead. Every citizen except for one. While everyone else was in bed waiting to die, there was one lone garbage truck driver who was determined to do his duty to his country. He pushed through the sickness and feces and continued to collect trash from the empty houses. That man operating the garbage truck is a true hero. Even through the apocalypse, he continued to fight for this country and show the world he is truly the greatest garbage truck driver that ever lived. Shortly after, he drowned in his own shit.

You can design almost every detail including appearance of buildings, parks and other stuff, but it is only for the most fanatic players. General player population (Inc. Myself) will get with projecting town streets where the game also gives you a huge opportunity to be creative by designing every angle, every corner of the streets and planning where will be commercial, residential and industrial zones as we know it from the old Simcity franchise. You have to care about your citizens to make city prosperous, build hospitals, police offices, fire stations, cemeteries, public transport systems, roads etc. and enable easy access to these facilities.  If you do it right there won't be problems with traffic jams and that's the biggest obstacle not only in every simulator of this type, but also in real life. \n\nSo the Cities: Skylines has everything it should, but it also has another assets to offer: unlocking buildings like Hadron Collider or Fusion power plant and many more can get your attention and believe me achieving those is a long way. One of the most interesting things are districts and policies. You can divide your city into smaller districts applying another policies in different parts. For example you can lower taxes in newly developing areas to grab attection of investors or ban smoking and demand smoke detectors in industrial areas to prevent them from fire threat and many more. I really appreciated land value index by which you can deduce how different city parts are doing.\n\nThe game can entertrain you for hours and it's really fun, but there are some imperfections I have to criticize. The most significant is  once you get from the first struggles of a newly developing town, after making the first profits the game seems to me too easy, I'd appreciate some random events, all i care after that is traffic and that's what can be really annoying after a while. \n\n[b]7.5 /10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1433592220, "timestamp_updated": 1455992290, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.782828986644744873", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14881641": {"recommendationid": "14881641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042793059", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 16233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1539436829}, "language": "english", "review": "Gad damnit, this is so much fun.
