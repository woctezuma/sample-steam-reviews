It's middle of October and the last patch was released in the beginning of September, but it was pretty big, changed few things, fixed many bugs, etc. etc.\n- Optimization is bad (for some people), apparently.

And it gives you what that title promises. It's similar enough to PUBG to be entertaining. Though it obviously has less features. But hey, it's free.

Instead, try [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/578080/PLAYERUNKNOWNS_BATTLEGROUNDS/]PUBG.[/url][/h1][/quote]\n[h1]This is my first shot into Battle Royale-typed games as they are getting more recognized these days, here are my thoughts and review of Last Man Standing.[/h1]\n\nOkay starting off, this game is free to play, and that alone already is a big bonus to me. I've always wanted to try and play this kind of games ever since I quit playing csgo, but I just don't like to spend money on games I don't enjoy playing. This one, is a little bit on the luck side, and I'm just bad with that kind of stuff ;w;\nCompared to the big titles like PUBG or H1Z1, this game doesn't have much, but since you don't have to pay anything to play, honestly I think it has what's needed. There IS microtransactions in this game, like... what are f2p games without those...\nbut anyway, the paid stuff aren't really that useful and overpowered, so it's not really pay to win. You'll still find powerful pickup weapons randomly on the ground, you just have to rely on luck to find those of the better ones.\n\nThe graphics are okay. It looks a little bit outdated compared to the bigger titles, but I had no issue playing this game on the graphical side. Not sure if this game's smooth on other hardwares, but it rocks solid on my 1050. Long range vision is okay, but some texture popups do happen. I might just have to fiddle around the graphic options to hit that sweet spot between performance and graphics. Compared to games like PUBG and H1Z1, this doesn't need much to run at solid 60 framerates, but you'll be sacrificing a bit of the visual quality. UI is simple, controls are also good, you just have to dedicate some time getting used of the control layouts. Directional sounds are decent, but good luck fighting your way out in those loud machine gun sounds. The one complaint I have though, is that this game has no bullet tracers, so it's pretty tough to see where you're getting shot from. Muzzle flash are also hard to see in the distance.\n\nGame Mechanics are also great. Weapons have their own specialty, some with extreme recoil, others are just average. As usual, walking makes footstep noise, while crouching and prone doesn't. Depending on the situations, it can get very competitive. You can have like.. three of four players trying to kill you, or you can just bore yourself out camping in the buildings waiting for players to pass through. One downside of the game mechanic is the tedious travel distance. There's no accesible vehicle, so you have to walk for miles to go to the center. And while walking, you're extremely exposed to enemies, unless you go along tree lines or bushes, which is harder to spot from afar.\nOh, also the duo matchmaking thing takes forever since there aren't that many players playing right now.\n\nOverall, this game performs better than I expected, considering it's price (well, no price at all...)\nPerformance and graphics are good, menu design and game mechanics are also great.\n[b][i]BUT[/i][/b]\nHow much you enjoy it pretty much depends on the way you play it. You'll find yourself having a very tough time trying to be that Last Man Standing considering of how many people you're playing against. If you're just like me who have like... bad luck all the time, you'll pretty much get tired of dying quickly, but nonetheless, it's very satisfying once you've started to kill people and loot their dead bodies.\n\n[spoiler]unless you get killed while looting, poor you.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1506269268, "timestamp_updated": 1541447496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 170, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.839690983295440674", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40287753": {"recommendationid": "40287753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288420491", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518355097}, "language": "english", "review": "The game at the time I'm writing this review (2/21/18) isn't horrible. It needs lots of work done to it though before I would say to download it. The graphics are nice, and it reminds me of PUBG, but there are glitches. The game should also have cars, or a way to get around faster, because it has a very big map, just like PUBG. There are a lot of custumization options which you can grind for, and the guns are good. The whole item system is fine how it is now. And surprisingly, there's no pay to win aspect at all, and that's great for a free game. There needs to be an anti-cheat system added to this game though, and that's the main reason why I'm giving this game a thumbs down for now. I have experienced hackers kill me, and tons of the poeple who played this game did too. To add on to the bad side of this game, I've seen lots of people write reviews saying they experienced lots of lag, due to the servers. I barely had any, down here in North America, but the devs may want to look into better servers. This game also doesn't have a tutorial, which can be frustrating for new battle royale players. And the feel of the controls are a little bit weird. Coming from H1Z1 and PUBG, those games have a way better movement/control system. Once you get into this game though, I would think you could get used to it. I am using a GTX 1070 OC paired with Ryzen 5 1600 and it runs great on highest settings, so I don't think it will be too hard to run it.\n\nBottem Line: Wait till this game gets more updates/patches.

There should be at least a cooldown on them or a decent cast time so that when you start shooting someone he can't just instantly turn and have a shield on him. In my opinion shields should be strategically planned in advance when you are making a cover or placing it down to loot a body and not to instanlty place them when you get shot at.\n\n-When it comes to healing it is kind of nice that you can just throw it while sprinting, but it is sometimes too powerful like medkits when you get person low and he heals above half in an instant and you have to kill him again. Those heals should have a cast time at least so they have to be used under cover and not in heat of battle again.(H1Z1 system with a cast and overtime medkit is nice, but I am not sure if you wish to have the same implementation)\n\n-One more thing that kind of bugs me is the damage you can do. For a person with armour you need need a least 2 headshots and a body shot to drop him with an assault rifle(Maybe I am wrong on this, but I can't remember ever having a different experience than this). Body damage is not that bad I guess, but 2 headshots not being a kill is a bit too much I would say.\n\nOne more complaint is about the memory leek or something like that since after playing a few games in a row (maybe 7+) I would get an error mentioning the insuficient memory and after the game restart all is back to working. I have seen a few people mentioning this, but it doesn't hurt to write it down again.\n\n\n-Also, sometimes objects like those sheds next to houses don't render well so I can see people trough it ,but of course can't hit them. That can be a disadvantage for both of us because I know his position ,but I also reveal my position when I start shooting, but can't actually do damage.\n\nIn the end I would recommend this game and I have because it is extremely fun for me especially in groups, but like a lot of games it needs some work to make it just right.\n\n( I will post this as \"Yes\" on whether I would recommend the game, but that makes me uncertain if it would be read for what it is since I know that if I want to better myself I don't go around looking for people to tell me things that I do good, but to tell my faults. )", "timestamp_created": 1497923171, "timestamp_updated": 1497923171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 95, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768758535385131836", "comment_count": 7,

These games we\u2019re all created by this studio. \n\nSo you have been warned if you spend micro-transactions in the game. Who knows, they may stop supporting this game in a few months and work on something new. This happened with [i]WarZ[/i], [i]Infestation[/i], [i]Shattered Skies[/i]. They literally abandoned the games. That\u2019s what Free Reign is known for.\n\nThe major difference between both games is that [i]Last Man Standing[/i] offers players up to $10,000 each month in online competitive tournament matches. The top-10 players each month are rewarded, and it\u2019s a way to incentivize more people to hop into the game.\n\n[h1]Release date.[/h1]\n[i]Last Man Standing[/i] is a rival created by Free Reign Entertainment against Bluehole\u2019s [i]PLAYERUNKOWN\u2019S BATTLEGROUNDS[/i]. Both games are Battle Royle-inspired games that pit multiple players against each other in survival island settings, but [i]Last Man Standing[/i] hasn\u2019t quite managed to get off to the same level of critical fanfare that [i]PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS[/i] has achieved.\n\nThe game released 6 days after [i]PLAYERUNKNOWN\u2019S BATTLEGROUNDS[/i]. Curious? I don't know.\n\n[h1]The game.[/h1]\nAs for the game itself, [i]Last Man Standing[/i] sees up to 100 players in a single instance, all vying to survive in an open-world sandbox. The last man standing is the winner of the round. There are 30 different weapons to choose from and scavenge, as well as over a dozen different weapon attachments.\n\nIn order to help players customize their look and feel, there are over 329 different customization options for characters, ranging from skins to clothing items.\n\n[h1]Gameplay.[/h1]\nFight for your live against 100 other players in the free-for-all, free-to-play Battle Royale game [i]Last Man Standing[/i]! Start off with nothing but your fists and scavenge the surrounding area for weapons and supplies, all the while dodging your opponents looking to do the same. Once you\u2019re geared up, take the fight to them and try to become the last man standing. You can kinda say it\u2019s [i]Shattered Skies[/i], but without the open world.\n\nThe shooting seems wise. Some players say it's better than [i]H1Z1[/i]; I can't prove because never played.\n\n[quote][h1]Positive points. (+)[/h1][list]\n[*]Practice server. You can enter the Battle Royale world, test the weapons, learn the map and have an infinite play time/spawn time. \n[*]Solo and Squad servers.\n[*]FPS: the FPS's depending on the area. Personally, I had good FPS's on this game when I played. Some people are complaining about it, I can run it pretty well and I don\u2019t even have a beast computer. \n[*]Competitive mode with eventual cash payouts.\n[*]Depending on a match, it can last up to 25 minutes.\n[/list][/quote]\n\n[quote][h1]Negative points. (-)[/h1][list]\n[*]You have to enter in your password every time you start the client. No option to save it or auto log-in. \n[*]Want to change FOV? You have to restart the game. This is a big mess!\n[*]The lobbies being empty: there are some complaints about a lack of players being in the game and the lobbies being empty, but others claim that the lobbies are fine. In general, while I played, players weren't lacking.\n[*]Lack of commitment from developers.\n[/list][/quote]\n\nI believe that [i]Last Man Standing[/i] has mixed reviews due to the past history of the developers, which isn't the best.

You probably need to land at least 2, and since they will star healing up the second they get hit, its hard to finish long distance targets some times\n\nIn conclusion: I still want to buy Battlegrounds some day, cuz i know for sure it is better... but till then, I will probably keep playing Last Man Standing, because overall the game its quite good in its current state, and the developers seem to care about what the comunity is asking, unlike some companies i know *cof*cof*DayBreak*cof*cof.\n\nSo yeah, PLAY IT! its fun, its fast, and even if you suck, you will look like a badass in anytime  :D\n", "timestamp_created": 1492909072, "timestamp_updated": 1492909072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 99, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.804808259010314941", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "41888625": {"recommendationid": "41888625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343237631", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503599779}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the worst games I've ever played.\nCons : \n1.Unoptimized - also bad graphics even on ultra.

The circle closes almost exactly as you would want. I don't like the idea of boosts, cause it removes the idea of a battle royale; people being equal. If you have a boost, you automatically have an advantage, making people who are new to the game, having a hard time getting close to winning. (Other than my second game I came 3rd place). In my opinion, there's a bit too many supplies. Too much ammo that anyone could handle, and way too many guns that aren't at all hard to find, but I don't really hate the idea of that, I just prefer a harder struggle to get to better supplies before someone gets you. Overall, I like the game, just wish it would make it more equal, in a sense. If I was able to change some things, I would remove boosts, give less supplies, and particularly harder recoil.

The barrier that kills you does to much damage. The map is cancer because the starting zone is directly in the middle of the map so when the last couple safe zones are there its a roll of the dice if your doing to live or die. The guns are so similar i cant tell the difference from an smg or a ar. The med kit in the game is not bad that you can heal when being shot. The sniper is extremely rare which sucks i feel it would be more fun with more snipers. The armor system is quiet annoying because it doesn't even seem to help mitigate damage at all.
