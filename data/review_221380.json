Just about all of them are bad, they have very sinister stories. In just about all of them, you are required to be an enemy of JERUSALEM, out of all things. I was absolutely shocked when I tried campaign after campaign, only to find that Jerusalem was always automatically the enemy in the levels. This is a very bad thing the AOE2 developers have done, to give you the option to do this, because Jerusalem is God's city, and the Jews are His people. \nThe only reason I'm recommending this game is because of the DLC content, and the normal skirmish mode in this game is good, you can pick whatever nation you want to be, and who your enemies or allies are.

It's not as flashy, there aren't as many features, it's not as complicated, and it doesn't look as good, but it's still fun to play. The units and their strengths and weaknesses make sense. The building system is easy to use, but I've never felt the needs for more buildings. With all the different cultures, there's endless ways to play. One further point is that this game taught little 12 year old me a big chunk of history. Thank you Age of Empires II, for the good times and the big brain moments.", "timestamp_created": 1549489449, "timestamp_updated": 1549489449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48978865": {"recommendationid": "48978865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198378464727", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550375158}, "language": "english", "review": "Old but fucking gold.\n\nUsed to play this since i was a kid, HD version is unreal, just buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1550107384, "timestamp_updated": 1550107384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48937641": {"recommendationid": "48937641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166171478", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 120, "last_played": 1551306745}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, have played this game series most of my life and love all of them.", "timestamp_created": 1549928738, "timestamp_updated": 1549928738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48861369": {"recommendationid": "48861369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198441237639", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1536200312}, "language": "english", "review": "i just need some friends :(", "timestamp_created": 1549683752, "timestamp_updated": 1549683752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48812838": {"recommendationid": "48812838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048541109", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1540391790}, "language": "english", "review": "\"chopper\"", "timestamp_created": 1549507503, "timestamp_updated": 1549507503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48909888": {"recommendationid": "48909888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082656958", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 4345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1544884868}, "language": "english", "review": "Been a fan of this game since 1998, still a fan.

Don't take you're time playing this game, (Unless you just play it on the easiest difficulty) be steady, have you're villagers work fast, recruit soldiers and upgrade you're kingdom to a more advanced economy so you can construct more building, military capabilities and etc. When you're ready, have no mercy on enemy lands or just construct a wonder, the final building that will win you the match, but you'll have to hold on as you have 300 years (like maybe 15 mins) to hold on until you win, you'll have enemy forces trying to destroy it. This game definitely requires speed, unless you decided to play extremely defensive, so build a university and start making them fortified stone walls and defence capabilities such as trebuchets, catapaults and a very big army, also upgrade youre technology while youre at it.

It was the first game I ever bought and owned for the PC. I played a lot of this game, mainly singleplayer back in 2006, but scratched the CD a couple years later. When I found it had been remastered on Steam I was quick to purchase myself a copy and have been playing both singleplayer and multiplayer since. For those of you who used to own a copy like myself, I highly advise purchasing this digital edition, as it offers both the same nostalgic gameplay and a great strategic outlet. The Forgotten DLC also gives you more to explore and adds even greater variety to an already extensive game. I highly recommend this title, as it has quickly (re)become a personal favorite.\nFor those of you who haven't played Age of Empires before, it was one of the older RTS games dating back to the late 90s / early 21st century. I'm surprised more people don't play it. You are given a wide selection of civilizations with specific perks each, and try to race each other towards an objective, be it a Wonder Race, Deathmatch, or King of the Hill. All of which are great fun! What really stands out with this game is that there are hundreds, if not thousands of ways to win. Granted, the mechanics may seem simple and outdated, but when trying to runn an entire empire with 200+ units against up to seven other players, every click counts as you try to out-maneuver, out-think, and out-micro your opponent. The graphics may take a while to get used to, but what you really should look forward to enjoying is the satisfaction of wrecking the strong defenses of an enemy with allies or alone, and conquering lands one by one.

In 5 months it'll be 20 years and people still want part 4 which most probably never come. Since the last part it's been over 10 years. Do you guys even remember that book which was released by Microsoft Studios which showed up AoE 4 and 5? I guess we all believe there was suppose to be 4/5. Wasn't it actually Bill Gates who said he'll look into that (answer for question what's up with AoE 4?)\n\n1999 was the year of original Age of Empires 2: The Age of Kings and year later expansion The Conquerors. Don't tell me it didn't affected your childhood, growing or just lifetime in general as a gamer? That game was (is) incredible. 13 years later instead of Age of Empires IV we've recieved HD remaster. It's easier to remaster something that was already done than create something new right? Times of remasters. \n\nNow, this remaster wasn't bad at all. There are several pros. Most importantly, fan base. Secondly actual game at Steam Store (no idea if there was SD edition, if so write in comment please). Another pros contains working and great multiplayer, actual HD and the fact that you can just relive it all once again. \n\nI don't even know if there's something to say about this game. It has its campaign, that contains another campaign that  contains another campaign and same with The Conquerors + respective DLC content. So if you don't feel to play Skirmish yet or Scenarios or just free build then do campaign. But Skirmish at least for me is main element why I've played this game. And of course you start with nothing, nowhere, uneducated paesant and end up kinging your own Empire that will crush your enemies like nothing.\n\nThere is just f*ckton of nations (+ DLC nations) so you have really big selection and yes every have its own bonuses. Architecture looks really great, buildings, units and everything just like good old times. Wonders are spectacular. Architecture of new DLCs is also really beautiful. (No, I'm not hard on DLC content whatsoever). Game also have various game modes such as King of the Hill, Wonder Defense, Wonder Destroying, Relic Captures, DM and lot more.\n\nIt's really hard to tell how long Age of Empires II lasts for you. It just all depends what you prefer and how long it can keep you entertained. Some can get bored in few hours, somebody is still going to enjoy it even after 500 hours. I'm on over 150 at the moment, and I must say I'm really exhausted. So do your math.\nPrice point is kinda friendly especially during sale so don't think about it twice if you like RTS games. \n\nMultiplayer can get very interesting sometimes, sometimes laggy as hell sometimes smooth as I don't know, skin of some smooth human being. However it also depends on what you like. Me personally I don't like big farming and just rushing everything, so I enjoy more playing MP with all friends in lobby so there's no serious rush. But if you like opposite then hop into that MP or SP with hard CPU and it will be your heaven. \n\nThere used to be a lot of bugs and glitches back in 2013 even with both SP and MP but everything is calm now and you can enjoy it to the max.\n\nLast thing before end I want to adress are achievements. For me personally definition of Achievement is not to keep me in game longer than I should already be. If you want to keep me in game way way way way waaaay longer when I was already suppose to be done, that's not Achievement for me. Achievement should expose every element of the game possible. Achievement should cover every existing aspect of the game or action you can done without holding you inside game for too long. So if anybody thought it would be wise to put achievements like these in Age of Empires II HD was clearly nuts. Yes it covers everything, but it fairly exceeded anything sane. \n\n[b]Bonus Point: Nostalgia of 1999[/b]\n[h1]Rating: 8.5/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1490194828, "timestamp_updated": 1490194828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 97, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.879728853702545166", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33751422": {"recommendationid": "33751422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027241844", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 23244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1537405857}, "language": "english", "review": "God created computers so that Age of Empires II could be played on them.", "timestamp_created": 1500839022, "timestamp_updated": 1500839022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 135, "votes_funny": 70, "weighted_vote_score": "0.885137081146240234", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32956362": {"recommendationid": "32956362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308306533", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546378431}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember, our family just bought our first computer, it is very hard to say, but it is the truth, that it was in the last century.\n\nOne of the first games we played was the Age of Empires 1.

I first laid eyes on the scout calvary, would ignore the shit out of everything else, because he looked cool in my eyes at 4 years of age. Since then, Ive been playing this game on and off, I'm 21 now, and I still find myself latched on to it. I now have a daughter of my own, although she won't know what it was like to see the game evolve over the course of 16 years, she will still know how it came to be, assuming she would even find it as cool as I have growing up. I think for me at least it was the growing anticipation of seeing something new with every civ, while still keeping the basics of the game simple and the same in it's own ways. I used to play this during lunch break in middle school from 2006-2009 with all of my friends, for the most part, I came out on top, even had our own little community of players, formed our own club, and we made a board game out of it. It was pretty cool that not all of us were premature nerds that played this, at least half of our little community were jocks that just loved it as much as we did, and there was no discrimination involved in any of it.  We amassed to a total of 20 or more people in this community, and for a small amount of us, our community is still strong with new members and old. This game is called Age of Empires II, and it will stand the test of time for the ages. I'm happy and delighted that people are still playing this game 16 years later, and we're still finding newcomers for this game at as faster rate than before. I've come to realize that just since early 2014 I have ended up spending hundreds of hours playing this game, teaching people both young and old what to do in this game. I'm so thrilled to see that this game is coming out with new expansions still to this day, even after 16 years. I think that if I were to find the gold edition realeased back in 2004 without the package being opened or torn, I would keep it as a collector's item, this game has so much potential and I'm happy to see that it's not being thrown away in to the trash. I honestly believe that when I die of old age, assuming that I don't die any other way, I will more than likely have a copy in my coffin for when my body gets discovered generations later, people will know what kind of influence this game had on my life as much as anyone else's life. I honestly didn't even play the Conqueror's expansion pack until 2007, even though I knew about it unpon release date, my mother refused me video games, so I never got to play it on time like most of my friends did, but I knew that I would at some point in time. Due to my parents seperation back in 2001 shortly after my mother's mother died, I ended up living with my mother, as she got the majority of custody except on holidays when I would be with my father. Whenever I was with him, he would let me play games, even though it was against my mother's wishes. I really loved playing as the Celts, Britons, Franks, Goths, and Vikings, at the time, they were my favorite. Now and again however, you will find me riding along Genghis Khan's horde as the Mongols, however, you can also find me still enjoying the company of the Goths and Britions. I love all of the civilizations very much, I know that they all have their strengths and weaknesses, some are greater than others. My best advice to you is to rush your enemies into the dirt while still keeping up with your economy via micro manage. I would rate this game a solid 10/10 and would also highly recommend it to anyone who still finds the old RTS game to be complexed and fun. I can't wait for the new expansion to come out November 5th 2015 African Kingdoms will have without a doubt in my mind as many new features as it pre successors. I hope you all have a try at this game, it's for sure my favorite game of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1444324919, "timestamp_updated": 1444324919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 407, "votes_funny": 60, "weighted_vote_score": "0.906566798686981201", "comment_count": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36959657": {"recommendationid": "36959657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042831386", "num_games_owned": 576, "num_reviews": 569, "playtime_forever": 16531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503331037}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]The review is written from single-player perspective.[/i]\n\n[h1]Short version: 81%[/h1]\nAge of Empires 2 is one of the most popular strategy games ever made, thanks to its large variety in civilisations, units, and tactics that suit many play styles.

I would still consider AoE2HD the better single-player experience for a newcomer, thanks to some of the small user interface tweaks and many of the gorgeous Workshop graphical mods.

The original game may be old, but it stood against the test of time. Most RTS games do not even have the same depth as AoE had established. \n\nHow good is it? \n\n*The game allows players to adopt all sorts of different strategies. One can build walls and castles for defense, or focus on offense and pit enemies with swarms of knights or archers. \n\n*There are multiple civilizations, ranging from the Britons to the Mayans, each with their own benefits and shortcomings. Every time a match is played, it's almost never the same thanks to the diversity. \n\n*Gameplay wise, combat isn't the only aspect that is prioritized. The in-game economy is something to consider, as most resources are not infinite. Trees eventually deplete, food sources as well, and the same goes for stone and gold deposits. The fight for control over the sparce resources can be intense. It's also worth mentioning there's a degradation rate for wild animals, where it slowly decays and can be rendered useless after a set time has passed. \n\n*AoE has a phenomenal soundtrack and goes well with the atmosphere of the game. The music starts off as calm when starting out and it gradually grows on players the more they compete in AoE. \n\n*The Workshop addition and the map editor are great additions for AoE, where anyone can download custom maps, retextures, and other related materials, and even publish them. \n\nStill, it does have flaws even for a great game. \n\n*Running on an old engine means it cannot handle that many AI units at once. Even with a decent gaming computer, I have noticed units stutter and the game can lag when there are too many units in a large map. \n\n*The Steam version lacks the option to set a video resolution and the ability to zoom in and out. \n\n\nEven then, my only regret is not playing it sooner.

It's a timeless classic that is still just as enjoyable today as the day it came out. In my opinion it is the best RTS game of all time and for that to still be true 10 years later, it is certianly worth full price.\n\nHowever, this is the HD version so it is slightly different. Graphics are practically the same - which is ok for such a timeless game. However it doesn't quite live up to it's HD title. However, I came back for the game - not for anything new.\n\nThis HD version HDifys the gameplay rather than the graphics. It adds a new map size and increases the highest pop cap to 500 - allowing for much better games if your PC can handle it. The new map size hurts the PC more than the pop cap though and I've played 500 pop games on a laptop on the old standard map size. I don't recommend doing that with more than one player though. Nonetheless, huge armies are very fun to play with and add that little thing that we probably would've modded in. However - if this is what sold you then make sure you have a decent PC for it because it gets unbearably laggy on certian systems.\n\nAnother update is the new AI which they patched in at some point. As a man who prefers to do single player, this new AI added a proper challenge to the old game when I played all the time during my childhood. I used to be able to take on  6 other AIs on the hardest difficulty all on the same team. Now I struggle against them on equal footing. However, you do have the option of playing against the original AI if you want. Even a mix if you really want. The only problem I've found with it is that it will focus on water whenever there's a significant amount of water on the map. This can be good at times but when they attempt a galley rush on highland and you walk right around them it's limitations can be quite apparent.\n\nOne big flaw is it's multiplayer. They've removed the LAN function for some reason. Despite this I still play this at LAN parties but we play through the online mode. A little bit annoying. Another thing is the lag. There's a noticable lag between when you click somthing and when it notices. This did cause problems but they are working on patching these problems out. The lag still exists but I'm no longer having the problem of me putting many houses in a line and it registering the house I accidently placed rather than the ones I wanted. However, I have played an entire game which was full of unbearable lag. However, it has multiplayer (the original's doesn't work anymore) and it actually lets you try the new civillisations from the expansion packs in it.\n\nOverall, this is still the Age of Empires 2 that I loved all my life. It didn't need updating but they gave it a go and basically refreshed the experience a bit by letting me play on larger maps and with larger populations. Still the same game and therefor worth full price in my opinion. I'd personally say that the fact that the game is still being updated and you've got expansion packs if you want more, it's somthing you should get. Even if you've never played it you should try this game as it is the best game of all time in my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1446677817, "timestamp_updated": 1446677817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 74, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.811694800853729248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23549641": {"recommendationid": "23549641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010550956", "num_games_owned": 430, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 7558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1523814126}, "language": "english", "review": "If you know what Age of Empires 2 is: get it. The HD version is a delight and they also added multiplayer support and decently-priced DLC.

Alright I\u2019ll stop.\n\nAoE2 is a RTS in which you play one of many olden civilizations, starting in the Dark Ages, and progress all the way to the Imperial Age, all while expanding, building an army, creating defences, researching military/industrial/agricultural improvements, leading your forces to battle, creating trade routes, protecting wonders, finding relics, gathering all seven Dragon Balls et cetera et cetera.\n\nThe \u201cto do\u201d list might intimidate new players, but AoE2 plays as smooth as butter, with easy controls and button layouts. After a few sessions and looking up a guide, you too will have a strong starting economy and empire in 15 minutes during skirmishes (campaign can be a different beast altogether).\n\nThe economy is based on 5 resources: food, wood, stone, gold and population (from houses). There are multiple ways to get each resource, albeit stone and wood trading is a bit difficult with the AI since this isn\u2019t really a game about diplomacy. Gold however can be taken from \u201ctrading\u201d easily among two of your marketplace buildings: the further they are, the more you get.\n\nBe prepared to spew out villagers left and right and grab any rock and log you can get, since you will need them to build an army. Besides the regular soldiers, each civ has it\u2019s own perks and a castle with a unique soldier. Some have restrictions to certain troops or upgrades, making sure each one feels and plays slightly different.\n\nAll of these can be inspected neatly in the Tech Tree, available both in and out of game. You will also find an encyclopaedia about medieval battles, units, buildings, kingdoms; all sorts of neat things that old farts like myself wish were still around in modern games. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that AoE2 HD, without any DLC, has 9 historical campaigns that are both entertaining, educational and, at times, hard as nails.\n\nIf you like \u201ceasy to learn difficult to master\u201d RTS games, absolutely get it.", "timestamp_created": 1465897988, "timestamp_updated": 1465897988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 105, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.868800103664398193", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16354225": {"recommendationid": "16354225", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093030304", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 18350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1537909457}, "language": "english", "review": "To sum it up simply, \n\nYou can spend 5 hours playing a game, thinking that you've been playing for only 30 minutes. \n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1434194911, "timestamp_updated": 1434195072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 157, "votes_funny": 70, "weighted_vote_score": "0.881883859634399414", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40947662": {"recommendationid": "40947662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121782076", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 370864, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 187, "last_played": 1550687886}, "language": "english", "review": "Awsome game!!! hours played proves this.\n", "timestamp_created": 1521587839, "timestamp_updated": 1521587839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835941076278686523", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12884247": {"recommendationid": "12884247", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969984663", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477193736}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this to death as a kid and it is exactly how I remember it.\n\nAoE2 is the quintessential medieval base builder that has you conquering your opponents through four \"Ages\", with progressively stronger and better units.

These range from tiny islands to pretty decent sized representations of European climates that have you seek out and destroy your enemies or win by several other not-so-total conquest game types. The new expansion allows those maps to be massive and adds even more civilizations to play with, making the total 23. These civilizations span from all corners of Europe, Asia and the Middle East. All units have voice clips in their native languages to help with the feel of every faction being truly different in addition to visually unique buildings and units depending on the cultural locale of your civilization.\n\nWith its migration to Steam AoE now has great multiplayer support, achievements, and Steam Workshop capabilities that will allow the sharing of user-created content to be spread much easier than having to download things like scenario  maps from a third-party webpage over dial-up as I did back in the day.\n\nIf you played this game in the past, it is well worth picking up again if nothing more than for nostalgia goggle syndrome because you know just how fun this was.

Some games are hard for me to write about in a non-biased fashion. This is one of those games. I have played so much of AOE II. Really, it is a staple of any RTS fanatics game library. I have played all of the AOE series and I have to say that this is my absolute favorite. In part, my love for this game is more about our long history together. I remember playing this game as a kid in a dark converted garage basement with my friends in an all night LAN party. I also remember playing the suprisingly informative single player campaign settings into the wee small hours of the morning. You dont have to be great at this game to still enjoy it. Even if your civ is wrecked in early game due to an unforseen rush you still have the pleasure of watching your friends kick the crap out of each other with elephants and huskarls. Endless entertainment! The strategy of this game is non-stop fun and in my opinion better than other RTS games. It is resource management, geographical awareness, and military might all rolled into a neatly designed package. Each race is unique and has its advantages and disadvantages compared to each opponent. I have spent days of my life thinking of nothing but how to use the Chinese to develop an impenetrable fortress, trying to find space for the food required for my Persian elephants, and how to make the Koreans effective in any way possible. Excluding the developments from Bethesda, I can safely say I have not played any other game as much as I have played this one. The replayability of this game is unmatched, and you can tell that the masses have supported this theory as the developers are continuing to release updates packs for this game to this day. This game is old and simple but the mechanics are sound and need no augmentation. It never has, and that is the brilliance of this game. It was good then, It is good now. \n\nNow sure we could compare this game to other stout RTS games like Starcraft and C&C, or we could even compare it to its contemporaries like Dune. It can be the competetive game like Starcraft is, but thats not the point of AOE. It is a game for friends. I, like 99% of gamers, am not about competing on center stage. I just want to have a good time with my mates. This game has always delivered on that front. There are so many games like it, but they just dont intrigue me in the same way. Again I am biased, but this game defines a part of gaming for me. Its got a spirit to it that i just cant get enough of. The map generator is a blast, the game types require different strategies, the tech trees are catered to each civilization. There is simply nothing more to ask for. It is near perfection. If you dont have it, buy it. Buy it now! Get the DLC now! Get your friends to buy it! Play it! Request more wood! Request more gold! Build a navy!

You will have hours of entertainment. This is a true classic. One of the best games of all time.[/b]\n\nThis is game is an historical classic.  One only needs to know the historical game's history to know that this is a fact. \n\nThis game is  two decades old and has an active growing community of players. The original game was released in an era when RTS were frequently anticipated AAA titles, this is one of the only games from that era which has truely stood the test of time. It has seen success over its rivals, predacessor, successors and is one of the only true contenders (along with starcraft) for the greatest rts of all time. So what  makes this game so good?\n\nAge of Empires 2 is a game that is simple goal and easy to understand mechanics, many layers of complexity. This makes it a fun game for a wide variety of skill levels. At the simplest level you have a city building RTS where you expand your town and destroy your opponents. This is a common game format, but age of empires 2 really perfected it. The game features a great set of single player campaigns which you follow the tales of historical figures such as Ghengis Kahn, Atilla the Hun, Jean De Arc etc. \n\nThe game also features a mutliplayer which rewards players of all skill levels.

Or, if you're new to the scene, want an RTS which balances the build-up of an empire with decent-paced games (and you can stomach how old it is)\n\nA fine example of a remaster done well! If you have the burning taste of nostalgia for Age of Empires - this is easily the best version to go for.\n\nIt's a clean upgrade of the original game and its expansion, Age of Conquerors - bringing in very welcome improvements: Sharper graphics, smoother movement, stronger AI... all whilst leaving the fundamental nuts and bolts very much alone and un-fudged with. There's no attempt to 'reimagine' here, it's exactly what you loved, only better. (Well... except the new fire, but there's a mod for that). There are also balance changes; but these have, thankfully, been honed over thousands of hours of top, competitive play... so are not the result of horrifyingly whimsical \"hey, I think Teutonic knights are too slow.... You know what they need? Bazookas\".\n\nFor a veteran who wants to see life breathed into one of their favourite titles - this one should tick the box nicely!\n\n\nNow... if you're [i]new[/i] to the series, this is where it gets a little tricky. The game will undoubtedly feel dated to the likes Total War, Dawn of War or Battle for Middle Earth. So a few things to bring your attention to when pondering this game:\n[list]\n    [*]The graphics remain sprite-based like the original. So there's no 3D camera or zooming here.\n    [*]No squads, so it's all about individual units. This may make battles feel a bit smaller or fiddly if you're used to bigger titles (but don't worry - hotkeys and controls groups are a thing)\n    [*]The factions all draw from the same, fundamental tech tree (with the exception of their unique unit). Their difference is in which techs they have available and their faction bonuses.\n    [*]Economy (and your builder units) plays a [i]huge[/i] role here. It's as much about balancing your economy, protecting your villagers and securing resources as it is about combat and smashing things with trebuchets.\n[/list]\n\nIts strength though is, to me, its balance. You have decent-scale base-building, resources to harvest, scouting, harassing and all-out combat. The progression is paced brilliantly so that the defender starts with the biggest advantage but, over the 4 ages (akin to 'tiers'), the balance swings more in favour of the aggressor - providing a nice build-up in games that can last anywhere from 40 minutes to a few hours (in general). I find the larger focus on economy makes for a refreshing strategic change, especially in late game where it opens up more opportunities for thwarting your opponents with your medieval shenanigans. The trade-off is that you do not necessarily get epic clashes of armies, but more ongoing skirmishes.\n\nFor me, it's fundamentally the enjoyable balance of economy and military. You get the fun base-building and build-up of an empire, married with a decent pace of play... Kinda like a pocket-Total War, if you will (albeit with considerably fewer units). Empires in a 2 hour slot.

Have 800+ hours put into it, but I'm still terrible. Lots of strategy and practice needs to be put in for this game. Each unit and building have their own upgrades, advantages, and disadvantages. The graphics are decent for a game where you watch little people running around for an hour and a half. People online are (mostly) super friendly and creating your own server for others is an easy process. The strategy is easy to understand, but extremely difficult to master in my afformentioned 800+ hours, but that's really why I love this game so much. Each tiny conquest, kill, or overall victory feels as if you had just conquered the world, but every failure just makes you want to try harder with each new game: Unlike other strategy games that are clearly filled with imbalanced characters that make you want to throw your computer out of a two-story window.

Now age of empires is not a bad game but it is deffiently not for everyone. Now lets dive into this review here.\n\nSingle player campaign\n\nSay you dont have internet or maybe you just dont want to play online well there is a variety of levels in the single player campaign for you to enjoy from the french all the way to the aztecs the campaign is packed with hours of fun filled levels each having there own story its also a good place to start if you are new to the game its slow paced and gives you a taste of what the game is like and how it will handle\n\nartificial intelligence\n\nalthough they did update this to make it feel more like your verusing an online player it ovbiously still lacks what online players have wich is diffrent strategys and diffrent skill levels the AI in this game isnt the best and is flawed but i guess you have to make do with what you have. atleast i can say its better practice then the old AI that wouldint even get the last blacksmith upgrades in the imperial age making them a joke and very easyy to deal with. so i say if your going to do any sort of deathmatch or random map or scenario for the matter you should stick to playing with real people.\n\nScenario Editor\n\nThis is my personal favorite of the game are you tired of online dont feel like playing aginst the crappy AI then why not make your own adventure or your own story in the scenario editor. i have had hours of countless fun making simple levels that i enjoy by myself to complex levels that are still in development this is deffiently one of the best features on Age Of Empires 2 just buying the game for this is worth it very user friendly, easy to usr and organized. the triggers take some practice to get use to but you will soon learn fast. the best part is that you can share your levels with the public and many other players can play them.\n\nmultiplayer\n\nThis is where the main core of the problem is for the game multiplayer is very unstable very laggy and the community isnt to nice but its not the worst you still will find alot of decent player but ocassionaly run into the ones that always try to out do everyone or put other down. if you have much patience then you may be able to handle the lag but some game lag can just be unbarable. Dont even get me started on the dysync if there on accedent or on purpose they really know how to piss you off, The worst type is the player that does it intentionally because he or she is a sore loser or doesint want to lose ELO(the points that show your ranking in the game.\n\nCivalizations\n\nThe game age of empires has a vast amount of civilizations to chose from in the game this maxumizes gameplay allowing you to tamper and play around with diffrent strategys for diffrent empires. maybe you like the ranged gunpowder of the turks or the close quarters combat of the aztecs. or maybe you like to ride the fearsome paladins of the franks into battle who knows there are many diffrent strats and builds you can try.\n\nAge Of Empires 2 Overall\n\nAge of empires is a very fun game if you can get past the  bad multiplayer lag although occasionally you come across some good lobbies that wont lag near as bad. even without multiplayer or if your preffer to play offline this game offers so much content that it takes a very long time to get bored if you chose to spend your money on the game even with its flawess i would say you would be makking a wise choice for 20 dollars i dont think you can go wrong.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1441748497, "timestamp_updated": 1441748497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.718650102615356445", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48464932": {"recommendationid": "48464932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159185611", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 153, "last_played": 1550978886}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Wood please[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1548093352, "timestamp_updated": 1548093352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 35, "weighted_vote_score": "0.75495445728302002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15938429": {"recommendationid": "15938429", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020895075", "num_games_owned": 2654, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 61163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511885939}, "language": "english", "review": "[b] Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in[/b] \n[i]AOE gamer through the years...[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1432290266, "timestamp_updated": 1432748242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 411, "votes_funny": 266, "weighted_vote_score": "0.855790019035339355", "comment_count": 27, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26356247": {"recommendationid": "26356247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157431199", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497859876}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all, thanks to my friend Augo, who gifted me this game.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis game is, truly, a masterpiece. If you liked Starcraft, you will love this game. What's the objective of this game? Winning. How? Well, make an empire. Defeat other players. Be the best one.\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nWell, what can you expect from a 99s game? Nothing but trash (compared to new AAA games), right? Well, this remake has made the graphics lovely. They changed a little bit and now, you can play the game at 1080p.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nThis is the very best thing of the game. The gameplay is exciting, fast, and makes you want to keep on playing. I just have 5 hours, but Augo gifted me this game 1 day ago (31/10/16).\n\nSTORY:\n\nThis game has a few campaigns to complete. Since I started playing on normal singleplayer, the tutorial itself it's a campaign about how the Scottish rebeled against  Edward Longshanks.\n\nSOUND:\n\nThis game has a very beautiful soundtrack, but it's quiet repetitive after hearing it everytime.\n\nOTHERS:\n\nThis is a very good example of remake. The bad thing is that the new AI is very strong. They can make a great empire in a matter of minutes.\nVery replayable game. It has trading cards, Steam Workshop, map editor and even multiplayer.\nThis is, definitely, a classic. \n\nWhy are you reading this? GO BUY IT! :D\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you REALLY readed all of my review, thanks so much.

I didn't expect this game to run completely smooth especially in multiplayer but the fact that most games do go on until the end is what makes this great. \n\n[b]One thing you must remember when playing multiplayer either with friends or other people is to make sure everybody has an okay Internet connection. Just one player with bad connection can ruin a game and possibly making it go out of sync. When playing a match if you host it or joining one, game speed will make a huge difference on how much time you will spend playing a game so you need to know how to budget your time if your planning to play a game.[/b]\n\nHere's a a single example on how this game was pushed to its limits on multiplayer and the game didn't crash or disconnect (desync) even to me.

Basically it was me on a 2 vs. 4 HARDEST AI in this game. The battle went on for about 4 hours and 3 minutes, the games timer said about 6 hours because the game speed was set differently. In short, the AI was tough but me and another player emerged victorious. This battle also was dated on the game version dated December 18th to December 19th, 2016. Make sure to jump ahead to 3:59:00 to watch the beginning of this long match.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtuuWAFbRjs\n\nI'm not an expert on strategy games so I won't go into great lengths about this game but what I can tell you is that it is fairly easy to grasp and a bit difficult to master just like Rocket League. Only way to get better is to play over and over and refining your techniques in order to build your mighty army. This game has support of the Steam workshop so you can modify this game to make it look however you like and that's a good thing for people that are used to seeing good visuals on modern games.\n\nI can't say much on the sound since the original soundtrack, banter and death sounds are still present here however you can get variety by getting new material on the Steam Workshop if you wish to.\n\nOverall, if you are sort of interested in strategy game or you love this type of gameplay then feel free to get this game. I recommend to wait until it's on sale though.\n\n[b]7.5/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1482080359, "timestamp_updated": 1483805313, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.786605715751647949", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15347283": {"recommendationid": "15347283", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998277957", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 73530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 546, "last_played": 1551811503}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a masterpiece for the Rts genre", "timestamp_created": 1428985875, "timestamp_updated": 1428985875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662735819816589355", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37291910": {"recommendationid": "37291910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042546726", "num_games_owned": 1028, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 50601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547970972}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably the best age of empires game (In my opinion)\n- Always good to come back to an old classic,\n- Wide range of Civs to play and game mode options\n- Only real down side to this game is that the mutiplayer is extremly laggy even with a good pc, fps shits it's self when you do a 8 man/bots, May not help that i like the pop at 500 but what can you do :')", "timestamp_created": 1511513648, "timestamp_updated": 1542868453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.708370625972747803", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33175114": {"recommendationid": "33175114", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001570535", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506616641}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is still one of the best strategy games around.

It came to me in demo form from my older brother, the demo disk had this, homeworld 1, some online game which i never played cos my computer was never connected to the internet, and a hoverboard racing game. All demos. Oh boy, the amount of times i played the William Wallace campaign, i even used to just stare at the cool looking Paladins in the scenario editor screen. Time passed, tried Homeworld and that one hoverboard games demos. Eventually somehow got Age of Empires 1, cant remember how, but i do remember playing the hell out of it.\n\nYears passed, was homeschooled and had to keep moving, so i didnt really have much in the way of friends, but at the age of 7 or 8 my older brother got Age of Empires 2 and the Expansion pack, letting me install it and use it.\n\nI played that, and pretty much only that for... well atleast till i was 11, i had memorized all the nations, the stats of most of the units, and had fought hundreds of single player skirmish games (rarely had internet, and when i did i wasnt allowed to waste the small amount of data we had on online games), fought every faction, played every faction, tried every stratagy i could dream of.\n\nThen i got a PS2 for my birthday and half a dozen games for it. Still played AOE on and off, but not nearly as much as i used to.\n\nCouple years passed, found my old disk, and started playing again on and off.\nThe next year i got a new laptop for christmas, one that didnt overheat every half an hour when playing 3d games.\nEven then i still played.\n\n4-5 years passed and here i am, thousands of hours under my belt but i still play, and find it as challenging and fun as ever, hell, even recently got into Multiplayer.\n\n\nNow, personal nostalgia aside, this next section is if you should get THIS version of AOE 2, there being other HD refits of this particular game. Voobly for instance has one which i hear is reasonably good (havent tried it myself).\n\nThe thing about this particular version is that it updates, but the devs arent exactly... competent enough that each update doesnt break something or other. Hell, for years this has been a buggy, laggy mess from what i have heard, having only got this last year. Recently it has reached some form of functionality, your PC wont catch on fire if you try to use the higher pop limits or the new map size, and multiplayer now works mostly as intended.\n\nThe DLC's... well, they have their own review sections.\n\nOverall, not a whole lot has changed to the base game, new map size, HD resolutions (dont try in 4k, it doesnt work too well) better AI and some rebalances.\n\n\nAnd for the new player i think i will write a seperate guide and link it, as explaining everything about this game would turn this into a massive text wall...\n\n\nIn conclusion, i think the devs of this HD edition could have done a better job overall, i personally hope someone will pick this game or the Genie Engine (what this game is built on) and build a new game with some more features, deformable terrain for instance would allow for more sources of gold and stone lategame and allow for artificial moats.\n\nSo yeah, i do recommend this game, weather or not you get this particular iteration is up to you.\n\nA true 10/10 game, 6/10 devs.", "timestamp_created": 1484299796, "timestamp_updated": 1484299806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.69038999080657959", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17636001": {"recommendationid": "17636001", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060133892", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 5774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493518511}, "language": "english", "review": "you can sink ships by converting them to christianity 10/10 just like i remember it", "timestamp_created": 1440110007, "timestamp_updated": 1440110007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 467, "votes_funny": 1007, "weighted_vote_score": "0.830698132514953613", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33372619": {"recommendationid": "33372619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047363703", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 91706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 678, "last_played": 1551565329}, "language": "english", "review": "START THE GAME ALREADY", "timestamp_created": 1499516655, "timestamp_updated": 1499516655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.69119638204574585", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14138419": {"recommendationid": "14138419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005516424", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449912591}, "language": "english", "review": "hit a stone castle with swords\nit catches on fire\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1422081583, "timestamp_updated": 1422081583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 108, "votes_funny": 344, "weighted_vote_score": "0.811034500598907471", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37848999": {"recommendationid": "37848999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328029116", "num_games_owned": 1121, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1528677982}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a musthave.

It is a perfected version of Age of Empire II: The Age of King and Age of Empire II: The Conquerors expansion pack reimagined in HD and now entirely as one single game. Everybody know what Age of Empire is unless you're really new to PC gaming, the game is a legend, was the best classic real-time strategy of that time.\n\nAll gameplay and features in this game is left untouched and are very exactly the same as the old Age of Empire II except for the new 500 population limit for skirmish play, let's you train even more units and having a larger battles and larger tactics than before.\n\nThe graphics has been improved slightly where you can see the new water and fire textures and effects are better than before. The new widescreen support for the game are also included. The rest still retain the same graphics as before.\n\nWell, the exact same gameplay and features could be the good or bad thing, because most people don't like buying things similar with what they already have, own or taste, but if you're looking for the old Age of Empires II in a new and better way then it is for you. All the story campaign, civilization is all there and the new Steam workshop integration is the best thing so you now can download many user created content ranging from maps, scenarios, AI scripts and many more to customize your game or create your own stuff and share it with everyone in the Steam community.

I recently had an online 3v3 match where I had to fight the Japanese, British, and the Spanish. Early on, my friend got attacked by the Spanish which left his empire severely crippled. He sent some villagers to settle next to my empire so we could attack together. Around the beginning of the second hour, we kept getting attacked by the Japanese, so we assembled large armies to push through. Soon enough, my navy and our armies destroyed the Japanese. We both settled in the area because the Japanese left a lot of resources around. Resources were scarce around midgame, so we set up small strike forces to chip away at the British empire. Soon enough, we lead an ambush on the British, attacking their buildings and razing their farmlands. We killed their army and destroyed their most important buildings, eventually causing them to surrender. Our last enemy were the Spanish. Led by Queen Isabella, she had armies of monks and conquistadors. We kept getting our asses destroyed by her forces, almost leading us to surrender. She had controlled most of the land, which would prove to be a challenge to us. It took us about 2 hours to destroy her navy and kill her conquistadors and monks. Soon enough, she surrendered, as we just toppled the largest empire on the continent and brought it to its knees.
