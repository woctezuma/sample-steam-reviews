Normal, bhop, surf, zriot, ze, zm, hideandseek, mg, hoejus,, fy, gungame, scoutsknives, awpknives etc. - which were all community made including the maps, with NO EXTRA COST! Just head on into the server browser, and enjoy.\n\nNext, let's talk about how the community is far from toxic. If we look at CSGO currently (whether it's casual or competitive, at whatever ranking stage) - there is always one who wants to be billy big b0ll0cks and talk smack to everyone else, or be loud, grief etc etc. In this, there are still... Wait for it...\n\nDEDICATED SERVERS! Admins can mute, kill, kick and ban this minority, leaving you to get on with the fun.\n\nIf you're not one of these people who want to play the many different game modes offered in this, and still want good, olf-fashioned hostage or bomb Counter Strike, not to worry - it's still there! Only you don't have to pay monthly or sign up to a website to have the option to play 128 tick servers - that's the norm for this game *cough* 64tick CSGO *cough*\n\nOverall, I have had MANY hours of entertainment (and still do), I've met many friends whom are now very close and even travelled to different countries to meet them, and I do, have, and always will recommend this Counter Strike to absolutely anybody. \n\nThanks for reading!

The recoil makes it feel like there's a punch behind (almost) every bullet that hits, and, while the game's age is certainly showing, the freedom it gives the experienced player is in my humblest of opinions unrivalled.\nThe fast pacing, the short rounds, the sheer amount of game modes and ways of playing the same game makes it thoroughly enjoyable.

This game is well-polished, it did have bugs and glitches back then but it's gone after several updates. Even playing with just bots is fun to play (especially putting them on the highest difficulty. Aimbot and all).\n\nI still remember those early times of CS:S where you can't choose a \"soldier/mercenary\" to use, like just getting into the game with the same \"outfit\", which is the Phoenix and I think the ST6 (if I'm not mistaken). Also, this game had a shield once. It was fun to use but it was removed from the game.\n\nWell, this game might last for decades, I hope. Overall, it's a GREAT game. I can't even like make a minimalistic or a wide review for this game since it's just that good and memorable. Definitely will be played for years.\n\nNOTE: Yes, currently I have few hours of this game but I actually played the \"cracked/pirated\" version of it when I was 7, so if I add up all the hours back then and sum it all up with my current hours. I probably have a thousand hours (or almost) of game time (including offline times).\n\nIf I have wrong grammars and comprehensions or any reactions, feel free to comment on my review.

but didn't like it that much mostly because everyone was still playing 1.6.Which was at that time at least in my country, at the peak of its glory.Neverless all of that, this game still holds a special place in my heart.Playing many surf maps,zombie maps,deathruns with friends and many more.The body physics were the biggest attraction to CS:S for me.Source's graphics at that time were insane and people were surprised with it.Compared to CS:GO today it's very underrated but what can you do,people change through the years and so does their taste.As I said Source holds a very special place because of many memories I have of it.It already has enough reviews but this one is written purely for respect for this game.Thanks for the memories Valve.\nFinal verdict 10/10 - Extremely
