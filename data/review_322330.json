They were wrong. That's the point of DST!\n\nThis game will frustrate you to no end. You'll love every minute of it, except for the last minute when you get wiped out. Or that minute your base is on fire and theres nothing you can do about it. Or that minute you are 10 screens from home without fuel for a fire because you're an idiot and left it at home. Or that minute you can see a berry bush in sight but then keel over from starvation. Or that minute a giant bear shows up and smashes everything that took you 5 hours to build. But you'll love all the other ones. Probably.\n\nThe game has a high risk/high reward play style. first Severeal times will be a confusion fest as there is no tutorial and you learn to survive through failure to do so. Every death teaches you what you might want to try differently next time. \n\nYou'll be constantly stressed out on the default mode trying to prepare everything you need to survive your first summer/winter. And it feels epic when you do! Every time. In order to do it, though, you need to take some risks you're rarely totally prepared for: Kill a spider hive, attack some bees, hunt for those elusive gears you need to build that dang refrigerator. Do you hunt for food or gather wood you need to fuel a fire for days? Strategy depends entirely on the procedural randomized world and how you choose to create a strategy around what you find as you explore it. And your team's cohesion in executing it.\n\nYou can tweak the settings of the game world to make it as easy or as grueling as you want it to be. You can spend most of a game season preparing your base to survive winter only to have a lightning bolt or giant bear monster undo all your work in a horrible night. It's a rouge-like really so once everyone is dead; it's game over. It's painful to watch something you've invested in turn to dust! But that is what makes the game so rewarding and every minute so meaningful: is the knowledge that at any point a mistake could cost you the game. And when you make it day 300 it feels like you've earned it!\n\n10/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1550136128, "timestamp_updated": 1550136128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49092518": {"recommendationid": "49092518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159339378", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "last_played": 1550718065}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1550538297, "timestamp_updated": 1550538297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49109304": {"recommendationid": "49109304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240558232", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1526314668}, "language": "english", "review": "Artstyle simply amazing, but it has some problems, the main one, being the lack of a main objective to do (as the game tells you, its to don't starve, aka remain alive, but it doesnt feel ok), also the game doesn't teach you well all it's mechanics, so if you really want to learn to play the game to have fun, you gotta use outside resourses. Also feels really grindy and a little rng dependent on spawns, idk if the feeling goes away when you git gud at the game, but I didn't stay for long to know that.

Sorry for this inconvience.\n\n\n\nWhen I first got my key, I got really exicted, To the point where I've gotten over 400+ Days on a world w/ my friends. Here are some of the basic things you should keep in mind about while playing with your friends.\n\nStarting off:\nOnce you start off you have 3 choices or gamemodes to play with your friends, Survival, Wilderness and Endless\n\nSurvival: Basically same twist as if you payed endless just if everyone on the server is Dead, a counter goes down for someone to join (That is alive) or the whole world gets reset with the same generation presets.\n\nWilderness:  When you join the server you spawn in a random location (Sometimes an island if your unlucky) and you need to find your group to set up camp. Once you die or have died you are taken to the change character screen and respawn in a new location with your camera rotated in a different pos and if you look on your map there will be a small circle on where you've last died. Keep in mind you die again that Circle updates to where you last died so try to get back to your stuff without dying.\n\nEndless: Ah, my favorite of all the gamemodes. When you join the server you spawn in from a \"Jury-Rigged Portal\" And begin surviving. If you die you become a ghost with the character traits of your character. You can respawn if you haunt one of the following. (Meat Effigy, Life giving amulet, Touch stone, Jury rigged portal and Tale-Tell heart) If you respawn from the \"Jury-Rigged Portal or Tale-Tell heart\" You will lose around 20 MAX Health Points. You can get those lost hit points back from getting a booster shot which requires 3 Papyrus, 2 Healing Salves and 1 Stinger (YES STINGERS FINALLY HAVE A USE)\n\nOnce you join the server (Depending on the size / max amount of players) You basically play regular Don't Starve, If join a larger server with more people there's a silm chance that you will be able to survive the up coming winter or Night. Which can be difficult depending if PVP is on or not. And Since armor has now been changed to take Less damage i.e Wood Armor = 80% (Reg ds) 60% (Dst) Marble = 95% (Reg Ds) 80% (Dst) Football helm = 80% (Reg dst) 60% (Dst).\n\nCharacters -\n\nWilson:\n\nPros -\n\nGrows a beard\n\nCons - None.\n\nWilson is a character that i'm pretty sure everyone is going to see ALOT of since he's the first character and Really has no Downfalls even though it takes 19 days for Wilson to get his Homeless man beard it will protect you in winter.\n\nWillow:\n\nPros -\n\nDoesn't Take fire damage\nStarts with a lighter (Infinte torch)\n\nCons -\n\nWhen on low sanity Will cause lots of forest fires\nCan Grief other players Flamable walls / Crops.\n\nWillow is a good character for surviving the Winter and helping out your friends in DST. But she can be used to be the most annoying person in the entire server. She can run around starting massive forest fires and buring down vauable resources as well as causing LOTS of lag.\n\nWolfgang:\n\nPros -\n\nGets stronger on a full stomach\nHas more hp\n\nCons - \n\n1.5x the faster Hunger drain at full stomach\nMoves and deals less damage at a smaller stomach\nLoses more sanity in Night / Afternoon\n\nAh, Wolfgang more of a fighter than a gardener. Wolfgang can be useful for tanking spiders nest and killing of those annoying Tall birds and getting there eggs the only downfall is If you have a lot of food toghether It's not going to last very long amongest 6 Players, If you are playing as wolf gang only \"Power up\" to full stomach when in need. Don't just waste food to be a full stomache because food WILL be eaten fast.\n\nWendy:\n\nPros -\n\nHas a ghost sister\nDoesn't lose much sanity in dark\n\nCons -\n\nDoes -.25% Less damage than all characters\nLoses 50 Sanity when spawning abigail in\n\nWendy is one of my personal favorite characters just to add a little challange to the game. Even though she doesn't hit hard she losses NO Sanity in the Afternoon. As well she can spawn her sister in after 2 - 4 Days by killing ANY Animal / Creature Near the flower. She will lose 50 sanity for spawning he in even if another player kills something near the flower. But the fun part is Abigail does Splash damage to mobs near her. If you need to fight something send abigail (or your friends) to kill it. If abilgail dies go pick her flower up, If you can't find it theres a minimap icon for it.\n\nWX78:\n\nPros - \n\nCan eat ANY Food that is spoiled /  Stale and take no penalty.\nCan be charged by lightning\nCan eat gears to level up (Max 400 hp, 200 Hunger, 300 Sanity) Also gears give health, hunger and sanity back if eaten.\n\nCons -\n\nTakes Damage in the rain\nStarts with low stats (100 hp, 100 hunger, 100 Sanity)\n\nWX78 Is a good character if you can get to a supply of gears fast as well your going to need to hunt down a pig village for an umbrella. If you don't get an umbrealla right off the bat you will loss 0.25 of 1 Hp every 3 - 5 Seconds. If your lucky enough and you make an umbrealla you won't have the chance of being struck by lightning which will cause you too lose 33 Sanity but Not freeze during winter and can glow like a torch the effect only lasts for one day so don't be adventuring in the middle of the night if the Radius of light is shrinking. But can be benifical if you use if effectively.\n\nWickerbottom:\n\nPro -\n\nStarts off with all science machine reciepes unlocked.\nAble to craft her own books\nStarts off with 2 Papyrus.\n\nCons -\n\nCan't Sleep\nTakes more penalty for eating Spoiled or Stale food\n\nWickerbottom, The walking science machine, You can pretty much help your friends by going right to an achlemy engine instead of wasting the time of making an Science machine. Even though you can't Sleep there are multiple ways of getting your sanity back up. With the abiliy to make your own books  you have the power to instantly grow all crows and Plants, Spawn lots of birds and more for the cost of your sanity. And yes I know this sounds like wickerbottom is a bad character, as long as you know how to get sanity back without murdering the flower population.\n\nThe Rest of the characters have no been added while writing this review.\n\nOver all this is a great game and I recommend it to any and all players.\n\nEDIT: YOU DON'T NEED DON'T STARVE TO PLAY THIS YOU JUST NEED A DON'T STARVE TOGHETHER KEY.

Well, it worked out brilliantly. \n  Don't Starve Together is entirely based on team cooperation and surviving through the hardest of obsticles to reach a level of satisfaction when you come back to your own base, where it feels like home, because of all the effort you have put.

Rather, I thought, 'What a cute fuzzy animal.' I never thought to kill this giant, mellow beast because I was sure that behind those peaceful, lamenting eyes was fury and pain if I were to ever anger this beast. So, I decided to set up a base close enough to gather its wool, but far away enough so it would not wander into my base at nightfall.\n\nThe autumn days whisked by, and I was starving. Low on food, I decided to try to do something to fix my food woes; steal a tallbird's egg. As a new player, this was the worst thing I could have done.\n\nIt pecked me viciously, dealing huge damage to me. I ran back to my base, where it stopped chasing me and went back to the nest. I was dangerously low on health.\n\nThen, I heard Wilson speak.\n\n'Did you hear that?\"\n\nYes, I did, in fact, started hearing those hounds bark. I knew it all to well, for those hound attacks have ended my previous runs twice now.\n\nIn an effort to save myself, I ran to the beefalo, hoping they would provide protection from these cruel beasts. \n\nThe hounds came swift, one by one, as they chased me through the savannah. Soon, they started attacking the beefalo herd, and the beefalos quickly dealt with each hound one by one, and all the hounds died thereafter.\n\nI vowed to myself that I would remember this. These beefalo saved my life. I would never try to harm a beefalo for the rest of my days.\n\nWinter came. Luckily, from shaving those beefalo and decimating that spider nest back in the forest of graveyards, I was set to survive. Until the midwinter night came.\n\nMoans from a creature I have never heard of before. I was prepared this time for any attack, I thought. I had created a few log suits, and a spear to deal with these attacks. What I was not prepared for was a giant deer with one eye to pop out from the night and proceeded to destroy my base.\n\nI thought to myself, holy crap, I am done for. Then I realized. I have my beefalo!\n\nI was stupid.\n\nI tricked the Deerclops into attack the herd, and the herd came back to strike him. Then, I realized the entire herd froze over.\n\nWhat I was not prepared for, was the AOE destruction that the Deerclops has.\n\nThinking to myself, I can't let these beefalo die! These things have protected me through thick and thin!\n\nRunning to save the beefalo herd being pounded, I speared him, and took 15 damage. And another 15. And another 15.\n\nMy log suits quickly wore out, and soon, I was left with nothing but my winter hat. Still, I fought on, until it struck me with one final blow for 75, and I died, along with the beefalo herd that I promised I would protect. I was sad, that my run would end trying to protect these beefalo with my life.\n\nThat was my fourth run, back when I started up this game in 2013. I've played through hundreds of worlds since then, trying to go further. From killing Dragonfly, to trying to delve into the Ruins. And every time I died, I was frustrated, and I even quit a few times, but in the end, I would make a new world and begin again. \n\nNot out of a sense of 'I should try to survive longer' but in the sense of, 'There's still so much I haven't experienced.'\n\nThe 'Don't Starve' artstyle, the gameplay, its lore, everything about it charmed me.

Cons\nthe game goes a bit too fast sometimes. what sould have taken around 100 days turns into something you do in the first month. aswell, food (although still a problem) is nearly non-existant when you have someone that gathers rabbits and berries in the morning. this goes for health aswell, as bees seem to be someone's top priority. if you are not dumb, or take something on too tough for you, you will never die. (unless you are WX because rain is so BS)\n\n4.) end result\nthe game is well balanced and fun. there is a dynamic knowledge of what we need to do. you can eventually get to a point where you have \"morning routines\" like gathering the rabbits from the field, and harvesting honey, without the worry of needing to spend your ENTIRE day doing that, like you do in singleplayer. the game move much faster, and the ability to respawn (if you have nice teammates) makes it much more enjoyable, with the fear of permideath always on your shoulder. i would reccomend this game to those that did not enjoy the super-stress of the singleplayer, but likes the overall gameplay, or just because they want to play with friends. this, however, is a short burning flame. the game does not last long, as server hosts need to leave, ending the game for everyone. in the end, however, i give it a good review. it is great gameplay with a slight gameplay twist, that ends up turning it into what seems as an entirely new game by the devs. 8/10; brb going to go play it again.", "timestamp_created": 1419099064, "timestamp_updated": 1419099064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 97, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.861600220203399658", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23241011": {"recommendationid": "23241011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062526269", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 22086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548368774}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros\n*Exceedingly high replayability*\n*Fun Tim Burton-esque art*\n*Multiplayer for suffering in groups*\n*Random generation*\n*likeable and unique character options*\n*Fantastic mod support*\n*Cosmetic character items given for playing.*\n*Many functional strategies for survival based on your playstyle and preference*\n*Difficult*\n\nCons\n*Ever so slight delay between what you see and what is happening.

We read reviews, compare walkthrough videos, look for replayability value. Curators, Steam sales, Humble Bundle - it all paints a rather complex picture of what we do before making our mind.\n\nAnd sometimes, games choose us. \n\nI have never been a person favouring survival games. I have never touched multiplayer before. My approach to games is that of a narratologist: I see them as stories. Thus, I am naturally better-disposed towards examples rich in narrative, possibly less flexibility in shaping the plot, but a fully-fleshed character and loving mythopoeia. I do not need other people to enjoy the action of a BioWare RPG or the king of first person sneakers like Thief. These are as wonderful on their own.\n\nI received DST as a gift from my friend. With no practical experience in multiplayer games, I took the plunge due to her own magnificent person. And on the colourful crusade against death of bees and pengulls (my typical bane at the time), I caught the bug going by the game's name. Beginning to host myself, with the ability to create more hostile maps through the careful use of prefab presets and lore-friendly mods, then starting a group to coordinate our sessions and joining the Klei forums came naturally, with little to no realisation on my side. And finally, with a group of similarly-minded regulars in love with the written word, we took our TDE wilderness adventure into the game for the added challenge of survival while storytelling. \n\nOn the doorstep of my first anniversary of setting foot outside the familiar glowing portal, I am honoured to highlight the impressive replay value of DST. With plenty of detailed reviews dealing with the intricacies of the game, I would rather focus on the bigger picture. DST is one of the rare games growing with you. You start as a rather hapless freshman in a world of wacky science, grim-sweet humour and dangers galore. You learn the importance of bearing a light as darkness approaches, remembering your fragile sanity and crafting items whose recipes are often amusingly bereft of sense (whoever thought wearing a fantasy elephant's trunk as a vest would be a good idea, I applaud you). Topmost, you die. Often. In very endearing ways. But you (hopefully) learn from your mistakes and with time find yourself successfully facing the most daunting of threats. \n\nAt some point, you feel you have beaten the game. You have at least one big camp spreading across the horizon, parade in thulecite gear and fry giants with magical staves. But this is the point where it is all starting: you seek new ways to challenge yourself. You tinker with worldgen options (\"Let's set hound mounds to lots!\"). You browse the workshop for mods (where Sturgeon's Law is as accurate as ever, yet still worth the risk for the elusive 10% of gems). You try out new characters, new strategies, new maps. You come up with your own challenges beyond Lights Out. You are prone to becoming the member of the community whose lair is the forums and secular cult: the hallowed Potato Cup. Maybe you actually start GM-ing a wilderness adventure to expand the elegantly unobtrusive plot.\n\nFinally, you likely realise the human aspect of Don't Starve [i]Together[/i] in comparison to the impressive singleplayer. It is more fun, more engaging, more threatening, even, to die in company. Which, naturally, is many-faced, since the people you meet on public servers are as likely to make a griefer coming-out as become acquaintances, game buddies, friends. DST, while with many differences to its predecessor Don't Starve, can be played alone, with no player slots open or a password. But most people, yours truly included, find soloing with no other transients around rather upsetting after a longer while. Your character may be thriving on their own, but your own mind will keep processing the eerie solitude of this fascinating world. \n\nDisclaimer: my game copy was a gift. Since then, I have been picking DST as a go-to present. Another friend of mine is scheduled to receive her own for Christmas.

Me and my friend had everything stocked up; tons of bunnies in the chests, two ice boxes filled with food from our farms and drying racks, two crockpots just for those nights that you needed really filling food, two themal stones, enough clothing to keep warmth for a decent distance away from base camp.\n\nHad a wall built with three or so beefalo corralled in so that we could get manure and beefalo wool during the night. Honestly, we had this entire thing down set, winter wasn't going to beat us. \n\nHe said he was going to the bathroom and left me to tend to the fire to keep us through the night. Naturally, I didn't have any problem with that- surely we were set for a night. \n\nAnd then my character heard something in the distance, something that was getting closer increasingly faster. Thinking it was just a wolf, I grabbed my spear and armor, wolves weren't anything to worry about. \n\nExcept the ground shook the closer it came, rattling every item on the map until this amalgamation of horror came onto the screen; giant antlers protruded out from above a single wide eye, every exhale this creature took gathered in a fog from it's mouth hole, every single stomp from a gigantic hoof sent rows of jagged ice along the ground like piston. \n\nWhen my friend came back from the bathroom, everything was gone. He died instantly, unable to move or defend himself from the Deerclops, a sad ghost who could only haunt my already dwindling sanity through the duration of the very short fight. The Deerclops knew how to get me too, chasing me around my own camp until the fire inevitably went out, unable to throw anything into the fire for fear that the behemoth creature would kill me instantly just as he did my defenseless friend. Blind now in the darkness, all I could do was run around some more in a desperate attempt to find my fire pit before Charlie bore down on me, snuffling out the last vestiges of health I had before it was all over. \n\nWhat happened?! My friend exclaimed when he came back, incredulous that this much could happen in a span of a few spare minutes, the monochromatic view on his screen the same as the utter failure that was on my own. \n\nIndeed, my friend, what happened? \n\n10/10 Would play again", "timestamp_created": 1457669131, "timestamp_updated": 1457669189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 119, "votes_funny": 199, "weighted_vote_score": "0.857816934585571289", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "44889563": {"recommendationid": "44889563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163727394", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1542949557}, "language": "english", "review": "\n\"You don't win, you just do a little better each time.\"\n", "timestamp_created": 1537697067, "timestamp_updated": 1537697067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.825283586978912354", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34259071": {"recommendationid": "34259071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174838851", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 23636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504235878}, "language": "english", "review": "Single-player Don't Starve has been one of my favorite games for years.

If you are wanting to buy this game, but you intend to only play it by yourself, then I strongly suggest you stop now, don't get this game, and get the original Don't Starve along with its DLCs instead. If you still want to get this game, then I'm just going to say that there is a lot to learn about this game and you'll need to know stuff about the original Don't Starve as well. \n\nYou don't need to know the plot of the original game to know what Don't Starve is about. Even though it is a sequel in a way, you don't need to know what happened. Basically, you're going to be dropped into a world and you are going to have only one goal, survive as long as you can. There is a lore to the game, and it is an incredibly rich lore that should definitely get some sort of attention because it's really interesting and ever so more expanding. The world is already interesting enough with the kind of creatures it holds and what each of the playable characters can do, but it's that lore that does make this world all the much the better once you know it. \n\nRight off the bat, the game spews charm from it. From character and monster designs, to the artstyle, the old vintage look, and even down the music which sounds like what you would imagine the world would have. I can sit on the main menu of this game for hours to listen to the theme. \n\nYou'll have 12 characters to pick and choose who you'll play as, each one with different stats and different abilities that make them stand out from each other. For players who have already played Don't Starve, you won't have to worry about these characters needing to be unlocked, they're all unlocked right out of the gate. Also for players who have played Don't Starve, the characters have changed a bit in order to be a bit more balanced for multiplayer. Each character fits a different play style so you'll never feel as though you're playing as the same character, and you can feel the differences with each character and you'll find someone with a playstyle who you'll enjoy playing as the most.\n\nThis game is not easy and if you are new, you'll probably not survive for very long in it especially if you do not know what to do. The game is not going to teach you anything, you'll either have to learn to survive as you play, learn from other players, or research about the game. At no point are you ever going to be safe. You'll have to eat to keep yourself from starving, find ways to restore your character's sanity so that way you don't go insane and be attacked by shadow creatures, fire can spread and destroy precious resources, some resources can't respawn, some creatures will attack and try to kill you, and there will be a pack of hounds that will randomly come after you as you go through each day. Even changing seasons will be a hazard as you'll either have to survive the cold of winter, the storms of spring, or the heat of summer. It may be hard to get into first, but once you get a grasp of the game and how it plays, it feels so satisifying to be able to survive longer than you used to. You'll need to craft items to survive and even craft items to craft even more items and you'll need as much as you can and know exactly what you need to survive for so long.\n\nThe one thing that stands about this game over the original Don't Starve is that this one has online multiplayer where you can play up to 6 other people. You can play by yourself, but it won't be easier than playing with others unless you have mods supported by the Steam Workshop. If you're going to play this game with others, I highly recommend playing with friends. \n\nIf there is one thing I can say about this game is that it will get reptitive. Once you get the hang of the game, it's just a matter of surviving as long as you can and if you are able to learn the game to the point where you know everything about it, you'll have nearly nothing to worry about. \n\nIf you want a challenging survival game and one that you can play with friends, this game is definitely for you and I can highly recommend it to others. Even though it can get repetitive after a while, I still find it to be a fun game where you'll always have to be doing something to survive and keep going, and with the developers continuing to add more stuff to the game and showing a great passion for it, I can see it being supported for a long time.", "timestamp_created": 1509856904, "timestamp_updated": 1512233970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.866670548915863037", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14101441": {"recommendationid": "14101441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118013112", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1540507725}, "language": "english", "review": "Loving the game so far, heres my review: \nTBH it got really boring when playing alone ( Meaning when we didn't have DT:Together), but when you\nhave someone else with you surviving its an epic experience! \n\nThe game stays fresh because you usually find something new and interesting to do every time you play, like crafting something entirely new or making your base better etc.\nTheres randomly generated maps and with them comes randomly some structures, huts etc. I think i haven't seen all of them yet but still, really cool touch\n\nThe artwork is really pretty, and personally i liked the fact that when some of the characters talk (for example, Wilson) \nYou hear random screeching-kind words, thought that was pretty cool :D\n\nThere's alot of animals and enemies to discover, and some of them will help you survive\nThe designs of the mobs have been done pretty well and look really cool.\nTheres ''bosses'' too, i don't know if thats the real name of them since there aren't like a special place where \nyou can fight them, they just kinda appear\n\nOnly flaw i've really seen is that the fighting is kinda clumsy at times, maybe it can be improved somehow, this is my personal opinion though :) \n\nOverall, its a great game with huge world to explore and best played with friends! \nI would recommend this to almost every gamer :)\n\n( My first ''real'' review, so its not perfect )", "timestamp_created": 1421869646, "timestamp_updated": 1421869646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 87, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.823632717132568359", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "45488900": {"recommendationid": "45488900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153185398", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 197624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4409, "last_played": 1551818151}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't tell now i like this game or not.

That's probably what drove me to buy it. My friend also happened to have Don't Starve Together, so we could play together. The game definitely isn't as much fun without friends, lemme tell ya.\n\nSo the game was fifteen dollars. It seemed like a pretty decent price, and I thought, \"well, why the heck not?\" So, to checkout I go. I had HIGH expectations, and I was worried that since I kind of knew about the game already, I would miss out on the experience of exploring it myself.\n\nHaha... I'm laughing because I was an idiot.\n\n\n[h1]WHAT DON'T STARVE TOGETHER IS[/h1]\n\nDon't Starve Together has the amazing features of Don't Starve, except it's multiplayer and there's a different story. The art is dauntingly adorable. What do I mean by that? The art sets you into a world about survival and its dangers. I seriously love it. The type of art compliments the gameplay style perfectly, and it makes the game [i]that[/i] much more enjoyable.\n\nYou're thrown into an unforgiving world. There are tons of monsters, darkness that will swallow you whole, and lands that will try to kill you. But along with this sparks fascination. You have to survive in a crude world, learning along the way, picking up tips & tricks, and gathering tons of knowledge.\n\nThis is definitely my favorite survival game. It has greath depth, it's compelling, and extremely creative. The crafting aspect is fun, and exploring things is just simply enchanting.\n\nThe [b]purpose of Don't Starve Together[/b] is to play with friends, and I definitely recommend so. It's much more fun if you play with other people.\n\nI usually recommend buying Don't Starve Together instead of Don't Starve, because in DST (Don't Starve Together) you can play both singleplayer and multiplayer. The only difference is the story. DST's story is a continuation of the original and classic Don't Starve. But honestly, the story isn't as important in my opinion, as the game can be a total sandbox and is much more valuable because it has multiplayer. It's meant more to be a sandbox type game, but the story can be important (it depends on the player).\n\nIf you're someone who doesn't play mutliplayer, then get Don't Starve. Otherwise I recommend Don't Starve Together. Even then, there are public servers you can join and play with other strangers.... totally trustworthy.\n\n[h1]PLAYING[/h1]\n\nI really, [i]really[/i] love this game. So far, I've played 130 hours in total. I wasted a lot of time. ([i]A lot[/i]). There's a lot to explore, and with 130 hours... I honestly haven't gotten into half the game yet! I know. I should've by now. But there's a seriously fun aspect with Don't Starve Together that won't let you drop it, and I'm surprised I haven't written this review sooner.\n\nThe great part is, there are tons of different mods created by the community that can impact your game. You should really get them. They're awesome, and yes, trustworthy. They're located in the workshop (in case you're wondering). And they seriously make your game much more fun. If you ever get the game and want to know what mods I recommend, please message in the comments below. There are lot of different mods, but there are some extremely important ones that make your game easier and more immersive.\n\nExploring was so much fun. The whole aspect reminds me of Stardew Valley, but to me there are a lot more things to discover in Don't Starve Together, and with friends it's amazing. You really shouldn't underestimate the game. It has a lot to offer, and is popular for a fantastic reason: it's purely great.\n\n[i]\"It's definitely a better game with friends. And it can be spooky & scary, especially if you don't know what's going on (rlly now?). I swear if you write this word for word-\"[/i] - Quote from Kuep. \n\n^^^ He read it. [i]\"You're a spaghetti-o-\"[/i], he says.\n\nDon't Starve Together is very unique, comedic, and fun overall. Much recommendation. I had a lot of moments where I died laughing, a lot of \"WTF\" moments, and honestly the game is a great excuse to have a good time with your friends. So if you wanna trick people into liking you, play this with them.\n\n[h1]THE PROS[/h1]\n\n- Adorable art. It fits the game perfectly, and you will love it's cuteness.\n\n- Fun characters. Each default character has a backstory and unique personalities and weapons.\n\n- Mods. Mods made by the community that makes your game extremely fun. You will love your life once you get them. Seriously.\n\n- Exploration. Lots o' exploration. Lots o' fun. Enuff said.\n\n- Challenge. The game offers challenges to those who like it, and even with normal gameplay you have to survive hunger and sanity. You can customize your settings to what you want on Don't Starve Together, and I really think that's fantastic.\n\n- Uniqueness. It may have the classic but fun \"survive\" theme, but it has unique gameplay (you'll see what I mean if you buy it. Which you should.)\n\n- Constantly updated. Constantly updated with new and old things from Don't Starve, and that's great. Games that don't update sometimes get boring, but with an alive workshop community and constant updates, that sure won't happen soon.\n\n- Music. It's daunting. It's revving. It's themed perfectly. What more could you ask for?\n\n\n[h1]THE CONS[/h1]\n\n- Connection issues. Sometimes even though your wifi works on both ends servers get a little laggy, but it doesn't happen that much. Watch out if the person hosting the server has terrible wifi. You will hate them and your life.\n\n- Imcompatible mods. This is not really a con, but it IS something you should be aware of. There are mods in the workshop that won't work with each other, and sometimes they will crash your game. This is annoying because if you subscribe to a lot of mods you have to go through each one to see which is crashing your game. For the most part, most mods are working fine. It's more of the, \"ehhhh\"-looking mods that don't work, (which is kind of obvious).\n\n- Sometimes crashes. Sometimes Don't Starve Together has file issues and crashes your game. It happens rarely, but it is something to watch out for. No, none of these crashes deleted any of my progress, which is excellent. The game autosaves quite frequently. (Now that I think about it I've never had to save myself... Wait is there even a manual save button???)\n\n\n[h1]PLACES TO IMPROVE[/h1]\n\n- Crashes. Please fix file issues that occur randomly. A lot of users do have this, but as I said, it doesn't wipe any progress whatsoever.\n\n- New biomes. I would love if there were new biomes. Something fascinating.\n\n- New items. I would like new items. Once you play the game you realize there isn't that much diversity, but that's where mods come in! Hah. Still please make new items. <3\n\n\n[h1]DON'T STARVE YOURSELF HESITATING TO BUY THE GAME (I'm bloody hilarious)[/h1]\n\nIt's fun as hell, and I had a lot of fun with this game. It is a game where you have to constantly look out for not dying, but there's [i]so[/i] much fun being chased to death by hounds. Trust me. It's a first-time experience. (I don't know if it is for you, though... o_o). And the fact that everyone is screaming that there's a gigantic black flea trying to chomp you (aka, the hounds) makes it all-the-while.\n\nI want to stress about the art, because it really does fit well.

If you wanna go beyond bear grylls such as even starting to the game in summer or winter and if you wanna know every little detail about every item every mob etc, expect to play it alot. If you do not like playing many hours, dieing countless times to learn the game and if you don't like playing survival games, you should not touch to this game. You can go play other genres. It is a kind of trial and error game. You should learn by dieing, by reading articles in wikia and/or watching streams. Seems hard at first but everything is in details. There is no problem without an OP solution. If you know that detail you will likely survive or some situations may need taking many things into consideration. Surely having a base is cool but, if you want a challenge you should know that you don't need any base to survive in this game and it is pretty easy to do so (If you really know what you are doing).\n\nMost of the mobs are one way or another hostile (well some neutral mobs are available but most of the neutral mobs got special times and they become hostile in those periods). So most mobs can be hostile towards you means that you can be curious about finding out what kind of mob but do not approach too close to experiment if you got no idea about the mob or if you got someone in the server you can ask info so you know what kinda mob is the one that you saw. Do not think that you are the only one who is not liked in the world. Some mobs are also hostile towards any other mobs including player etc so you can take advantage of these opportunities. Wanna fight? If you do not have any armor do not do that (only real pros with very good ping can fight without any armor)... You will be dead in mostly 3-4 hits because never forget that you are a paper tiger without an armor and kiting skills.

Resurrecting dead players becomes a larger part of the game on these servers. \n\nCommunication is much more important on large servers. With more players, the chance of running into a serious threat increases. Dealing with those threats sometimes requires a quick response and that is much harder to accomplish when there is no easy way to tell where teammates are short of clear and frequent communication.\n\nOn top of those challenges, having many players occupy the same bit of land leads to a greater chance of resource scarcity. On small servers, this isn't as much of an issue. On large servers, often vital resources have been picked dry when a new player joins the server, leaving them to face the night with no fire or weapon.\n\nAll of these problems can be addressed by the players with some forethought and planning, but these are issues unique to larger servers. If you play alone or with 1-2 other people, then the game is challenging without having to worry about these additional challenges. Of course, if you want a significantly greater challenge than what the single player or small server game offers, then a large server is for you. Aside from the disparity in difficulty between small and large servers, this game is everything you could want from a multiplayer experience of 'Don't Starve.' Everything that made the single player game great is here.

The game relies on player deduction and intuition - there are zero tutorials or handholding, you will die a plethora of generally reasonable and in hindsight easily avoidable ways.

That being said, unlike 'Don't Starve' the more challenging single player game that spawned this iteration, when you die your world and progress doesn't 'generally' reset - since other players/means can easily revive you. The active player base is generally quite helpful to new players within reason. \n\nIf you buy this game, do not think you are entitled to know/join an established base on a server without proving you are an asset and not a liability - or griefer first (Survive some days solo and gather resources to contribute!) The variety of things to do that often change seasonally or in the separate caves/ruins layer along with procedural generation keeps gameplay fresh and engaging. Most of the Early access issues (and there were a lot) have been fixed. \n\nGenerally there is at least 1-2 bugfix updates every week, and with the free 'Through the ages' DLC being steadily implemented, content updates come out every month or so. On the whole, I recommend this game as a good way to make some friends, spend far more time of your life than intended in game feasting while ironically starving IRL, and of course - mostly having fun enjoying the many challenges DST offers!\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1468550414, "timestamp_updated": 1468550414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.760314643383026123", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34742026": {"recommendationid": "34742026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120273788", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 2056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1523116996}, "language": "english", "review": "[spoiler] You'll actually Starve in this game [/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1504552534, "timestamp_updated": 1504552534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 85, "votes_funny": 105, "weighted_vote_score": "0.810011684894561768", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42674200": {"recommendationid": "42674200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155395155", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1526393260}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't Starve Together\n\nThis game i just love it the music the grapich the mecanic i just love it one,of the best survivor coop games i ever played.\n\n---{Graphics}---\n\u2716 Masterpiece\n\u2705 Beautiful\n\u2716 Good\n\u2716 Decent\n\u2716 Will do\n\u2716 Bad\n\u2716 Awful\n\u2716 Paint.exe\n\n---{Audio}---\n\u2705 Eargasm\n\u2716 Very good\n\u2716 Good\n\u2716 Decent\n\u2716 Earrape\n\n---{Gameplay}--- \n\u2716 Try not to get addicted \n\u2705 Very good\n\u2716 Good\n\u2716 Nothing special\n\u2716 Ehh\n\u2716 Bad\n\u2716 Just dont\n\n---{Audience}--- \n\u2705 Kids\n\u2705 Teens\n\u2705 Adults\n\u2705 Everyone\n\n---{PC Requirements}--- \n\u2716 Check if you can run paint\n\u2705 Potato\n\u2716 Minimum\n\u2716 Decent\n\u2716 Fast\n\u2716 Rich boi\n\u2716 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Difficulity}--- \n\u2716 Just press a bunch of buttons\n\u2716 Easy\n\u2716 Significant brain\n\u2716 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2705 Not so easy\n\u2716 Difficult\n\u2716 Dark Souls\n\n\n---{Game Time}--- \n\u2716 Long enough for a cup of tea\n\u2716 Short\n\u2716 Average\n\u2716 Long\n\u2716 Depends on u\n\u2705 Endless\n\n---{Bugs}--- \n\u2705 Never had any\n\u2716 Minor bugs\n\u2716 Few bugs \n\u2716 Can get annoying\n\u2716  Ruining the game\n\u2716 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs", "timestamp_created": 1528805311, "timestamp_updated": 1528805311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 231, "votes_funny": 66, "weighted_vote_score": "0.842504441738128662", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15815017": {"recommendationid": "15815017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186532422", "num_games_owned": 616, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451895919}, "language": "english", "review": "+Absolutely the best co-op game (with friends) I ever played, it is better than L4Ds, better than Paydays\n+Introduced this to my girlfriend (who is a non-gamer), and she was instantly hooked and developed a passion for Webber, so this is the best \"plot to convert target girl into gamer\" game\n+This game reminds me of life and growing up.

Your main goal is to establish a base camp, gather items, and find a way to make your required resources (mainly food and heat) sustainable\u2014all while avoiding the monsters that lurk in the dark. The added element of a sanity meter makes for an intriguing twist in gameplay that often requires the player to make less practical equipment (such as flower crowns) as well as the more obvious items (like farms).\n\nAs someone who's apparently unable to last more than six days without starving (or more likely being eaten by monsters in the dark), I had hoped that being able to play with a buddy might reduce my death count... in truth it's a lot harder to feed two people than it is to feed one! I found myself constantly out in the beefalo fields, gathering fertilizer only to run it back to my partner, eat a few carrots, and then run back out into the fields to gather even more poop while barely surviving.\n\nDon't Starve is a fascinatingly challenging game with rich and diverse settings, an intriguingly vague story, spectacularly crafted sound effects, and a bevy of triumphs and heartaches for the casual player and the expert alike. It's made even more engaging (and difficult) with the addition of multiplayer.\n\nDon't starve alone\u2014starve together!", "timestamp_created": 1446608251, "timestamp_updated": 1446608251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.780822634696960449", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 73, "review_score": 9, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "total_positive": 33910, "total_negative": 1455, "total_reviews": 35365}}
