Third time's a charm, right? I realize the previous iterations weren't all that good at getting the point across. So now, I'll make it clear why, exactly, I don't recommend this game. The short version is, its story (its main selling point) is weak, lackluster and ends in the most generic way I could probably think of. Its gameplay is below average, though I won't fault it too much for that, the game's twelve years old. There's a serious lack of character interaction. And the only redeeming quality is represented by the environments, which are, well, decent. \n\nNow, the long version. \n\nWelcome to Rapture. You are a guy who ends up in a plane crash right next to the entrance into Rapture, the underwater anarcho-capitalist utopia created by a very rich guy. However, as you descend into it, you soon discover that the Eden it once was became something akin to hell. \n\nAnd here comes my very first complaint: The lack of character interaction. \n\nFrom the very beginning, you are guided by voices. Radio, recordings. There is a serious lack of character interaction, and it very easily gets tiring to just listen to characters you've never met. Recordings are supposed to tell the story of how the city turned into such a ruin, but only a bunch of them do that. The rest are just random characters talking about totally unrelated things. To make matters worse, tapes seem to appear at random, and if you've already cleared a room and moved out of it, you never know if another tape might pop up into it, causing you to miss it. The game hardly ever requires you to come back to the same room twice. And never to the same level. And let's be real now, did every freaking person in Rapture carry a tape recorder and tapes with them to record and throw about? It just doesn't make any sense. \n\nThe gameplay, itself, is an endless stream of \"fetch this\" \"kill this guy\" \"fetch that\" \"go here\" \"go there\" and so on. I will choose not to fault it too much for that, it's an older game. Still, they could've been a little creative about it. \n\nEnemy variety: Splicers are your enemies. You have either splicers who use melee attacks, splicers who use guns, splicers who use hooks and splicers who use powers. That's it. And for being so few types, they sure are many because you can never catch a break. Much like the tapes, they appear in rooms you've already cleared once, and well, anywhere else for that matter. And then you have Big Daddies. \n\nThey are definitely the most annoying type of enemies. Whether they like to charge at you or shoot at you, BDs are your worst enemies, provided you angered them. Worst part is that you'll have to fight quite a few, so stock up on everything because they don't go down all that easy. Some people find this challenging, but I say it's dreadful because they hardly have any kind of tactics. They just stomp you into the ground and that's it. \n\nAnd then, you get to the big twist. The big reveal that everyone seems to get wet about. \n\n\"A man chooses, a slave obeys.\" It's by far the one statement that will be drilled into your head as you play, whether its via a tooltip message during loading screens or via the one man to whom the quote belongs. Well, I choose to detach myself from the hive mind that the game's fan base seems to be and state, loud and clear, that the big twist is nothing but a fart in the wind. To keep spoilers out, I won't say a thing about it, but don't expect fireworks. Don't expect anything, in fact, I did and I faced one of the worst disappointments I've felt with a game before. And what's even worse, the character whom I quoted makes the most nonsensical kind of choice I've ever been faced with. \n\nAs for the morality-oriented storyline bit, well... aside from one choice related to morals which mildly affects the ending, that's about it. Don't go in expecting to be given too many choices or options. \n\nAnd in regards to the ending, well, I did not get to it. After being so disappointed with the supposedly peak moment of the game, I simply chose to not bother any longer, not waste any more time and read up on the ending.

It has a great story, moments of surprise and interesting twists. You have freedom to make your choices. To be a good person or a bad person. Moral dilemma which is very straightforward in Bioshock. You can very easily predict how it will influence the ending. But that's not where your freedom ends.\n\nYou can decide whether to destroy or hack security bots, cameras and turrets. You can use weapons you like the most and you can upgrade them. You can choose active and passive abilities (combat, engineering and physical) according to your playstyle, preferences and situations. You can collect items and craft! You can buy items in vending machines and if you hack them you can even reduce the prices there! You can take pictures of enemies with your camera and yield rewards for it. You can also roam around, explore and possibly find valuable items.\n\nSo many choices!!! But can you really choose?\n\nThe voice acting is excellent. All the voices talking to you via radio and all the audio recordings you find give you some kind of clue about what was going on. The game looks great. Very impressive graphics.\n\nNow would you kindly look out of a window of underwater city of Rapture at least once?", "timestamp_created": 1446655553, "timestamp_updated": 1446657519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 115, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.897744178771972656", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12494575": {"recommendationid": "12494575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022997080", "num_games_owned": 1750, "num_reviews": 361, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413329896}, "language": "english", "review": "Bioshock was a genre shifting masterpiece upon release.\n\nLooking back, there are some cracks in its foundation that stand out a bit more obviously today after so many reiterations and refinements have been made to first person shooters on the whole, but that the experience is still such a rich, deep, and enthralling one is a testament to how incredible it originally was.\n\nBioshock is first and foremost the story of Rapture, an underwater utopia plunged into chaos by its own design of rejecting traditional ideology. It was a city created to be a safe haven for the most ambitious and intelligent people of the world to tap into their full potential; to experiment and create, free from the burden of morals and law found in the world above. Along with this came the discovery of a gene altering drug known as Adam, which when injected alters the hosts genetic code and bestows superhuman powers to them, from shooting fire from your fingertips to telekinesis and mind control. In a city removed from natural order restrained only by owns own ingenuity, the thirst for power eventually led to the city's demise.\n\nEntering this decrepit city as a castaway from a crashed airplane is among the most impressive and memorable opening sequences to any video game I've ever played. It's a perfectly executed series of events, informing you both of what the city once was and the nightmarish hell it became in a matter of moments, before leading you into an astonishingly well crafted world that devours you whole in its overpowering atmosphere. Everywhere you look there are callbacks, visual cues and audio diaries that retell what life was like in Rapture, and how it got to be the way it is. The sense of place and level of detail carved into the environment informing you not only what Rapture was, but what it represented, is an astounding achievement in world design and environmental narratives. There's never a room that feels out of place, or an oddly written character; it all fits together in this twisted world of objectivism steeped in the writings of Ayn Rand, so successfully realized it's almost frighteningly easy to see how a city like Rapture could potentially come about.\n\nMuch of this is presented non-verbally, with art deco banners and store fronts, dated vending machines, and various subtle hints at Rapture's history peppering the environment and bringing it to life. The disturbing sounds and dialogues of the splicers inhabiting the city add a level of characterization to enemies that turns them into more than soulless targets, providing a glimpse into their backstories and bizarre relationships, and at times making me hesitant to actually kill them (at least until they tried to). \n\nThe world design is so strong in fact that it largely overshadows the core narrative of your character, one which stays in the background until roughly 2/3 of the way through, and then ends in a rather disappointingly cliched manner. It's not to say it's bad, as when the plot finally comes to the forefront it does it in a way that's startling and unforgettable, but it seems almost secondary in many ways to the numerous auxiliary stories you hear as you make your way through rapture. It's there to keep the experience on a straight path, but it's not what drives it.\n\nWith how much depth and originality was given to creating this remarkable world, it's a remarkable feat that just as much work has been put into Bioshock's combat mechanics. Utilizing plasmids, the same substances that turned the citizens of Rapture insane, adds a host of combat options to the standard gunplay, often working in tandem with each other to open the game up for dozens of different tactics that makes combat almost like a puzzle as you mix and match the tools at your disposal to find the most potent combinations (one of my favorites was the \"one-two punch\" of electrocuting a splicer, the enemies of the game, and then delivering a hefty hit with the wrench). Being able to carry an entire arsenal with you further broadens your capabilities, allowing you an immense amount of freedom in how you approach encounters and with it coming a welcome amount of variety.\n\nThe inventiveness and distinction of each enemy you face layers on yet another element to combat encounters, from the different ways splicers react to you and each other (from running straight forward, arms flailing, to climbing the walls and dropping down from above), to the intense encounters with Big Daddies: huge enemies outfitted with an enormously powerful drill and far more speed an maneuverability than there colossal diving suit bodies would have you believe. These fights are brutal and require you to more carefully time your attack and fine tune your strategy, often using the environment and traps you set to your advantage as a head on approach is almost certainly suicidal.\n\nThe few areas that Bioshock trips up on are largely the result of the existence of its more mechanically sophisticated sequel, which streamlined the tedious hacking minigame and added dual wielding to make combat faster and more fluid.. They aren't huge issues in the overall picture, but it does make returning to the original harder than I'd imagined and would likely seem a bit clumsy to those who played the other two games first (which I would certainly advise against).\n\nDespite all the years since its release, very few games have managed to match the scope and creativity of Bioshock's world and mechanics (even its own two sequels). It's an astounding achievement in every area of its design, and the sort of game that would be fair to consider something of a requirement to play. It's among the most amazing games I've ever played, as well as one of my personal favorites that I see myself continuing to return to as without fail I fall back in love with it again.\n\n[b]You can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2014/10/14/bioshock-review/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1413334820, "timestamp_updated": 1425146083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 344, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.939681589603424072", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23372232": {"recommendationid": "23372232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026330587", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473521142}, "language": "english", "review": "I am extremely Jealous of anyone who hasn't played this yet and gets to experience it for the first time.

Has its lows like most though but I have to say it impressed me how the story develops and gives you much more than what you could get by just running through shooting things (like you do in some shooters). \n\nIt's a different shooter in most ways, let's say shooting weapons is not what you'll be doing the most in the entire game, you'll have these kind of superpower things named plasmids which are the aquired and upgraded as you advance and consume a meter bar named eve each time you use them. Also hacking stuff (security cameras, turrets) is a good part of it if you decide to, which is somesort of minigame but very helpful IMO.\n\nIt's kind of easy if you ask me. I spent the entire game trying to save on everything, I mean, always have the maximum medipacks, the maximum ammo for every gun, etc. Every single bullet was important. I regret that choice as I ended up with most of my arsenal and currency unused. Yes you can run half of the game thru just using very little ammo/eve and just melee attacking your enemies with a wrench (default attack). Of course you'll have a lot more fun if you use guns/plasmids which I recommend you to. There are some unbalanced plasmids however, but try all of them so you can see for yourself which ones you like the most.\n\nAlso, if you want to get the most of the story you should try to listen as many records as you can, helps you understand the whole thing (you'll find them randomly across the entire game).\n\nYou'll definitely have a good time playing this.

A FPS at its core, and the spiritual successor of the [i]System Shock[/i] series, [b]Bioshock[/b] is rooted in a strong and established foundation. But it isn\u2019t just any other FPS game that will be mildly fun and then quickly forgotten. It is so much more than that. The fantastic gameworld design, the gripping atmosphere, the mysterious narrative, the idiosyncratic characters, and the uniquely identifying combat system all contribute to propelling this game into the elite caste. It is a legendary masterwork of gaming culture, and I posit: anyone who has yet to experience it would be wise to change that.\n\nWith the high quality of all of the aspects of the game, it is difficult to name one as the \u201cbest.\u201d But I would have to argue the most defining and inspired aspect is the wondrous and mystical gameworld atmosphere. The captivating atmosphere will grab hold of you from the opening scene and not let go until the ending credits. The world of [i]Rapture[/i] is an absolute pleasure to explore and the ominous, dystopian ambiance is splendidly engaging. And it isn\u2019t just the obvious things, but also the little subtleties and minute details that really elevate the gameworld atmosphere to elite status. The attention to detail is outstanding. [b]Bioshock[/b] has an undeniably \u201cA+\u201d presentation.\n\nThe narrative elements of the game are also exquisite. There is a main storyline that unfolds as you play and there is also a clouded history of lore that slowly becomes clear as you progress the game and discover the collectibles (which provide backstory). This multidirectional storytelling will keep you curious to learn more at all times, adroitly holding your interest as you make your way through the campaign. Moreover, the well-designed character development leads to interesting and idiosyncratic NPCs that are infinitely more intriguing than the usual forgettable clich\u00e9s. It all amounts to an overall experience that will keep you engaged and entertained.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay and combat, it is quite unique and variable. Nevertheless, I will admit that it isn\u2019t necessarily the most riveting combat system around. But, as you are part gunslinger and part spellcaster, you can wreak havoc on your foes in a wide variety of ways. That, and the ability to purchase upgrades for your gear and abilities will keep the combat fresh and interesting throughout a playthrough.  Aside from that, there are also many collectibles to search for, there is loot hidden all over, and there are hundreds of interesting little things to look at. There is a lot going on.\n\nThe last thing I\u2019ll specifically mention regarding [b]Bioshock[/b] is that I believe a large reason as to why it is so well received in the gaming community is because of all of the little things that were done right in allowing the player to decide how he/she wants to play the game. For instance, there is a great autosave/checkpoint system that won\u2019t screw you over if you mess up and there is also an option for unlimited respawns (if you choose to use it). On top of that, you are free to manually save whenever you want. Or you can turn off respawns and never manually save if that\u2019s your preference. Also, there is a large amount of lore, backstory, and narrative elements, but there isn\u2019t hours of forced dialogue or unskippable cutscenes. You are mostly free to choose how much you want to learn or how much you want to plow through the game. This fundamentally open design allows for a wide audience to easily enjoy the game. \n\n[b]Bioshock[/b] is a great game. If you haven\u2019t checked it out yet, you would be wise to make time. It will definitely appeal to most gamers, especially fans of FPS games, RPGs, and strong narrative elements.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1457588879, "timestamp_updated": 1457589304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 102, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.880808889865875244", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12812695": {"recommendationid": "12812695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004483355", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1320649200}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Bioshock: A Tale of Poor City Planning[/h1]\n\nBioshock is great.

The game takes place in a ciy called Rapture, a city under the sea created by Andre Ryan to be a utopia, where people's dreams would not be limited by things such as government or morality. You play as Jack, a man in a plane crash that landed in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, who finds a Lighthouse that leads to Rapture, now ruined and destroyed due to a war created by Atlas, a man who leads a rebellion group against Andrew Ryan, and wants to help you survive as you fight Splicers (genetic mutants created by splicing up on something called ADAM; a substance found at the bottom of the ocean that can be used for a variety of purpose. Medical, entertainment, or even getting powers called Plasmids) and Big Daddies, protecters of the Little Sisters, who hold sea slugs in their stomachs that produce loads of ADAM.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic. Bioshock is a FPS with RPG and Survival Horror elements. You can geta total of 6 different guns throughout the game, each of which are good for certain situations. You can also upgrade these guns to make them stronger and better over the course of the game. You can also collect different types of ammo for each gun, usually there's a normal type, a type good for armored foes, and a type good for fleshy foes. Then of course, there's ADAM. ADAM is obtained after killing a Big Daddy, then by making a decision on whether or not to let their Little Sister to live. If they live, you get some ADAM, but for every 3 you rescue, you get rewards. Or, you can harvest them and get a huge amount of ADAM, but no rewards. ADAM can be spent on Plasmids and Tonics. Plasmids are you're alternative to guns, basically giving you special powers over the course of the game. Tonics give you're character direct upgrades, of which have varying degrees of usefulness. The gameplay has so many layaers of depth and strategy, and is still realy good in high-strung intense action moments. And it's just plain fun to shoot bees at a splicer, then set them on fire, and when they jump into water to get rid of the fire, you can eletrocute them and finish them off.\n\nEven if the gameplay wasn't good, the story alone is worth the buy. I won't spoil it, nor will I reiterate what I already wrote, but know that the story of Bioshock is not only one of the best, most though-provoking stories there is, but the best part about it is that it could only work as a video game, nothing else, as the story brings up the idea of whether or not the player's choices have an impact, and whether or not the player actually had a choice throughout the whole game. It helps that all the characters in the game are very complex and believable. I could write an entire essay about how amazing the story is, but I won't because I don't feel like wasting you're time. Now, would you kindly buy this freaking game already?", "timestamp_created": 1415586080, "timestamp_updated": 1415586080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.809155642986297607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9416598": {"recommendationid": "9416598", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986992213", "num_games_owned": 2883, "num_reviews": 175, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1394225370}, "language": "english", "review": "In BioShock you are a survivor of a plane crash in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. You are able to make your way to an island where a submarine is waiting to take you to into the great depths below where the mysterious underwater city of Rapture awaits. The city is trashed and genetic freaks called splicers roam around, attacking anything that gets in front of them. In order to survive you will have fight through these Splicers and other oddities keeping your eyes and ears open for clues into what has gone wrong, how you may be able to help or how you can escape.\nOne aspect that makes the storyline work so well is the way it is told. BioShock uses a real time method of telling the story through random radio reports, overheard conversations and audio recordings.\nYou can choose from a variety of different weapons, anywhere from pistols and shotguns to chemical throwers and grenade launchers. Each gun has different ammo that you can use. There are also many plasmids that you can use. You can electrify the water to kill everyone in it, set people on fire, freeze them and then smash them with a wrench, among other things.\nThe graphics in this game are good, out of date, but still good.\nThe sound of BioShock really puts you into the game. From the creepy things the splicers say to the background music, everything fits perfect.\nBioShock builds a great atmosphere by using terrific graphics and sound to set a creepy mood.

A wonder.\n\nFor me, it has a much more value than Bioshock 2 or Infinite, because it was before, and it said it all, loud and clear.\n\nI don't believe you've not heard a thing about Bioshock, it would be a total bewilderment!\nYet I must state there, that Bioshock was like a grasp of fresh air for a submariner, when it hit the shelves in the 2007.\n\nIn the thick of of bleak and obtuse FPS games, flooded all stocks and minds, Bioshock felt like a blessing from above. Ken Levine made his brightest shot into the eternity. Bioshock is a Magnum Opus. A real deal stuff. A resurrection of System Shock principles with the isogenic battle system (mixture of guns, guts, wits and magic), with modern, looking-better-than-Half-Life-2-graphics, and deep, dark, sound and comprehensive story. Again mankind was looking for salvation, but drowned itself by ever-growing sins like greed, powerlust, and false infallibility.\n\nA miraculous experience of witnessing the end of time and humanity. A travel to mad scientist inner space. A nice reason to forget about sleep, in my book.\n\nMark is 8.5/10: the narrative falls down a little in the very end, and there are some other distracting little things on the way through Rapture, that keeps me from praising Bioshock as \"the-best-my-eyes-ever-seen!\" title.

Jack as the only survivor lands in Rapture, an underwater city built by the business magnate Andrew Ryan. Once a great city, now desolated by war caused by powerhungry people, Jack has to escape from a city while fighting through hordes of obsessed enemies, the iconic, deadly Big Daddies, and even few insane people that remind of city's past.\n\nBioShock is a first-person shooter with role-playing game elements and even stealth, similar to System Shock 2. \nGame is linear, as you move from one location to another while doing objectives to progress further in the story. You can even return to previous location you've been in, although I never saw a point in it as locations are easy to clear at once.\n\nIn combat you will use a variety of weapons, each with 3 different types of ammunition for different types of enemies, and plasmids, a superhuman powers granted by ADAM, a genetic material that allows you to have them.\nYou can freeze, you can shock, you can control, you can even set up traps! Plasmids give you a big advantage. You will need EVE to use them, and you can get that from EVE syringes collected in a world. As for health, you can easily eat everything you will find on your way to replenish it, or use medkits! \nAs for enemies, there is an interesting variety of them. From melee enemies, to enemies that even can climb on walls, you will have to adapt to them and use your weapons  and powers properly! ...Don't worry, a lot of bullets can also do the trick.\nOf course, from time to time you will get a bigger enemy but I feel those are just..same as normal with more health. Shame.\n\nOutside of combat, you will explore Rapture, and you better do that, as there is a lot to find and collect!\nExpect health, ammo and money to spend at vendores, you can gather resources from which you can craft items, tonics which give and improve you passive bonuses in 3 categories, you can find special workshops to upgrade guns, and you can collect audio diaries as collectibles, to grab some interesting lore about a city and it's citizens. Not to mention that Little Sisters give you previous ADAM to upgrade your powers...if you can defeat Big Daddy, that is. \nWhere you can't go, you have to hack. Game features fun mini-game where you need to connect two points on a grid by making a pipe pathway. You can hack doors, cameras to detect enemies and trigger alarms, turrets to attack enemies on sight, and open certain doors. You better be good at that mini-game! \n\nThe only thing I could point out is stealth. While combing hacking skills, certain tonics, plasmids traps and more gives you an interesting stealth gameplay, I feel like game has it..because it has to be there to fir a theme? There is just so many items and places where stealth is not possible that combat is not avoidable plus it really takes a long time to actually be able to play a stealth game. It is not possible from beginning so why it is there at all? It's good it's there, some people might even enjoy it, but I don't see a point of it.  \n\nGame works like a dream. No crashes, drops, nothing. Although...\n\nAs for a sound, I found a one interesting issue. It's not always synchronized. You can use a weapon, fire half of magazine and first few bullets will fly quietly into chest of a fellow ahead of you. Then sound wakes up and only after a second or two you can actually hear that you shoot. Don't know what is the cause of it, as I played an Xbox 360 version of a game while while back and it worked without that issue. Rest of the game is perfect. Voice acting on point, soundtrack from 50's fits into a game, guns if you can hear them, sound really good.\n\nOverall I am not the first one to say game is amazing. Combat gives you a lot of freedom, story with a really good, yet after 11 years known twist, fitting soundtrack, great setting. Only issue is, for me, stealth. Well, this and sound issue.\n\n10/10! \"We all make choices, but in the end our choices make us.\"\n\nIf you enjoyed that review, check out my curator page!\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/31947302/", "timestamp_created": 1538076081, "timestamp_updated": 1538076081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.778370022773742676", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22996262": {"recommendationid": "22996262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046865724", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474638613}, "language": "english", "review": "Try this game, would you kindly?", "timestamp_created": 1463306916, "timestamp_updated": 1463306916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 75, "votes_funny": 70, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835612893104553223", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16848716": {"recommendationid": "16848716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140420831", "num_games_owned": 532, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457453858}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the few games I dare to call a MASTERPIECE\n\nThe story \nThe artsyle \nThe gameplay \n\nEVERYTHING is a complete MASTERPIECE.

All in all, this is a classic FPS to many gamers out there.\n [b][u]-Detailed breakdown review-[/u][/b]\n[b]Story:[/b]  Welcome to Rapture, a city devoid of morals and government. A city where the inventor can invent, where a scientist can do science without the government questioning ethics. Oh and one more thing about Rapture... It's at the bottom of the Sea.\nAs far as the story goes, you've just stumbled across rapture and now you need to try to get out of here alive, one problem Ryan {the founder of Rapture} is out to kill you. You will be helped along by a man named \"Atlas\" to navigate the various things you need to do to survive in Rapture.\nAs you progress you will meet several people who will either try to help you along your way, or kill you, or both. The game is very streamlined, as long as you check the map it is quite difficult to get lost in this game.\n\n[b]Game Play:[/b] The first FPS \"Story\" game that I played was Half Life 2, so when you start out a game with nothing but a Melee weapon, and then eventually pick up more weapons as the game progresses, I can't help but have flash backs to the good days of Half Life 2. I'm sure there's a name for that type of game mechanic development, but I will simply call it \"the half life progression\".\nYou start out with a pipe wrench, which I proceeded to hit everything with... Dead bodies, light switches, little sisters, pretty much anyone who wasn't a \"big daddy\" (Because big daddy's would knock me into tomorrow if I wasn't fighting my hardest). Sorry, I digress; I love that wrench. The first few weapons you get are: Wrench, Pistol, Shotgun. You get about 8 different weapons but I won't spoil the rest for you, they're fun, trust me.\nYou also get special abilities that require \"the blue stuff\" as I've so quaintly called it. What I want to call \"Mana\", \"Force skills\", and more names of blue energy meters is actually known as \"Plasmid\", which can only be restored by stabbing yourself in the arm with EVE syringes. You collect several abilities that use this energy source, the basic ones being: Shock, Fire, Telekinesis (Force pull *cough* ).\nThere is one more thing to note about game play: Hacking. To hack you play a simple mini game that you need to complete circuits on. Before you try to hack you're warned how difficulty the hack will be and then you need to navigate a slow moving flow through a maze to complete a circuit, I found most of these to be very easy. Which made this part of the game slightly forgettable, but it does give you a break from the hoards of splicers trying to slice off your face.\n\n [b]Achievements:[/b] At the time that I'm writing this, there are no achievements for this game, but sometime I would expect there to be a release updating and providing the Xbox achievements to steam users. (Date written: 10/23/14) \n\n[b]Price:[/b] BioShock's standard price is $19.99. As I always say, I recommend buying the game on a sale, or from a humble bundle. So far I've played roughly 15 hours of the game, on normal difficulty. So this isn't one of those games where you're going to spend a large amount of time playing it. And since there aren't achievements I won't be pumping in extra time.\n\n [b]Conclusion:[/b] Story: memorable. Game play: Logical. Achievements: Nonexistent. Price: Affordable. For everything else there's MasterCard. \n\n...I wanted to end it that way, but I'll elaborate a tiny bit more as to what kind of person would enjoy Bioshock; most FPS players would enjoy this game, and probably find it quite easy to play. This game has high intensity, it's nowhere near \"horror\" quality, but the game keeps you tense for what's about to happen to you next.\nI recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a bit of a different chance of pace for their typical First Person Shooter games, BioShock definitely sets itself apart from the rest; which is probably why it's such a favorite to many.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update April 10, 2015:\nHere's the URL to see my review for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/8850/]Bioshock 2[/url]\nHere's the URL to see my review for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/8870/]Bioshock Infinite[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1414101431, "timestamp_updated": 1428682150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820608019828796387", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15069038": {"recommendationid": "15069038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048587276", "num_games_owned": 1393, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1400432544}, "language": "english", "review": "Would you kindly read this review and buy this game? \n\nIf you didn't know, BioShock is claimed to be one of the most revolutionary FPS's games of all time, and that statement has plently of truth to it. It exceeds in almost all areas, but no gem is without its flaws. Unfortunately for BioShock, these flaws can be quite noticeable when you come across to them. DO NOT let that discourage you from playing this game though; it's an experience you don't want to miss.\n\nIn terms of presentation, BioShock fails to unimpress. The view of the underwater city of Rapture will amaze you when it emerges on your screen, http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=260940875\nand the steampunk art style is very unique, while being consistent throughout the game. Voice acting is perfect without a doubt, and characters such as Ryan Andrew and Sander Cohen will leave a lasting impression long after you finish the game. Sound design is extremly well-done as well: the whale-like moans from the hulking Big Daddies are very creepy, and the game only uses music for atmospheric reasons, http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=260940890 \nadding an extra layer of immersion that makes the game quite creepy, but never outright scary (which is not what the game is trying to do).\n\nThe story is the main highlight of BioShock, and presents themes and ideologies that are very applicable to reality, mainly the view of objectivism. Plot twists and unforgetable characters will make the experience a memorable ones, and each audio-diary will flesh out the world of Rapture, especially in events following up to the game. As for the main protagonist Jack, he's the typical silent playable character that every shooter seems to have, but his background information makes him quite interesting. Despite this, the story is damned near perfect, even if it feels ever-so rushed after the games huge revelation and twist.\n\nBioShock is a prime example of how video games are art, and is one you should not overlook. Even where it missteps in gameplay, it's story and presentation are grand throughout, and provide a unique experience you will not forget and will come back to again and again. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=261227078\nThere is no denying that BioShock is a game that will stand the test of time.", "timestamp_created": 1427421247, "timestamp_updated": 1427421247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 108, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.823155045509338379", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39526540": {"recommendationid": "39526540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137650691", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430275830}, "language": "english", "review": "Would you kindly play this game?", "timestamp_created": 1516591232, "timestamp_updated": 1516591232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.803191602230072021", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40820099": {"recommendationid": "40820099", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061492959", "num_games_owned": 1522, "num_reviews": 120, "playtime_forever": 1771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1521074835}, "language": "english", "review": "It \"only\" took me 10 years to finish it, but \"damn\", was it good!", "timestamp_created": 1521075792, "timestamp_updated": 1521075792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.77144855260848999", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23150477": {"recommendationid": "23150477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074952403", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466649844}, "language": "english", "review": "A true masterpiece.

I like to call it CRYTEK's \"Crysis\" of its time.\nI do not particularly care for FPS (usually play only the good AAA FPS titles), yet this game managed to give me such a good ever-lasting impression.\n\nSTORY:\nWelcome to the Underwater World of Rapture!\nYour commercial Jetliner crashes in the Ocean. You are the only survivor and manage to swim to a little piece of land. On this piece of land is a little submarine type vessel - you climb into it & pull a lever it causes the vessel to take you underwater. As you are submerging you see a whole city built underwater. This is Rapture. A place built for people who sought freedom from persecution, religion, politics & the morals/ethics of the world. You find out that they began to play around with Biological/Genetic enhancements and that somehow things went wrong.\n \nThe Setting is very interesting and beautiful but very disturbing as you will soon find out.\nThe Story can get a little confusing at times, but as I mentioned, there is a really awesome WTF Moment or Plot Twist. This happens about half way through the game and after that things should start making a little sense.\nTo enjoy the story to its fullest be sure to collect and listen to all audio logs. They contain vital story points, in depth information about the characters of Rapture and how it all fell apart.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nVery Unique FPS: Your using of Weapons, Different Types of Ammunition, Plasmids and the Environment all in combination (e.g. Shock Plasmid + Water Combo) to defeat your foes was something new at the time. It had never been done before and it works really great. Never did the combat feel dull or repetitive to me.\nThere are also light puzzles/riddles to solve and hidden areas to find that are loaded with loot & other goodies.\n\n\nWARNINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1) Play on the hardest difficulty so that you are forced to use use combos and converve ammuniton to survive.\n\n2) Do not [spoiler] kill Cohen after helping him with his \"masterpiece\". [/spoiler] It will pay off and provide additonal content later on in the game. Don't worry, you can kill him later :-)\n\n3) Collect and listen to all Audio Logs - There is a great guide with maps and photos to find them all - otherwise you will miss out on a lot of content.\n\n\nI remember the days when Bioshock 1 came out and everyone was astonished at the graphics, physics etc. and then everyone (including my friends and I) ran out to buy a better graphic card in order to be able to play it.\nShortly after Bioshock, Crysis hit and both looked great!\n\n\n[b]RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN EXPERIENCING THE \"SHOCK\" & PARTICULARY \"THE BIOSHOCK SERIES\" OF GAMES:[/b]\n\n- Play the classic \"System Shock\" games.\n\n- After that, play all three Bioshock Games + their DLCs (the SP DLCs are good). Play the games in the order that they were released.\n\n- Each time you beat each game,  Read/Watch a few analysises of the story/plots twists/ending/morals of each game before moving onto the next.\n\nDO ALL THIS, AND YOU WILL GET THE MOST OUT THESE WONDERFUL GAMES - YOU CAN THANK ME LATER!", "timestamp_created": 1396040595, "timestamp_updated": 1407784480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 225, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.802472352981567383", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26499322": {"recommendationid": "26499322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176943438", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478657790}, "language": "english", "review": "Bioshock needs to be experienced from zero.

In those days EB Games was oblivious to how exploitable their return policy was. I'd bought Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, took it home and finished it in two hours. Returned it half hour before the store closed and made a quick uninformed decision on a random game called BioShock. I'd not really heard anything about it and judging by the back cover it seemed like somewhat a first-person horror game.\n\nAnd over the next 12 eye bleeding hours that ensued, my fragile fourteen year old mind was exposed to themes of Objectivism, altruism, communism, horrific violence at the hands of little girls, superb voice acting and world building that rivals anything you've ever seen or read.\n\n9 or 8 years later, the Remastered editions are released. They are absolute trash. They crash constantly, the audio is messed up, can't change keybindings and aesthetically they're not all that much better. Do not waste your time with the remasters.\nThe original still looks good. Some .ini file tinkering before making it playable again but I finished it again in two play sessions largely uninterrupted. \n\nEverything narratively holds up. Andrew Ryan, Atlas and Tene are voice acted so brilliantly. The game has hardly any cut scenes, which I wish was a trend BioShock set. Lacking cut scenes may seem like a inconsequential point of praise but having the story build and play out directly as you play, creates an immersion factor hardly achieved by video games period. The themes posited by Ken Levine are almost still as profound as the first time I played it. Even knowing how the story plays out, I found myself evaluating every side to the conflicts and finding common ground with even the worst characters. Not that I find myself affectionate toward Ayn Rand and her philosphy but it's thematically something hardly explored in media at all, let alone a video game.\n\nMechanically and gameplay wise everything is still serviceable. I will say the gunplay lacks any impact and I feel like some weapons, especially the machine gun are hardly useful before acquiring upgrades. Largely many of the plasmids i found either uninteresting or not really useful. Telekiness seems to work combat wise for a scripted event but outside of that it's not worth much more than to access items outside your reach. Swarm seems completely usless as many enemies seem to continue on unaffected. And many others I found uninteresting or not at all worth swapping out the shock plasmid for.\nIn terms of the tonics, they seem to provide much more variety and possible ways of playing. Although why you wouldn't go every tonic that makes hacking easier is beyond me. Hacking has no right to be a god damn newspaper puzzle. I guess it's cool they made it more engaging than the typical RPG hacking or lock picking but for gods sake, it can be laborous. Thankfully acquiring auto-hack tools seems to quite easy to come by but the few hacks I had to do manually, I can't imagine doing all of them that way.\n\nIn terms of minor grips, having you edit .ini files to remedy mouse acceleration and also the fact the game crashes when some key bindings have been changed? This is surely something could be easily fixed with a patch and yet these are problems that persist into the Remasters (making them even more undesirable). The crosshairs and big gold objective marker make the UI ugly and if I'm correct I believe you can at least turn off the objective marker.\n\nA major gripe, there's an escort section at the end of the game.

The immersive undersea late 1950-60s city that you find yourself exploring is not only a very unique location for a game, but it's also just masterfully crafted. They really blew me away with just how interesting they were able to make every area. It was the kind of location I seriously would love to see in real life, a sort of dream environment as it were.\n\n- Equally interesting storylines, all told through various cassette tape diaries you find while playing. You rarely see any direct character interactions to tell the games story, but the voiced diary entries really tell well crafted stories, allowing the player to \"imagine\" what happened between these characters for themselves (often times with evidence of what went on being found later in your playthrough.) The overall theme hits on Ayn Randian ideology and it does a good job of getting the players to think a bit without it feeling too much like the devs were pushing some agenda on you. It's just a great game with unique storytelling, while the compelling undertones are exactly that; undertones.\n\n- The game does a good job of rewarding you for exploring it's environments with very gamey hidden stashes of Ammo, currency, food and powerups. This might seem to be a smaller deal, but I found it to be a core part of what had me interested in the game. They put a lot of \"secret\" areas and locations in the awesome zones you find yourself in, and you're almost always rewarded for finding them. Sometimes the reward is cheap and insignificant... but that's fine, at least the game puts in effort to show that things may not always be as they initially seem, and it really makes the zones feel dynamic and meaningful. You rarely enter a new area thinking, \"well this is obviously an empty room\" and as a result, you can look forward to uncovering whatever secrets might be hiding there.\n\n- The powerups themselves are pretty well fleshed out as well. I don't want to go too specific here, but there is a lot of customization options available to you when it comes to deciding how you want to play. These powerups also do a good job of making your progress feel meaningful in the game. It's fairly well paced as well, although I do have to say I felt like just using a select few the entire playthrough, but that could boil down to personal preference.\n\n- The game does linearity right. Open world syndrome is something I've come to dread from recent games, and honestly, this game realizes that simple objective based gameplay can be perfect, boundaries and walls can be a good thing in the same way that rules in sports don't ruin the fun as a result of how \"restricting\" they might be on the players. That said, even though you have very clear objectives throughout the play, the zones are large enough, and linked together in such a way that you could deviate if you were so inclined. This is my opinion of how games like this should be structured.\n\n- Spooky enemies with spooky sounds really do a good job of making you feel threatened at all times, even though the enemies were rarely actual threats on normal difficulty. It might be a bit gimmicky and jump scare-ish, but the voice lines of the enemy splicers are really crazy and fun to listen to, and they did this cheesy thing where they make an enemy sound like it's right behind you in loud volume, which just gave me the chills frequently. The enemies weren't behind me mind you, so it really was a misleading gimmick, and this could be argued as a Con for the game just lying to the player, but for me, it made the experience feel more like exploring a haunted environment, and that was enjoyable.\n\nThe Meh:\n\n- The gunplay itself just isn't my cup of tea. I didn't feel like the gameplay was particularly fast paced (like counterstrike or something for example) and as a result it just felt like bullet sponge encounters all day. To be fair, the powerups and your wide arsenal of weapons (which you're able to carry every weapon on you at all times) led to a sort of rock paper scissors mini game of using the right tool for the enemy at hand, lightning for electronics, armor piercing for big daddys, fire attacks on oil patches etc, but yeah, I personally found the combat to not be as compelling as the rest of the game (as I said, I'm not big on FPS gameplay.)\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The hacking minigame. I couldn't stand this aspect of the game after about the fifth thing I hacked, and believe me, it doesn't go away any time soon. Your lategame somewhat compensates for how tedious it becomes by offering you several powerups to make the process easier, but they also ramp up the difficulty of the hacks as the game goes on as well... I literally quit the game halfway in because of this stuff, and only recently jumped back in to finish it.\n\n\nSo yeah, overall the game was fantastic. Even one of my only complaints (the gunplay one) could be entirely disregarded if you happen to like FPS gameplay more than me. This was one of the more surprising games I have played to say the least, because I fully expected to hate it, and ultimately, I just really enjoyed my time with it somehow.\n\n9/10 if I had to score it (for those that enjoy FPS games), fk the hacking minigame basically. \n\nMy personal enjoyment was more like a 7/10, but that's just because I'm not into FPS games, but I can clearly tell it's amazing for people that do enjoy that stuff.", "timestamp_created": 1512979200, "timestamp_updated": 1513068812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.733416199684143066", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23448426": {"recommendationid": "23448426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055565670", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465148566}, "language": "english", "review": "Didn't know what to expect from this game.\n\nIn short, i'm glad I decided to play it.\n\nThe story is really good, and the atmosphere is spot on - creepy enemies, creepy areas...awesome looking guns.

It follows the story of Jack, who gets stranded at the bottom of the ocean in a forgotten art-deco city named Rapture. Fighting and being chased by lunatics, Jack must find a way to overthrough the corrupt city's dictator and escape back to the surface...but that's just the tip of the iceburg.\n\nBioshock is a very, very important game. In fact, as I played it for the roughly 11 hour campaign, I would constantly find myself stopping just to marvel at how uncondensably important this game was. 'There's the important character,' I would say. 'That's the important reveal.' I couldn't help but oggle at the supremely important themes and ideas, or the very very important vistas and design tropes. It indeed set a new bar for video-game storytelling with its rich and stylistic, yet still mechanically satisfying, world.\n\nThing is, by the time I got to the end of this monumentally important odyssey, I couldn't shake the feeling that in all its, admittedly, shiningly obvious and remarkable importantness, the game had sort of failed to connect with me. Ultimately it didn't seem like it actually went anywhere. The problem with the game, and indeed, most Ken Levine games, is that the ludonarrative is a writhing mess of very very important themes spiralling out in all directions like tentacles from a lovecraftian beast, each shaking tendril begging to have the honor of being the central plot thread. But by the time the game wraps up to a close, a very important man jumps off of a very important boat with an undeniably important harpoon gun, and kills the plot. And then you just sort of watch as it slowly sinks into the water, underwhelmingly, and the credits start to fade over the screen.\n\nIt's honestly a shame because there are hours of great non-linear level design with a fantastic, and not to mention important, art-deco style with mood setting period music and fantastic shading and texture-work, alongside some smooth and clever gameplay mechanics which encourage you to engross yourself in the world and pay attention in exchange for money and power. And the world Irrational Games created is sincerely a unique and fascinating one with a rich history and an enthralling tone. But then it all falls apart and dies by the end with several escalatingly bad decisions.\n\nUltimately I do recommend this game, because there's plenty of enjoyment to be had within its underwater glass walls, but I think I'd say Bioshock 2 is the superior game. It has the same engrossing world and equally fantastic level design, but vastly improved mechanics and a plot that actually chooses a theme to be its focal point.", "timestamp_created": 1527727768, "timestamp_updated": 1527727768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.70264887809753418", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18317075": {"recommendationid": "18317075", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076695183", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429466080}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic.

I could save a few compliments and shorten this rather passionate, but humble, homage. But no. When talking about BioShock, one should let the words flow, just like the essence of its beautiful concept flows richly and vividly through every character's line, every thematic poster hanging on a random wall, every bit of Art Deco reconstruction, and every trace of Andrew Ryan's infamous personality.\n\nWhen I first played this game, back in 2009, I couldn't believe my eyes. The compelling and psychologically deep story that I was witnessing should be in a book or something \"narratively more complex\". Back then, with all my ignorance and prejudice towards the potential of videogame storytelling, I hadn't realised what sin I was carrying on my mind. The way I've come to think is: BioShock should've always been what it is: a story-driven, linear first-person shooter that touches the deepest veins of your perceptions on notions of compassion, violence, regret, love, and themes such as mindless obedience, civil disorder, despotic leadership, dystopian lunacy, transhuman monstrosity, and other rather shocking motifs that this game courageously explores. Images of fear and perdition that make us cringe, but also touching scenes of sacrifice and loyalty. \n\nTroubled and oftentimes scary characters are all over the place (including the player-character).

In many respects closer to undersea horror, than a traditional FPS (maybe Sea-Life?) Bioshock is an experience that rewards the attentive player with a twisting and turning story that almost but not quite fulfils its initial promise. Now, where are the controls for this bathysphere? I want to see if I can find Chthulhu\u2026.(Recommended).[/quote]\n\nWriting a recommendation for a game like Bioshock is difficult. In part that\u2019s due to the simple fact that the potential buyer will already have a good idea (and most likely a relatively accurate one) of what a game of this pedigree is really like. Furthermore, Bioshock is iconic with its hulking Big Daddies and the malevolent innocence of the Little Sisters making their way into gaming iconography. Which means that in reality this should be a pretty brief and easy review\u2026well, let\u2019s hope it is?\n\nBioshock is in many respects a typical first person shooter. It has its standard array of weaponry, and as with any good FPS, features a host of slightly unusual powers and abilities that can be ranked up. What really sets Bioshock apart is the atmosphere and story, for whilst the game doesn\u2019t do anything egregious, the run and gun gameplay isn\u2019t outstanding either\u2026it\u2019s fun, but without the other elements backing it up it would pall quite quickly. Whilst we\u2019re here let\u2019s just get those aspects out of the way immediately. Bioshock features a typical range of armaments, and whilst my gut twisted when I started out with the ubiquitous Half-Life wrench, this soon makes way for everything from a Shotgun to a Chemical Sprayer, with each weapon generally boasting a variety of ammo types to boost its efficacy. Gunplay is solid, with headshots and special ammo taking down foes more efficiently than body shots, and at least on the normal difficulty level, ammo is never really that sparse giving the player the opportunity to experiment without penalty. \n\nWhat takes the combat up a notch is Bioshock\u2019s genetic conceit \u2013 your character can modify himself at various gene banks and gain the powers of various plasmids that he will find on his journey. While the weapon variety was standard fare it\u2019s here that we see flashes of inspiration. Fancy distracting and damaging your foes from afar? Try using Insect Swarm and firing bees at your opponents. Or why not immolate them with Incinerate. Perhaps you\u2019d like to charm your more dangerous foes into protecting you? Or confusing the security systems to do likewise? Or maybe it\u2019s just the good old fashioned lightning bolt that makes the most sense, stunning the opposition as you pummel (or shoot) them to death. There are 11 plasmid types in total, which can all be increased in rank to become more effective, and of which only a few can be selected at one time (depending upon how the player chooses to upgrade their character. Add to that the various gene tonics that confer a passive boost to your character and there are myriad options to explore when decking out the protagonist to cause as much havoc as possible.\n\nThe upgrade system is solid, but may frustrate some players with its rigid structure. Upgrades to your character and plasmids/tonics are paid for in ADAM. This resource is obtained from a specific enemy, of which there are a limited, fixed amount. This means that in any one playthrough there\u2019s a skill point limit \u2013 every purchase counts, and with some \u201cshops\u201d charging more than others it takes a wise or relaxed player to not worry about poor decision making. I found myself on more than one occasion ignoring interesting looking plasmids just in case the next upgrade station offered something more tantalising. Of course this isn\u2019t a problem for those planning multiple runs, but completionists should bear that in mind.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not the gunplay or special abilities that had me smiling like a loon about two thirds of the way through the game. Bioshock\u2019s plot is still golden, and for the majority of the game its story telling is fantastic. Needless to say I don\u2019t intend to go into any real specifics, and spoilers would mute the experience somewhat, but plot wise there\u2019s always a reason to push on until the bigger picture clicks into place. Rapture, Bioshock\u2019s sunken city and creation of the industrialist Andrew Ryan, offers an atmospheric and oppressive setting that on more than one occasion had me making comparisons to Dead Space. It\u2019s a haunting environment and one that\u2019s clearly seen better days, littered as it is with dead bodies, broken furniture and crazed denizens intent on putting a stop to your interference.  These denizens, boasting interesting dialogue both in and out of combat, are full of character thanks to these little snippets and their descent into self-modified madness is evident. \n\nThe scenery tells the story, almost as much as the audio logs that you\u2019ll discover as you explore the game (again reminiscent of Dead Space), and the voice acting in the game is superb. The various characters actually sound of the time (the game is set in 1960) and with the almost steampunk aesthetic of some of your surroundings, world building is something that the design team haven\u2019t skimped on. The brutish Big Daddies with their doleful wails and the malign Little Sisters are the real stars here, but certainly sound design is almost without fault. Level design is also always interesting, and whilst there might be one or two occasions where you\u2019ll scratch your head over where to go next (look closer, there\u2019s an elevator!) it\u2019s a pleasure to explore and advance to your next objective. \n\nThe glaring issue is that whilst the gameplay never takes a dip in quality, after the first sixty or seventy percent of the experience, the game\u2019s denouement has trouble living up to the high standard that\u2019s been established. The ultimate third of the game is interesting, but can\u2019t live up to the standards of that which has come before, and the final boss is a bit of a let-down. Which is a shame, but far from damning. For those that enjoy first person shooters with an interesting narrative and atmospheric locale, Bioshock is a definite recommendation. It does some things so well that despite a few of the shortcomings that present themselves, I\u2019d have a hard time warning people away. Recommended.\n\n[i][Reviewers note - despite owning both the original and the Remaster I opted to experience the former rather than the latter due to ageing PC hardware.

Yes, it is dated at this point, but man is it still a fantastic game. If you can't handle the older graphics, don't fret, BioShock Remastered just came out.\n\n[h1]Positive:[/h1]\n- Extremely atmospheric - you will be sitting on the edge of your seat for the majority of the game\n- Fantastic original story - I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't played BioShock yet, but it is truly amazing.\n- Do things YOUR way. Want to go in shooting? Fire away. Want to be stealthy? Sneak away. Want to hack things? No problemo. There are so many ways to handle each situation.\n- Exploring is rewarding. More ammo, health packs, crafting items, you name it. Also find audio diaries to get diverse insights into Raputure's history.\n- Difficulty is just right. Yes you will get stronger as you progress, but you will be punished if you make poor choices.\n- I still want to play this although I have finished it 3 times.\n\n[h1]Negative:[/h1]\n- Graphically the game looks a little old\n- It is a shame that you cannot equip a plasmid and weapon at the same time - either one or the other (this was fixed in BioShock 2)\n- The hacking system is laborious and dull (but still worth doing)\n- If you're easily frightened you will need some clean underwear on the side\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nThere really is no reason for you not to give BioShock a try, especially now that a remastered version is out. I guarantee you will not regret playing it. Like Portal, BioShock is an extremely rewarding and fulfilling experience.\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

A few years ago I restarted the game with the intent of finishing it, but managed to get about 2/3rds in before dropping out again.  I finally replayed this game in the year of our lord 2015, and for once finished it.  Let me get this out of the way up top: The game is 100% worth playing (or even replaying).\n\n[h1]Good Stuff:[/h1]\n-The setting is super original: an underwater laissez faire utopia filled with the best and brightest, ripped apart by civil war due in part to the discovery of a gene altering substance.\n-Combat is pretty good.  Tons of guns (that you can carry all at once!) and a variety of magic powers called \"Plasmids\" that vary from shooting fireballs to hacking turrets.\n-Passive buffs via tonics that you purchase/find and equip allow you to personalize your playstyle somewhat.\n-Varried enemy design, with thoughts taken into enemy placement in the level itself to provide interesting fights.\n-Great level design, from the layout to the art design.  Levels are open with multiple branches off the main 'hub' of each level that are typically explored throughout the level via progression towards your goal.  Although there is some backtracking, enemies are usually placed in a way that makes fights fun and interesting.\n-Water and particle effects are still pretty good.\n-Audio design is great, from the sounds of water puddling in hallways to the ambient effects your plasmids make when you equip them.  All the work goes into create a stellar atmosphere that lets you buy into the world.\n\n[h1]Bad Stuff:[/h1]\n-The first 2/3rds of the game are a bit predictable in terms of how the game delays your progress narratively. \n-The last act of the game is a bit more linear than the first 2/3rds, and the final fight really stinks.\n-Some people think the audio journals are an overused trope, but I personally liked them for how they build the backstory.\n-Switching between your gun and plasmid is annoying at first, but you'll get used to it with practice.\n-The hacking minigame got boring for me about 1/3rd through the game, but some people might like it.\n-Most of the textures have this shiny look to them that makes them look like plastic.\n\n[h1]Ugly Stuff:[/h1]\n-Be prepaired to work a bit to get this game running smoothly. I had a ton of crashes before turning off the steam-overlay and forcing the game to run in DX9 before it ran smoothly.  There are a ton of steam guides to help you fix that stuff up though.\n-Audio can hitch and cut-out during combat when too many sounds are playing at once.  I couldn't figure out how to fix this one, but luckily no dialogue is cut out.\n-Physics calculations in the game are played at 30 fps, making them stand out a bit on modern machines.\n-Options menu is a bit dated and you'll have to do some INI editing to adjust things like FOV and proper sensitivity. \n\n[h1]Verdict:[/h1]\nBioshock is still worth revisiting, if just for the story and gameplay alone.  It's a decently sized game and took me around 12 hours to beat, with the only downsides being that the final act is a bit lackluster and that the game looks dated and might take some playing around to get it to run without crashing.  But you're rewarded with a good shooter with a fantastic story and world that makes you interested to find out more every step of the way.\n\nTip: You probably want to up the difficulty, the mid game and onwards is pretty trivial on medium difficulty.", "timestamp_created": 1438504322, "timestamp_updated": 1439165374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.6587563157081604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42554057": {"recommendationid": "42554057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198303514452", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 1134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1528375263}, "language": "english", "review": "Now, would you kindly play the original game instead of the remaster?", "timestamp_created": 1528375439, "timestamp_updated": 1528375439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687974095344543457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10951418": {"recommendationid": "10951418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055069841", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1407723822}, "language": "english", "review": "Have you ever dreamed of mercilessly beating crack heads with wrenches and looting their corpses?
